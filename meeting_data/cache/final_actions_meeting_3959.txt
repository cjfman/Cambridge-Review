>> IS THE MEETING CLEARLY AUDIBLE TO YOU?
>> IT IS. YUP.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: PRESENT AND AUDIBLE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PRESENT.
>> MR. CLERK: SIX MEMBERS PRESENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, WE WELCOME YOU TO THE PRESENTATION
AND I WANT TO NOW PASS IT TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. IT SAY PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS
AFTERNOON TO OPEN UP THE MEETING WITH THIS SPECIAL PRESENTATION.
OVER THE SUMMER, WE ENLISTED A NUMBER OF CIVIC DESIGNERS WHO
WORKED WITH PUJA OF THE YWCA AND WORKED WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND
MENTOR TO LIFT UP, FOLLOW UP, TO EMPOWERMENT, LEADERSHIP, AND
ENGAGEMENT TO LOOK AT THE ACKERMAN ROOM, A FEW OF US HERE, WILL
KNOW WE HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ACKERMAN ROOM. WE
CAME UPON THE IDEA OPPOSED TO HAVING IT BE DONE BY THE COUNCIL,
THE COUNCIL LEADERSHIP, WE'D ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE. THROUGH GIRLS
ONLY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT, WE APPLIED TO BE A SITE FOR THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE. THROUGH THE MAYOR SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM, UNDER
THE LEADERSHIP OF PUJA AND SURI, THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PUT TO WORK
AS CIVIC DESIGNERS, OPPOSED TO TEEN WORKERS. WE WANTED TO LIFT UP
WHAT THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT. THEY STARTED
WITH A IT WASN'T A POLICY ORDER. WE HAD TO FIND THE IMPETUS
BEHIND THE ACKERMAN ROOM FROM THE CAMBRIDGE CHRONICLE. WE
COULDN'T FIND A POLICY ORDER, WE ASSUME WAS WRITTEN, TO MARK THIS
OCCASION. I'LL TELL YOU, BACK IN THE 1960S, IT WAS BROUGHT FORTH THE
IDEA THAT THE ROOM, WHICH WAS FORMERLY CALL THE WALNUT ROOM, BE
NAMED FOR BARBARA ACKERMAN, THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVERYBODY IS AS
MAYOR IN CAMBRIDGE. THE IDEA, ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, IS THAT
GOING FORWARD, THIS WOULD BE A PLACE THAT WOULD LIFT UP, IDENTIFY
AND MARK THE PRESENT OF WOMEN IN THE GOVERNMENT. WHAT
HAPPENED, THE ROOM WAS NAMED AFTER BARBARA, A PORTRAIT WAS PUT
OF HER DONE BY HER HUSBAND, WHICH HANGS IN THERE NOW. AND THEN
IT WAS FILLED UP WITH PICTURES OF MEN.
SO THE TASK THE CIVIC DESIGNERS TOOK ON WAS TO LOOK AT THAT. LET ME
NOT TELL THEIR STORY, LET THEM TELL THE STORY. I TURN IT OVER TO THE
MAYOR SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM CIVIC DESIGNERS.
>> JASMINE, YOU WANT TO START?
>> YES. I HAVE TO SHARE MY SCREEN. HONORABLE MAYOR, MEMBERS OF
THE CITY COUNCIL, CITY MANAGER, CITY STAFF, AND MEMBERS OF THE
COMMUNITY, I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU TO COMING TO OUR PRESENTATION.
I'M JASMINE, I'M AN 11TH GRADER AT RINDGE.


PAGE 2

Sept. 27, 2021

>> HI, I'M ESMEE AND A 11TH GRADER AT CONCORD ACADEMY.
>> I'M A TENTH GRADER AT CAMBRIDGE RINDGE AND LATIN.
>> WE ARE CIVIC YOUNG DESIGNERS THAT ARE HIRED TO RESEARCH WHO
SHOULD BE HONORED IN THE ACKERMAN ROOM. A ROOM IN CITY HALL. IT IS
THE PEOPLE'S ROOM JUST LIKE THIS BUILDING. IT BELONGS TO THE CITIZENS
OF CAMBRIDGE. IT BELONGS TO YOU AND YOU SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE
BEING HERE AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HERE.
WHO IS IGNORED IN THE CIVIC SPACES AND WHO IS HONORED IN THE CIVIC
SPACES? SO, TODAY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS WHO WE ARE
AND WHAT WE CARE ABOUT WITH THIS PROJECT. AND WE ARE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT THE DESIGN ISSUE, THE DESIGN PROCESS, DESIGN
OPPORTUNITY, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE.
SO, WE ARE A TEAM OF SEVEN TEEN CIVIC DESIGNERS AND CONSULTANTS
AND TWO LEARNS. HOLD ON. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? LET'S TAKE A
MOMENT TO DEFINE THE TERMS HERE.
>> NEXT SLIDE, JASMINE.
>> WAIT. I SWITCHED IT.
>> HOLD ON AND GO BACK.
>> WE ARE A TEAM OF CIVIC DESIGNERS, A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT USE
TOOL TO DESIGN TO BENEFIT THE PEOPLE. OKAY. BACK TO IT. BASED IN
CAMBRIDGE, THE MAYOR SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM FOR SEVEN WEEKS
AND WE STUDY AT CRLS AND CONCORD ACADEMY. AND YOUNG LEADERS TO
HELP MAKE CITY HALL MORE WELCOMING FOR ALL.
OUR DESIGN AND CONSULTING TEAM CONSIST OF ESMEE, HOPE, JASMINE,
LUNA, AND OTHERS. WE BELIEVE THAT DESIGN IS POLITICAL. WHICH MEANS
HOW WE DESIGN OUR CIVIC SPACES.
WHICH THEN MEANS WHO FEELS WELCOME IN OUR CIVIC SPACES. WHICH
THEN MEANS WHO IS REPRESENTED IN OUR CIVIC SPACES. AND WHAT
POLICIES GET PASSED IN OUR CIVIC SPACES. IT ALL GOES AROUND.
WE BELIEVE THAT BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE VALUES IS CRITICAL, THEY
SHAPE THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, AND HOW BY DESIGN. AND
VALUE DIVERSITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, CONSISTENCY. SO, BEFORE WE
BEGIN WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE IN THE ROOM, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF THE ROOM. FREDERICK, WHEN CREATING CITY HALL AND
PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR IT WANT IT TO BE INSPIRATION AND BELIEVES
THAT CIVIC BUILDINGS SHOULD TEACH CIVIC LESSONS. OVER 35 YEARS AGO,
THE FORMER MAYOR, PASSED A POLICY ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOMEN IN CAMBRIDGE. THAT YEAR, 1982, THE MAYOR
NAMED THE ROOM AFTER A FORMER MAYOR AND FIRST WOMAN MAYOR IN
CAMBRIDGE, BARBARA ACKERMAN. THIS IS THE CAMBRIDGE CHRONICLE, IT
SAYS:
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)


PAGE 3

Sept. 27, 2021

SINCE THEN, 12 OUT OF THE 13 PORTRAITS HONORING THE OFFICERS
WOMEN MAYOR OF CAMBRIDGE HAVE BEEN WHITE MEN. THIS ROOM IS
OPEN FOR THE COMMUNITY USE AND TO HOST TOURS AND IT IS CRITICAL
THE DESIGN WILL REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE CITY.
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE REPRESENTED IN THE ROOM AND HOW DID THEY GET
THERE AND WHAT CIVIC LESSONS DOES THE ROOM TEACH?
SO, THE DESIGN PROCESS. OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THE ROOM WHEN WE
FIRST CAME TO CITY HALL, WE NOTED... THAT ONLY A COUPLE OF US HAD
EVER BEEN TO CITY HALL BEFORE. ONLY ONE OF US KNEW WHAT THE
ACKERMAN ROOM WAS, KIND OF.
WE NOTED FEELING NERVOUS. FEELING LIKE WE NEEDED PERMISSION TO BE
THERE. FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE. THINKING IT LOOKED LIKE A MEDIEVAL
CASTLE FROM THE OUTSIDE. FEELING CLAUSTROPHOBIC BECAUSE OF THE
COLORS AND DIM LIGHTING IN PLACES AND WE NOTICED THAT THE
WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBILITY IS THROUGH THE BACK. WHEN WE FIRST
ENTERED THE ACKERMAN ROOM, WE WERE MET BY A WHITE MAN. A
SUPERVISOR, WOMAN OF COLOR, SAID WE BOOKED THE ROOM TO WHICH
SHE APPLIED. WHEN. LOOKING AT THE WATCH AND REMINDING US HE WAS
ON THE CALL. THE PORTRAITS OF WHITE MEN WE DIDN'T KNOW LOOK AT US.
WE RAISE THE OBSERVATIONS BECAUSE THEY ILLUSTRATE THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH CITY HALL AND REVEAL AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE CIVIC
DESIGN TO IMPROVE IT.
SO, WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACKERMAN ROOM WHEN WE
FIRST WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER. WE WROTE THEM DOWN AND WE
WONDER WHO RENTS IT OUT AND IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I SAID THAT
CITY HALL IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. WE WANT
TO KNOW WHO THE CITY MANAGER WAS AND DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS OUR
BUILDING.
HERE'S A CALL BACK TO THE QUOTE WE STARTED WITH. IT IS THE PEOPLE'S
ROOM JUST LIKE THIS BUILDING IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. IT BELONGS TO THE
CITIZENS OF CAMBRIDGE, IT BELONGS TO YOU AND YOU SHOULD FEEL
COMFORTABLE. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE. THAT WAS NOT REFLECTED
IN OUR INITIAL ENCOUNTERS.
DESIGN PROCESS. WE RESEARCH PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE ROOM.
WE HAD GUEST SPEAKERS COME IN. WE RESEARCH PEOPLE FROM
CAMBRIDGE WHO REPRESENTED OUR VALUES AND WE TOOK THE TIME TO
MEET AS A GROUP AND DISCUSS RESEARCH.
SO, THESE ARE THE GUEST SPEAKERS WE HAD. COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
THE DESIGN OPPORTUNITY. BLACK LIVES MATTER SIGN HUNG IN THE
WINDOW AND IT APPEARS TO BE AN INCLUSIVE PLACE OF RADICAL CHANGE.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS EQUALLY AS COMMON FOR THOSE VALUES NOT TO BE
HELD UP WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE SAME BUILDINGS. CITY HALL IS A
METAPHOR FOR THE CITY. ONE PLAGUED BY WHITE SUPREMACY, CLASSIST,


PAGE 4

Sept. 27, 2021

AND RACISM, HIDDEN UNDER THE FACADE OF BUILDINGS. WE SEE THE NEED
FOR CHANGE IN CAMBRIDGE. THAT BEGAN LONG AGO AND CONTINUES TO
GROW. THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT HONORING PEOPLE A PART OF THE RADICAL
CHANGE, ALONG WITH REDESIGNING CITY HALL TO MOVE BEYOND THE
PERFORMANCE OF ANTIRACISM, REPRESENTATION, AND INCLUSION. THIS
PROJECT IS A STARTING POINT. FOR THE ROOM, CITY HALL, AND CAMBRIDGE
AS A WHOLE. WE WANT THIS ROOM TO CONTINUE AND GROW AND
CHANGE. WE WANT OUR WORK TO RING THE CITY INTO THE SPACE AND FOR
PEOPLE TO WALK INTO THE ROOM AND SEE THEMSELVES IN THE PORTRAIT.
THAT WILL CATALYZE AN UNDERSTANDING FOR THE PUBLIC THAT CITY HALL IS
OUR PLACE, WITH OUR GOVERNMENT, AND THE PEOPLE ARE AT THE TOP OF
THE POWER BREAKDOWN IN CAMBRIDGE. THIS IS OUR SPACE THAT IS
HONORING PEOPLE FROM OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT WE ALL BELONG IN
CITY HALL.
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT REPRESENTATION IN PLACES IN POWER WILL CHANGE
FUTURES. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF FEELING LIKE YOU CAN BELONG.
SEEING SOMEONE COMING FROM THE SAME BACKGROUND AS YOU, CHANGE
THE STRUCTURE YOU RESIDE IN, IT WILL INSPIRE CHANGE. ONE OF THE CIVIC
DESIGNERS, LUNA, SAID, I KNOW THAT IF I HAD SEEN ASIAN AMERICANS
HONORED IN PLACES LIKE CITY HALL I WOULD PUT MYSELF IN THEIR POSITION
AND MAYBE WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED POLITICS AS A YOUNG CHILD IN
CAMBRIDGE.
THE DESIGN OPPORTUNITY. SO, OUR MAIN FOCUS WAS REPRESENTATION,
ACCESSIBILITY, AND HOW WE'D GET THE WORD OUT THERE ABOUT THE
ROOM. BEFORE, SO THIS IS A BEFORE DRAWING THAT HOPE, ONE OF THE
CIVIC DESIGNERS DID. THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT SIZES AND IN DIFFERENT
FRAMES, AND ALL THE PICTURES WERE OF WHITE MEN. AND THE ROOM
DIDN'T FEEL ORGANIZED OR WELCOMING AND ALL PICTURES WERE IN BLACK
AND WHITE.
SO, THE AFTER THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS... WE WOULD HAVE PICTURES OF
DIVERSE PEOPLE, WHO REPRESENT OUR VALUES IN THE SAME SIZE AND
COLOR FRAMES AND THE PORTRAITS WILL BE IN DIFFERENT MEDIUMS. SO, IT
COULD BE A COLLAGE, A PAINTING, OR A PHOTOGRAPH. AND THE PORTRAITS
WILL BE BOTH OF PEOPLE AND OF ORGANIZATIONS. AND EACH PORTRAIT
WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A QR CODE, WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER.
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL
RESEARCHED THIS SUMMER. PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO HONOR IN
THE ACKERMAN ROOM. I WOULD PREFACE THEY ARE SUGGESTIONS AND WE
ARE OPEN TO MORE. IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OR PEOPLE IN MIND, PLEASE
LET US KNOW. I RESEARCHED THE MARGARET FULLER HOUSE. AND
CAROLINE HUNTER. I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE MARGARET FULLER HOUSE,
THEY DO COMMUNITY OUTREACH WORK IN THE PORT AND HUNTER WAS THE
VICE PRINCIPAL AT RINDGE.
SO, WE PROPOSE THAT HAVING THE NAMES AND SHORT BIOS UNDER EACH
PORTRAIT WITH A QR CODE THAT WILL LEAD TO A WEBSITE WITH MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT

PAGE 5

Sept. 27, 2021

BROUGHT THEM INTO THE ROOM. SO, AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE IS A
PORTRAIT, A BLURB ABOUT THEM, AND A QR CODE TO SCAN, WHICH WILL
HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM. AND SO THE WEBSITE, ON THE
NEXT SLIDE, THIS IS WHAT THE WEBSITE WOULD LOOK LIKE. RIGHT THERE,
YOU HAVE A BLURB ABOUT WHAT THE PROJECT WAS AND EACH INDIVIDUAL
PERSON WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN PAGE WITH ALL OF THE SOURCES AND
WAYS TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM. SO, IF SOMEONE IS
REALLY INTERESTED, THEY ARE WELCOME TO HAVE ACCESS TO LOTS OF
INFORMATION OR THEY JUST WANT TO STROLL BY, THEY DON'T HAVE TO
READ TOO MUCH.
THIS IS AMY CHIN GUEN. SHE WAS A SOCIAL WORKER AND DID A LOT OF
WORK FOR SOCIAL WORK IN CHINATOWN. AND WE ALSO PROPOSE HAVING A
TOUCH SCREEN WITH AUDIO TRANSLATION THAT VISITORS CAN USE TO
ACCESS THE WEBSITE AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE HISTORY AND DESIGN OF
CITY HALL. SO IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY, EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
PHONE OR A PHONE WITH INTERNET. AND WE'LL ASK PEOPLE FOR FEEDBACK
ON THE DESIGN ON THIS TABLET SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP AND CHANGE
THE ROOM AS PEOPLE SEE FIT.
WHEN WE FIRST JOINED THE CIVIC DESIGN TEAM, MANY OF US DOESN'T
KNOW CITY HALL WAS A PUBLIC BUILDING. LET ALONE PEOPLE WITH RESERVE
THE ROOM. THE WAY TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE AND MAKE PEOPLE
WELCOME, SOCIAL MEDIA, COMMUNICATION, RUN BY DESIGNERS, HOSTING
AND CONNECTING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND CRLS CLUBS.
AND SIGNAGE FOR THE ACKERMAN ROOM, CHANGE THE SIGN TO THE NAME
THE PUBLIC CONFERENCE SPACE, WHICH WOULD BE IN BRAILLE SO
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT IS ACCESSIBLE. AND STEPS FOR HOW TO BOOK THE
ROOM, POST ONLINE, ON THE WEBSITE AND ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE
TABLET, WHICH WOULD BE TRANSLATED INTO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AND
WE LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING A SMALL SNACK, LIKE GRANOLA BARS OR
WATER AVAILABLE IN THE ROOM. BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE OF BREAKING
BREAD, WHICH WE ALL REALLY APPRECIATE.
>> FOR THE CHANGES TO COME TO FRUITION, OUR CIVIC DESIGNERS HAVE
TO COME TOGETHER TO BRING THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU AND IT TOOK
OVER SIX WEEKS AND IN THE WEEKS WE BEGAN THE JOURNEY OF LEARNING
ABOUT CITY HALL. AND WHEN WE TOOK CLOSER LOOK INTO THE ROOM AND
LOOKED FOR THE MEN THAT WERE IN THE ROOM, WE COULD FIND NOTHING
ON THEM. AND SO THERE WAS JUST 12 WHITE MEN IN THAT ROOM THAT WE
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT AND WHY THEY WERE THERE.
SO, THAT HAD RUN INTO TROUBLE WITH FIGURING OUT WHY THEY WERE PUT
THERE. AND DURING OUR TIME AS A TEAM, WE MET WITH MANY SPEAKERS,
AS YOU SAW AND FROM THE SPEAKERS, WE LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF
REPRESENTATION. AND HOW IT SPEAKS TO THE COMMUNITY. AND ALSO, IT
TELLS US THAT THE DESIGN ROOM CAN TELL A STORY. CIVIC DESIGNERS WE
KNOW IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT FACT AND AS INDIVIDUALS IN A TEAM,
THROUGH RESEARCH, WE GATHERED THE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU SAW TO BE
HONORED IN THE BARBARA ACKERMAN ROOM. WE ARE LOOKING FOR


PAGE 6

Sept. 27, 2021

OTHER SUGGESTIONS.
WE HOPE THAT THE BARBARA ACKERMAN ROOM WILL CONTINUE TO
CHANGE AND HONOR UPCOMING GENERATIONS OF CHANGE MAKERS. WE
WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THIS PROGRAM
AND CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT STEPS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE TEAM,
THE MAYOR'S SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT TEAM, TECH SUPPORT, AND
OTHERS WHO ARE NOT HERE TO JOIN AND PEOPLE WHO WENT TO OUR
SCHOOL AND COULDN'T BE HERE. WE REPRESENT FOR THEMSELVES AND WE
WANT TO THANK JASMINE FOR BEING THE TECHNICAL EXPERT TONIGHT.
>> I THINK THAT'S THE CONCLUSION. ANYBODY HAVE I KNOW WE HAVE TO
START OUR MEETING AT 5:30.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FIRST GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR WE THANK
YOU FOR ALLOWING OUR CIVIC DESIGNERS TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS
A SPEAKER SAID, THE WORK ECLIPSE THE SEVEN WEEKS AND ONE OF THE
PROPOSALS, THROUGH THE MAYOR'S SUMMER YOUTH PROGRAM, A LOT OF
THEM ARE STILL AROUND, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE DAYS FREE. WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP. THEY RECOMMENDED, HERE'S
PEOPLE THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT. WE'RE NOT HELD TO IT. THE IDEA IS
THAT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING IN THIS ROOM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO IT IS
NAME AFTER THE FIRST WOMAN MAYOR, HISTORICAL RECORD SAYS, IT
SHOULD BE LIFTING UP WOMEN AND DOESN'T. WHAT I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH, THEY TOOK IT SO MUCH FURTHER THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT BY SAYING, TELL THE STORY. PUT A QR CODE. PUT UP A DEVICE THAT
SAYS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO
SEE WHAT THE PERSON IS ABOUT. AND THAT'S VERY TRUE ABOUT, EVEN IN
THIS ROOM, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON THE WALL, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO IS ON THE WALL.
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THEY PUT
TOGETHER AND THEIR THOUGHTFULNESS. AGAIN, THE PEOPLE THEY
SUGGESTED WERE FOLKS THEY FELT THEY WANTED TO RESEARCH. I'M
HOPING AND I'LL PROBABLY BRING IN A POLICY ORDER OR SOMETHING TO
SAY HOW DO WE CARRY THIS CIVIC DESIGN WORK FORWARD. NOT US, BUT
THEM. THEY STARTED THE WORK AND THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO FINISH IT. I WILL YIELD THE FLOOR TO SEE IF ANY OF MY
COLLEAGUES, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR ANY
COLLEAGUES HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IN THE BRIEF TIME WE HAVE
THEM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M SO EXCITED TO HEAR THIS
PRESENTATION. I WILL SAY, THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, I
REMEMBER HAVING A COUPLE OF CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND YOU
SAID, WE GOT THIS. WHEN I SAID WHAT ARE THE 12 WHITE MEN DOING IN
THE ROOM AND ONLY ONE PICTURE. YOU KNEW THERE WAS A TEAM OF


PAGE 7

Sept. 27, 2021

INCREDIBLE CIVIC TEAM THAT WAS GOING TO WORK ON IT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: CIVIC DESIGNERS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WAS EXCITED AND AWAITING THIS. I LOVE THE
IDEA OF COMING FORWARD WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BROADER REACH
OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE CITY TO PARTICIPATE, COME UP WITH NAMES. I
WILL SAY IT WAS MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS BEFORE ANY OF THOSE CIVIC
DESIGNERS WERE BORN THAT I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST WOMEN STUDIES
THESIS THAT WAS DONE AND HI TO FIGHT REALLY HARD. AND SO MUCH
WONDERFUL WENDY'S HOMETOWN HERO HISTORY HERE. HARVARD DIDN'T
HAVE THE STUDIES, IT WAS VERY EXCITING TO HAVE THE IDEA, AS YOU
NOTED, TO EXPAND THIS AND HAVE THE TEAM WORK WITH FOLKS ACROSS
THE CITY TO COME UP WITH SOME OTHER NAMES OF PEOPLE WE MAY
INCLUDE. AND FIGURE OUT HOW IT IS WE DECIDE WHO OF THE MANY,
MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN THE CITY CAN BE INCLUDED. I'M VERY EXCITED
WE'RE AT THIS POINT. I'M AWED AND INSPIRED BY THIS GROUP OF CIVIC
DESIGNERS AND GRATEFUL TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR LEADING THIS
EFFORT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND TO THE WONDERFUL PRESENTERS WHO ARE
HERE TODAY THINKING ABOUT THIS SPACE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WHEN I
FIRST GOT ON THE COUNCIL AND WALKED INTO THE BARBARA ACKERMAN
ROOM, FIRST FEMALE MAYOR OF CAMBRIDGE AND THOUGHT WHAT?
THERE'S ONE BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT OF BARBARA ACKERMAN AND THE REST
ARE PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW AND DON'T SEEM TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
SPIRIT. I'M EXCITED WE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
ARE LEADING THE LARGE, AND THE WAY, AND SHOWING US WHAT TRUE
EQUITY LOOKS LIKE IN BRINGING THE PEOPLE INTO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE.
THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. ADD AN ARCHITECT AND DESIGNER
OF PUBLIC SPACES, I WILL CONGRATULATE YOU FOR HELPING US REALIZE
WHAT AN UNCOMFORTABLE ROOM THAT ROOM IS WHEN YOU DO LOOK
AROUND AT THE PICTURES. IT FEELS LIKE A 1950S TV SHOW. I WOULD ASK
YOU TO THINK BROADER AS YOU GET OLDER ABOUT WHAT IS PUBLIC SPACE
OUTSIDE TELL YOU. AND HOW CAN WE MAKE THOSE SPACES FEEL LIKE THEY
REPRESENT PEOPLE FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. YOU INTELLECTUALLY
STARTED SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES US, BUT I HOPE IT INSPIRES YOU TO
LOOK AT ALL PUBLIC SPACE AS CREATIVELY AND AS STRONGLY AS YOU HAVE.
CONGRATULATIONS! THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT I ECHO MY COLLEAGUES AND
APPRECIATE THE WORK AROUND THIS. SO EXCITING AND I'M REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT YOU ALL DO NEXT. I'M SURE SOME OF YOU,
MAYBE ALL OF YOU, WILL END UP ON OUR WALLS ONE DAY HOPEFULLY. I
WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER ON
NEXT STEPS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE THE WORK. THE
IMPORTANT WORK ON THIS. WITH THAT, THANK YOU FOR THE

Public Comment

>> FIRST PERSON THAT SIGNED UP IS JULIET SIMPSON.
>> HI, I'M A RESIDENT AT ONE BROOKLINE PLACE APARTMENT 304 AND I
WILL SPEAK ABOUT COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S POLICY ORDER CONCERNING
THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. YOU ARE AWARE OF THE FACT, THERE WAS VERY
LITTLE COMMUNICATION ON THE FACT THAT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS
WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE MUCH REDUCED CAPACITY THIS YEAR HAS REALLY
HARMED A LOT OF FAMILIES. I'M A SINGLE PARENT. I DON'T HAVE FAMILY
OR RELATIVES NEARBY SO I DON'T HAVE BACKUP FOR CHILD CARE AND HAVE
A 9 5 JOB AND I'M REQUIRED TO BE BACK IN THE JOB FULL TIME. CHILDCARE
IN THE AFTERNOON IS VERY DIFFICULT. I APPLAUD THE COMMITMENT TO
EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE AREN'T BEING SERVED IN THE
PAST BY THE EARLIER MODELS OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. HOWEVER, THE
LACK OF COMMUNICATION AROUND HOW THINGS WERE CHANGED AND
HOW DRAMATICALLY IS A REAL RESULTED IN A HARDSHIP FOR ME.
I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE PROBLEM IS TRYING TO FIND STAFF JUST
TEACHERS FOR THE KIDS. WHEN I LOOKED AND TRIED TO FIND OUT HOW
MANY PEOPLE THEY LOOKED FOR, WHAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS WAS
LIKE, HOW MUCH THEY WERE PAYING, IT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND
THAT INFORMATION. IT MAY BE THAT FINDING STAFF COULD BE DONE IN A
MORE EFFECTIVE WAY. ADVERTISING IN DIFFERENT PLACES, MAYBE PUTTING
SOMETHING ON THE WEBSITE, COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THAT HAS BEEN VERY
DIFFICULT. ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT SEEMS THAT
PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE WAS THAT THERE WASN'T ANY THERE WASN'T
VERY MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH COMMUNICATION WITH AND FROM PARENTS
AND PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE THE FORMATION OF A PARENT ADVISORY
BOARD TO HELP GUIDE DHSP IN THEIR FUTURE CHOICES. AND DESIGNS FOR
REFORMATTING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS COULD BE HELPFUL. I'D BE
WILLING TO SERVE ON A PANEL AND WILL I'M SURE MANY OTHER FAMILIES IN
CAMBRIDGE WOULD BE AS WELL.
THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING I WANTED TO SAY AND I FORGOT. I
UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LARGER CONVERSATION THAT HAS TO GO ON AND A
MORE LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO MAKING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS
SERVE AS MANY FAMILIES IN CAMBRIDGE AS POSSIBLE. I ALSO HAVE AN
IMMEDIATE NEED RIGHT NOW. I'M SCRAMBLING FOR AFTER SCHOOL CARE
RIGHT NOW. I'M TRYING TO FIND A BABY SITTER RIGHT NOW. AND IT
WOULD BE GREAT IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE IN ADDITION TO A LONGER
TERM PLANNING. I'D BE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN AND I'M SURE MANY FAMILIES
WOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THEIR SAY. IF SOMETHING COULD
BE DONE SOON, THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY HELPFUL TO MY FAMILY.
THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. THE NEXT PERSON IN OUR ZOOM


PAGE 10

GERARDO?
>> GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, WE CAN. GO AHEAD.
>> YES. I'M THE FATHER OF A THIRD GRADER. AND I'M HERE TO BRING TO
THE ATTENTION OF THE REALITY OF MANY FAMILIES NOT GIVEN A SEAT FOR
THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THIS YEAR. THE
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, INTRODUCED SYSTEMIC CHANGES. THE
CHANGES WOULD INFORM ONLY LAST HOURS AND THE RESULTS WERE
PROVIDED DAYS BEFORE STARTING THE SCHOOL YEAR. THE NEW SYSTEM
ALSO REDUCED THE NUMBERS OF SPORTS FOR FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN
HISTORICALLY SERVED BY THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL. TODAY THERE ARE
MANY PARENT THAT NEED AFTER SCHOOL FOR THE KIDS TO KEEP JOBS AND
TO THRIVE IN AN EXPENSIVE CITY LIKE CAMBRIDGE. IT SEEMS AS CAMBRIDGE
IGNORED THAT CRISIS. AFTER WAITING MORE THAN 20 DAYS AND WITH THE
INTERVENTION OF SEVERAL COUNCILLORS I GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM
THE LEADERSHIP. THEY ARE FACING MANY CHALLENGES AND SEEM TO
EXCEPT THE FACT THERE IS NOTHING MORE THEY CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE
COMMUNITY SCHOOL THIS FALL.
I SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE FROM COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN TO OBTAIN A
REPORT FROM THEM ABOUT THE CHANGES IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL
PROGRAMS. THIS INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKE
AND IMPROVE THE SITUATION IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE ARE STILL IN
NEED NEED A SOLUTION NOW. IT IS REALLY CONCERNING THAT THE
LEADERSHIP, THE CITY MANAGEMENT, OR THE CITY COUNCIL, ACCEPT THE
IDEA THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO NOW TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION.
PLEASE, IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO MAKE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH
MORE OPTIONS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. WHAT WE NEED IS THE
CERTAINTY THAT YOU WILL NOT GIVE UP ON US. IT MAY NOT WORK, MAYBE
NOT FOR ALL OF US, BUT PLEASE DO NOT GIVE UP. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LYNN MARGHERIO.
>> HI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE AND THANK YOU TO VICE
MAYOR MALLON AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI FOR SPONSORING RESOLUTION 2021,
NUMBER 215 IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL DIAPER NEED AWARENESS
WEEK. AND FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL AND THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE, ALWAYS BEING AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER SUPPORTING
CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITIES. I'M HERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE ONE IN
THREE FAMILIES IN MASSACHUSETTS DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO
DIAPERS AND AS A RESULT, BABIES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RASHES AND
INFECTIONS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE FEELING INCREASED STRESS. I'M
LYNN, FOUNDER AND CEO OF CRADLES TO CRAYONS AND HAVE BEEN A
RESIDENT FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. IN CRADLES TO CRAYONS, 20 YEARS
OF OPERATION, WE SERVED NEARLY 3 MILLION CHILDREN IN
MASSACHUSETTS, PENNSYLVANIA, ILLINOIS, AND NEW YORK, WITH
CRITICALLY NEEDED BASIC ESSENTIAL LIKE CLOTHING, SHOES, SCHOOL

PAGE 11

Sept. 27, 2021

SUPPLIES AND DIAPERS. WE SEE EVERY DAY HOW SERIOUS THE NEED IS,
ESPECIALLY HIGHLIGHTED WITH THE PAST 18 MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC.
SINCE MARCH OF 2020, WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED FIVE AND HALF MILLION
DIAPERS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND OVER 11 MILLION THROUGHOUT THE
WHOLE NETWORK. AND NEARLY HALF A MILLION OF THESE HAVE GONE TO
FAMILIES IN CAMBRIDGE. TOMORROW WE TAKE SIX PALLETS OF DIAPERS TO
THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY CENTER RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM CITY
HALL IN RIVERSIDE. THERE ARE NO STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
BENEFITS SPECIFIC TO PREVENTING DIAPER NEED. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT
ANY CAREGIVER HAS TO KEEP A CHILD IN DIRTY DIAPERS OR RINSE OUT
DISPOSABLE DIAPERS. THIS PUTS CHILDREN'S HEALTH AT RISK AND LEADS TO
INFECTION. WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT AS A WELL ESTABLISHED
ORGANIZATION WITH THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO SO, WE CAN PIVOT
THE FOCUS TO DIAPERS WHEN THEY BECAME INACCESSIBLE. THERE ARE NOT
ENOUGH ORGANIZATIONS TO COVER THE NEED IN CAMBRIDGE, IN
MASSACHUSETTS, OR IN THE UNITED STATES.
THE CRISIS EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IF
WE DON'T TAKE MORE ACTION. PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT DIAPER
DISTRIBUTION EFFORTS IN CAMBRIDGE TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
OURS, AND OUR PARTNERS AND THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK
NETWORK AND TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION, LIKE THE DIAPER BENEFIT PILOT
PROGRAM IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THE DIAPER NEED ACT OF 2021. WE
NEED YOUR ATTENTION, PRIORITIZATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING BACK TO EMEE ON THE ZOOM.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SPEAKING TO POLICY ORDER AROUND POLICY
ORDER 201. THIS IS THE KNEE JERK REACTION FROM PRIVILEGE FAMILIES AND
PARENTS AND FAILS TO ADDRESS THE NEED OF REAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS
AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO ALL. LOOKING AT THE ORDER, IT CONTAINS NOT
ONE MENTION OF EQUITY IN THE ENTIRETY. I SEE DEMANDS FOR
INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIFIC CHANGES ABOUT PROGRAMMING, HOW
MANY AND WHAT TYPES OF STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED, COMPARED TO
PREVIOUS YEARS. AND WHAT TYPES OF OBSTACLES EXIST, NEW LOTTERY
SYSTEM, TYPES OF OUTREACH, ET CETERA. HOWEVER, I DON'T SEE A
WHEREAS, HIGH PRIORITY FAMILIES MUST RECEIVE THE INFORMATION AND
REPORT THE BARRIERS THEY FACE AND BECAUSE OF EQUITY DEMANDED. THE
ORDER THIS DATA BE PROVIDED TO A CAREGIVER, ADVOCACY COUNCIL, THAT
IS COMPRISED OF GIVERS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN MARGINALIZED AND
CALLED HIGH PRIORITY HAVE NOT BEEN THE TRUE RECIPIENTS OF THAT HIGH
PRIORITY IN THE CITY.
THIS IS NOT TO SAY THIS MEETING IS NOT IMPORTANT OR THIS INFORMATION
IS NOT NEEDED, IT IS WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT WE CAN LEARN WHAT
WORKS OR WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.
THE ISSUE IS HOW THIS INFORMATION IS BEING DEMANDED AND THE
RESPONSE THROUGH THE DEMAND. WE ALL MUST HAVE WE MUST HAVE
THIS INFORMATION AND HONESTLY, IT WAS NEEDED DECADES AGO. I


PAGE 12

Sept. 27, 2021

UNDERSTAND IT, BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE FEELING ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED,
THIS INFORMATION MUST BE PROVIDED NOW. WHY THE OUTRAGE NOW
AND WHY THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE NOW? ACCOUNTABILITY MUST OCCUR
AND INFORMATION NOTIFICATION MUST BE PROVIDED. OUR COMMUNITY
MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WHAT
DOES IT SAY ABOUT THIS BODY THAT NOW IT IS AN URGENT POLICY ORDER
THAT DHSP MUST RESPOND TO. THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT
CAREGIVERS ARE EXPRESSING. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF
COMMUNICATIONS DO PARENTS PREFER TO RECEIVE, COMMUNICATIONS
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF DHSP, AROUND REGISTRATION PROCESS, COSTS,
AND TIMELINES. HOW WELL DO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS CURRENTLY
BEING SENT TO FAMILIES. ALSO, MORE SPECIFICALLY, HOW WELL AND
WHERE, WHEREAS WE ARE NOT WHERE NOT ARE THE CURRENT OFFERINGS
WORKING FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHILDCARE NEEDS FROM 2 6. WHILE IT
SEEMS WE MOVE FORWARD EQUITY, EQUITY MUST HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT
SERVES THE FAMILIES THAT IT IS GEARED TOWARD AND NOT IN A WAY THAT
EQUITY IS FOR ALL. WHEN EQUITY WHEN PRIVILEGE IS TESTED, THAT'S
WHEN EQUITY SEEMS A PROBLEM. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE
EQUITY IS BEING APPLIED HERE AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE VOICES THAT
NEED TO BE HEARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON WE HAVE IS... (INAUDIBLE NAME).
>> MARIE IS NOT ON THE ZOOM. HEATHER HOFFMAN, GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. I WANTED TO START OUT WITH THANKS FOR
THE PRESENTERS IN THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM BEFORE THE MEETING.
THANKS FOR DISCUSSING SOMETHING THAT WE DEAL WITH IN PUBLIC
COMMENT. THE VALUE OF MAKING SURE THAT PUBLIC SPACE AND PUBLIC
ABILITY TO SPEAK TO OUR ELECTED AND UNELECTED LEADERS FEELS PUBLIC
AND ALSO HOW IMPORTANT DESIGN IS IN MAKING GOOD SPACES, BOTH
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.
SO CONTINUING ON, WITH RESPECT TO THE FAIR HOUSE, GRANTS, I'M VERY
HAPPY TO SEE THE CONTINUED EFFORTS TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES.
WE KNOW AVOIDING HOMELESSNESS IS BETTER THAN DEALING WITH
HOMELESSNESS. WITH RESPECT TO THE ITEMS REGARDING HAITIAN AND
OTHER ASYLUM SEEKERS, MOST OF YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN FLORIDA. AND
I REMEMBER VIVIDLY HOW DIFFERENTLY HAITIAN REFUGEES WERE TREATED
VERSUS CUBAN REFUGEES. CUBANS ARE WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS AND
THE HAITIANS WERE NOT. AND EXCEPT FOR THE IN FACT NOW WE ARE VERY
NICE TO CUBE WE ARE NOT NICE TO CUBANS EITHER, JOINING WE HAVE
CHANGED. IT IS SHAMEFUL. I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THESE ON THE AGENDA.
WITH RESPECT TO 689 MASS AVENUE. I'M THRILLED YES, WE SHOULD TAKE
THE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO BUY BUILDINGS WHEN THEY BECOME
AVAILABLE. AND USE THEM FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES. WITH RESPECT TO THE
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT, I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THE VERY
IMPORTANT THING THAT IS ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE REPORT, THE
PROPONENTS SAID THEMSELVES THAT THIS WAS AIMED AT RICH PEOPLE.
AND BENEFITTING RICH PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

PAGE 13

Sept. 27, 2021

HEALTH PROTECTION ACT. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE DRAFTERS, I WAS
UNAWARE IT HAD PASSED THE SENATE AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT
CAN SIGN IT, WHICH I'M SURE HE WOULD DO, UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. SO, I
HOPE THAT WORKS ITS WAY IN THERE OR THAT YOU WILL POINT OUT WHEN
IT COMES TIME THAT I JUST MISSED IT.
YES, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I'M PLEASED THAT MY
CONGRESSWOMAN, MS. PRESLEY, WHO REPRESENTS A BIG PART OF
CAMBRIDGE, IS THE LEAD PROPONENT ON THAT AND I HOPE IT PASSES
BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY NEED IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, DO WE HAVE AMARA DONOVAN?
>> YUP. AND I'M HERE TODAY ASKING THAT THE ORDER REGARDING DHSP
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM TO BE REWRITTEN TO HELP THOSE IMPACTED BY
INEQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. I'M ALSO
HERE TODAY TO PUT MY PRIVILEGE ON THE LINE AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BY THE CITY AND THAT'S
WHAT EQUITY AND ANTIRACISM MEANS. I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF GOING
THROUGH THE WORLD A BIRACIAL WOMAN PRESENTING AS WHITE AND
ENGAGING WITH THE RECORD AS A RADICAL LENS.
BECAUSE OF MY SKIN, EDUCATION, AND PRIVILEGE, I HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN FOR MY CHILD IN THE CITY. MY CHILD IS
ATTENDING A NEW SCHOOL THIS YEAR AND WE HAD RECEIVED NO
INFORMATION ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS UNTIL SCHOOL BEGAN. I
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO VOLUNTEER THAT I KNEW ABOUT THE AFTER
SCHOOL OPTION. I WAS READILY GIVEN DIRECT CONTACT INFORMATION FOR
REGISTERING, AND IN WITH THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF REGISTRATION AND
THE FRAMING THAT IS HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE THE NEED FOR MY FAMILY
BEFORE THE INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO ME AS A NEW FAMILY FROM THE
SCHOOL.
THIS INFORMATION, PREPARATION, AND CONNECTION IS NOT THE
EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES WHO NEED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING THE
MOST. THIS IS A CITY OF WHO KNOWS WHO, A DIVIDE BETWEEN THE
RESOURCE QUARTERS AND THE UNDERSERVED. IF YOU BELIEVE IN EQUITY,
WE MUST CENTER THOSE MOST IMPACTED AND IN NEED OF RESOURCES AND
NOT THOSE THAT ARE MOST UPSET AND MOST LOUD. PRIVILEGE FAMILIES
GET A TASTE OF WHAT FAMILIES OF COLOR OF AND LOW SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS EXPERIENCE ON THE DAILY. IT IS A STRUGGLE TO FEEL
UNSUPPORTED, STRUGGLE TO FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILDREN, AND IT IS UNFAIR.
THIS COUNCIL MUST REWRITE THIS ORDER CENTERING AND PRIORITIZING
THE FAMILIES WHO NEED AFTER SCHOOL THE MOST. PUTTING IN THEIR
HANDS AND ASKING THEM FOR INPUT AND FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT THEY
NEED FOR TRANSPORTATION, LANGUAGE ACCESS, AND OTHER EQUITY ISSUES
WE EXPERIENCE. I CALL ON THE COUNCIL TO REWRITE THIS ORDER AND
REALLY AUTHENTICALLY CENTER ANTIRACISM AND EQUITY BASED ON WHAT
THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST ASK FOR. THANK YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> THANK YOU. JACKSON PLACE. JEFFERSON PARK IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE.
ON 689 MASS AVENUE, THAT'S THE HISTORIC SAVINGS BANK BUILDING, THE
CORNER OF TEMPLE STREET, ADJACENT TO THE GASLIGHT BUILDING. AND
OVER 100 RESIDENTS OF CAMBRIDGE SIGNED A PETITION TO HAVE BOTH
BUILDINGS LANDMARK, CONSIDERED FOR LANDMARKED DESIGNATION.
WHICH ENTAILS A STUDY BY HISTORICAL COMMISSION STAFF. AND MR.
SULLIVAN IN HIS WISDOM, INTRODUCED A SEPARATION OF THE TWO
BUILDINGS. THEY WERE TO BE TREATED AS SEPARATE AT THE HEARING. ON
WHETHER TO DO A LANDMARK DESIGNATION STUDY AND THE COMMISSION
REJECTED A LANDMARK DESIGNATION STUDY FOR 689 MASS AVENUE.
AGREED TO AUTHORIZED ONE FOR THE GASLIGHT BUILDING. I DON'T KNOW
WHY THAT HAPPENED. I THINK BOTH BUILDINGS ARE IMPORTANT AND BOTH
CONSIDERED CONTRIBUTING BUILDING IN THE REGISTER DISTRICT. FOR
SOME REASON, THE BUILDING, WHICH IS OWNED BY THE UNITARIAN
UNIVERSALIST COMMITTEE, WAS SEPARATED OUT AND NOT INCLUDED FOR A
LANDMARK DESIGNATION STUDY. I THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE. IN ANY CASE, I
THINK THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW THAT THE OWNERS OF THE GASLIGHT
BUILDING HAVE MOVED VERY QUICKLY TO COME BACK TO THE HISTORICAL
COMMISSION ON THE FIRST THURSDAY OF OCTOBER TO PUSH THROUGH
THEIR PLAN THEY HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN APPROVAL FOR FROM THE
PLANNING BOARD FOR A BOUTIQUE HOTEL ON TOP OF THIS VERY
IMPORTANT HISTORIC BUILDING.
I WANT TO ALERT THE PUBLIC, AT LEAST THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO
PROTECT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LANDMARK BUILDINGS IN
CAMBRIDGE NEXT MONTH AT THE FIRST AT THE MEETING OF THE
CAMBRIDGE HISTORICAL COMMISSION. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT RINDGE
AVENUE. TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MEETING FOR OVER A YEAR
WITH PEOPLE FROM IQHQ. FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND AND THE ALEWIFE
STUDY GROUP. NOT TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE
MEETINGS. NO PUN INTENDED, THE MEETINGS HAVE REPORTEDLY GOING
SWIMMINGLY. AND THERE WAS SORT OF CONSENSUS DEVELOPING AND AT
THE LAST MINUTE, AS IS TOO OFTEN THE CASE, CITY ADMINISTRATION, CITY
STAFF, INTRODUCED A TWO WAY BIKE LANE THAT INVOLVE REMOVING THE
EXISTING SIDEWALK. THE PROBLEM WITH THE TWO LANE BIKE LANE, IT IS
BEING MISLABELLED A MULTIUSE PATH. ANYBODY WHO USES THE SO CALLED
MULTIUSE PATH IN THE AREA, WHEN BICYCLISTS RACE THROUGH THEM, THEY
ARE NOT MULTIUSE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS FOR THE TESTIMONY. PETER VALENTINE, YOU
ARE NEXT. PRESS THAT BUTTON.
>> PETER VALENTINE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASE PUT ON YOUR MASK. MASKS ARE REQUIRED.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE.
>> CAMBRIDGE IS A CITY THAT CONSIDERS KNOWLEDGE SACRED. IT SAVED
MY LIFE. I WILL DEFEND IT FOR EVERYONE PERFECTLY FOREVER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SAGE CORBONE.
>> SAGE HAS NOT JOINED THE ZOOM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM?
>> THAT'S ALL THAT SIGNED UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. SINCE IT IS 5:55. WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN. AND
MOVE ON WITH THE PROGRAM. SO, WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUBMISSION OF
THE RECORD. THERE'S NO COMMUNICATIONS. SO WE'LL MOVE TO THE CITY
MANAGER'S AGENDA. AND PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: WE'LL PULL NUMBER ONE OR DID YOU PULL THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL PULL NUMBER ONE. ANY OTHERS?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: NUMBER THREE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE? ROLL CALL ON THE BALANCE.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE BALANCE AND FOR THE RECORD, THE BALANCE
INCLUDES CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 2, 4, AND ON THOSE ITEMS: (ROLL
CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM ONE.
(READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 1). WE'LL HAVE A PRESENTATION
AND A CHANCE FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.
>> CITY MANAGER: GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY. WE'LL PROVIDE THE
COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY WITH THE BIWEEKLY COVID 19 UPDATE.
CAMBRIDGE'S SEVEN DAY MOVING AVERAGE FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER
HUNDRED THOUSAND IS 13.6 CASES TODAY. AND OUR PERCENT OF
POSITIVITY IS POINT 37. AS REPORTED ON SEPTEMBER 23RD, IN THE
COMMONWEALTH WEEKLY REPORT. THIS IS DOWN FROM THE POINT 3 I
REPORTED ON SEPTEMBER SIX. THE SEVEN DAY AVERAGE PERCENT
POSITIVITY IS 1.87 PERCENT. I'M GOING TO ASK SUE TO READ THIS FOR A
SECOND AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY TO DO THIS. WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS
BACK ON PUBLIC COMMENT. I WANT TO GO TO THAT PERSON AND WE CAN
CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS PERSON WAITING. SAGE?
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. HI, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY
COMMENT. I'M SAGE, 273RD STREET... AND I'M EMPLOYEE OF THE
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND I WANTED TO APPLAUD THE COUNCIL FOR
BRINGING PARENTS CONCERN TO THIS FORUM. AND I FIRST WANT TO POINT
OUT THAT THIS ORDER WAS NOT COMMUNICATED TO STAFF MEMBERS BY
LEADERSHIP IN HUMAN SERVICES. IF IT HAD, MOST STAFF COULDN'T
PARTICIPATE BECAUSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING DOESN'T END UNTIL

6:00. THIS POINT, A CENTRAL ISSUE OF THE RIFT BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION
AND STAFF AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE SAME
GOAL TO SERVE EVERY CHILD IN CAMBRIDGE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE LEADERSHIP AT DHSP, NOT JUST
CREATING THESE REPORTS, BUT ALSO JUSTIFYING THE REASON WHY WE
NEEDED TO BEGIN THIS NEW PROCESS IN A PANDEMIC WITHOUT PARENT
INPUT AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. AND I THINK I WAS INFORMED BY
NAOMI THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO RAISED THEIR HAND IN
THE ZOOM. WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND WASN'T SIGN SIDE UP. WE'LL
FOLLOW UP WITH THEM VIA EMAIL. WITH THAT, BACK TO THE
PRESENTATION. THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. WE'LL START OFF WITH 76% OF CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE AND 69% ARE
FULLY VACCINATED. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S COVID WEEKLY
MUNICIPALITY VACCINATION REPORT PUBLISHED ON SEPTEMBER 23RD.
THE COVID 19 METRICS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE CITY'S DATA CENTER. AND
THE CITY WILL OFFER COVID 19 TESTS FOUR DAYS A WEEK IN OCTOBER. AND
OUR TESTING OCCURS AT CAMBRIDGESIDE GALLERIA TWO DAYS A WEEK, 50
CHURCH STREET IN HARVARD SQUARE, AND ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. AND
TESTING SITE'S CAMBRIDGESIDE WILL BE A DRIVE THROUGH TESTING SITE ON
OCTOBER 4, 50 CHURCH AND ST. JOHN WILL HAVE WALK IN SITES.
CAMBRIDGESIDE IS RETURNING TO DRIVE THROUGH BECAUSE THE INDOOR
SPACE NEEDS TO BE PREPARED FOR A NEW TENANT. THEY HAVE BEEN VERY
GENEROUS TO THE COMMUNITY TO ALLOW US TO USE THE SPACES AS WELL
AS WE HEAD INTO THE FALL, I THANK THEM FOR PARTNERING WITH US.
WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR OUR TESTING PROGRAM. IF NEEDED,
WE'LL EXPLORE ADDING A FIFTH DAY OF TESTING. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION
FROM ST. PAUL'S, IF NEEDED, WE CAN UTILIZE COMMUNITY LIFE CENTER FOR
TESTING. AND ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE EXPLORING OPTIONS TO HIRE AN
OUTSIDE FIRM TO STAFF ADDITIONAL TESTING SITES WE ADD. AND THE SITES
ARE LABOR INTENSIVE AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL NEED STAFFING RESOURCES
FOR THE FULL VACCINATION PROGRAM. AND I WANT TO THANK THE
CAMBRIDGE FIRE, PRO EMS, WHO HAVE STAFFED THE SITE SINCE WE BEGAN.
THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN A MAJOR STAFFING STRAIN AND SEEKING OUTSIDE
ASSISTANCE FOR ADDITIONAL TESTING SITES WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR THE
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE WE DO NOT BURN OUT THE
INTERNAL TESTING CREWS.
INFORMATION ABOUT COVID 19 TESTING PROGRAMMING INCLUDING HOURS
ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE. IN ADDITION TO THE CITY'S TESTING SITES,
RESIDENTS CAN FIND OTHER OPTIONS BY VISITING ONLINE.
THIS SITE LET YOU SEARCH FOR TEST BY ZIP CODE AND GIVES SUPERVISE
INFORMATION ABOUT AT HOME COVID 19 TESTS THAT CAN BE ORDERED
ONLINE. I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE EVICTION ACTIVITY IN THE
CITY. WE ARE LOOKING AT LEGAL OPTIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS


PAGE 17

Sept. 27, 2021

AVAILABLE TO US.
AS YOU KNOW, THE CITY'S TEMPORARY EVICTION MORATORIUM ENDED IN
JUNE OF 2021. THE COMMONWEALTH STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS LIFTED.
THE CITY'S DECLARATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WAS ALSO
RESCINDED AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED THE EVICTION MORATORIUM
COULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A CHALLENGE BASED ON THE SUPREME COURT
DECISION. MY TEAM IS COMMITTED TO EXPLORING ALL LEGAL OPTIONS
AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESIDENTS. WE STILL NOT HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT
RISE IN THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL FILINGS IN CAMBRIDGE FOR
NONPAYMENT. WE ATTRIBUTE THESE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS AND IS AVAILABLE
FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND STATE. THE CITY HAS
OFFERED RESIDENTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SINCE THE START OF THE
PANDEMIC, BEGINNING IN MARCH OF 2020, THROUGH WHICH OVER 1,400
RECEIVED RENTAL ASSISTANCE TOTALLING OVER $3 MILLION. THE CITY
CONTINUES TO OFFER FUNDS THROUGH THE HOUSING STABILIZATION FUND
AND THAT HAS COMMITTED MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS TO
APPROXIMATELY $300 HOUSEHOLDS. THE CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY
HAS IMPLEMENTED A TENANCY PREVENTION PROGRAM, IT HAS OUTREACH
AND ASSISTANCE AND ASSESSING RESOURCES AND RESULTED IN A VERY FEW
COURT FILINGS.
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE
STATE, RAFT, AND OTHERS, ALL THREE CAN ASSIST TENANTS. ALLOWS
LANDLORDS TO REQUEST FUNDS ON BEHALF OF TENANTS. AND MANY
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS AND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HAVE
WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY AND TENANTS TO ENSURE THEY
ARE AWARE AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM.
AS YOU KNOW, THE HOUSING LIAISON MONITOR THE COURT FILINGS
WEEKLY. STAFF REACH OUT TO ALL TENANTS ON THE DOCKET TO OFFER
ASSISTANCE AND THE LIAISON IN THE MULTISERVICE CENTER MEET
REGULARLY WITH PARTNERS.
OUR TENANTS RIGHT AND RESOURCE NOTIFICATION PROVIDE RESOURCES
CREATED BY THE CITY AND GIVEN TO TENANTS ALONG WITH ANY EVICTION
NOTICE, INCLUDING NOTICE TO QUIT. AND THE CITY HOUSED IN CAMBRIDGE
AND INTO THE CITY WIDE INFORMATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN HAS
BEEN OFFERED WEBINARS AND INTERACTIVE STORY MAP AND OTHER
MATERIALS AND RESOURCE TO ASSIST RESIDENTS WITH ASSESSING HOUSING
AND RELATED ASSISTANCE. AS I HAVE EXPLAINED, WE HAVE FINANCIAL
RESOURCES IN PLACE TO ASSIST RESIDENTS. I WANT TO THANK MAURA AND
MARIA AND THE STAFF FOR THE WORK TO MONITOR EVICTIONS AND
ATTEMPT TO ASSIST THE RESIDENTS. THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC HAS BEEN
DIFFICULT ON ALL OF US, CERTAIN BUSINESS SECTORS HAVE BEEN HIT
HARDER AND THE LOCAL RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IS ONE OF SUCH THAT
HAD ISSUES. SINCE MARCH OF 2020, OUR RESTAURANT COMMUNITY HAS
BEEN AMAZING PARTNERS WITH THE CITY DURING THE PANDEMIC'S
RESPONSE AND WITHOUT HESITATION WORKS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE


PAGE 18

Sept. 27, 2021

WITH COVID GUIDELINES. THEY DEMONSTRATED PERSEVERANCE AND
EVOLVE WITH CONSUMER ENVIRONMENTS. THE CITY HAS PROVIDED
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL INTERVENTIONS TO ASSIST THIS VITAL
INDUSTRY, WHICH WAS HIT HARD WITH DIVIDE CAPACITY RESTRICTIONS. THE
RESTAURANTS NEED OUR SUPPORT AND COMMITTED TO FURTHER OUR
EFFORTS TO ANALYZE AND IDENTIFYING NEW WAYS TO ASSIST THE
RESTAURANT COMMUNITY.
AFTER SEVERAL PRODUCTIVE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MEETINGS, OUR
TEAM PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TOGETHER TO OFFER RESTAURANTS AN
EXTENSION TO THE CURRENT TEMPORARY OUTDOOR PATIO LICENSE, WHICH
ARE DUE TO EXPIRE ON JANUARY 1. THIS EXTENSION WILL GO THROUGH THE
WINTER UNTIL APRIL 1, WHICH IS WHEN THE STATE EXTENSION EXPIRES. THE
EXTENSION IN THE PUBLIC WAY, USE THE AREA THROUGH THE WINTER
MONTH, HAVE TO BE REMOVED BY TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT, PUBLIC WORKS
AND LICENSE COMMISSION. THE RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T WANT ABILITY
TO KEEP THE PATIO OPEN DUE TO LACK OF SPACE, THE CITY WILL CONTINUE
TO WORK WITH RESTAURANTS TO ACCOMMODATE AS BEST WE CAN. AND
THE LICENSE COMMISSION WILL BE COMMUNICATING WITH ALL LICENSE
ESTABLISHMENTS LATER THIS WEEK, WALKING THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS IN
THE PROCESS. IN ADDITION, IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, PART OF THE 2022
LICENSE RENEWAL, THE CITY WILL RELEASE UPDATED DETAIL REGULATIONS
AND GUIDELINES FOR THE ANNUAL OUTDOOR DINING PROGRAM EFFECTIVE
SPRING OF 2022.
I WANT TO THANK THE CITY'S MULTIDEPARTMENTAL TEAM WHO IS WORKING
AROUND THE CLOCK TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN IN A TIMELY MANNER.
INCLUDING THE LICENSE COMMISSION, THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT, PUBLIC
WORKS, LAW, FIRE, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, INSPECTIONAL SERVICES,
AND THE MANAGER'S OFFICE. WE PUT OUT TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE
WEBSITE. PROVIDE ACCESS TO DATA AND SHARE INFORMATION DAILY WITH
THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE EMAIL UPDATES. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO
SHARING INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND WITH THE COUNCIL IN THE
WEEKLY DIGEST.
AS WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC, WE MONITOR DATA
COMING FROM THE COMMONWEALTH AND WORK WITH CITY
DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO
ENSURE THAT WE SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE
COMMUNITY. AND AS WITH EACH PREVIOUS DECISION MADE, I WILL WORK
CLOSELY WITH MY TEAM AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, THE
STATE, AND THE REGIONAL PARTNERS. AT THIS TIME, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO
SUE. THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. IT IS ON?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS.
>> THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. I'M GOING TO REVIEW
THE LATEST INFORMATION WE HAVE ON COVID FOR THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE. IF I CAN HAVE THE SLIDES, PLEASE.


PAGE 19

Sept. 27, 2021

OKAY. SO, HERE WE HAVE A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT IS GOING ON. ACTUALLY,
WE DO HAVE AN UPDATE FROM TODAY. MOST OF WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE
IS AS OF SEPTEMBER 26TH. 7354 TOTAL CASES, PROBABLE, CONFIRMED, AND
SUSPECT. 7050 IN THE COMMUNITY. AND 304 CASES IN LONG TERM CARE
FACILITIES. THERE HAVE BEEN 124 DEATHS, 61% OF THE DEATHS WERE
AMONG LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS. AND THERE ARE 345 CASES ACTIVE.
AND WE HAVE A 13.6 CONFIRMED CASES PER 100,000 FOR A SEVEN DAY
AVERAGE SEPTEMBER 19 25. WE HAVE A TEST POSITIVITY RATE OF .37%
ENDING SEPTEMBER 18. NEXT SLIDE.
THIS IS THE SLIDE AS OF TODAY. WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE CAMBRIDGE
CASES BY RISK CATEGORIES. SO THIS IS WHAT WE LOOK AT WHEN WE TALK
ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR MITIGATING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING MASK
WEARING. AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS HERE, EVEN THOUGH WE DID HAVE
THAT SPIKE IN SEPTEMBER THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDENTS
RETURNING TO COLLEGE, MAYBE WITH A LITTLE LUCK, WE MAY ON A
DOWNWARD TREND IN THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. COMMUNITY TESTING IN CAMBRIDGE. THE CITY IS
OFFERING COVID TESTING FOUR DAYS A WEEK. AND FOUR HOUR SESSIONS,
STARTING OCTOBER 4, THE CAMBRIDGESIDE WILL OFFER DRIVE THROUGH
ONLY. THROUGH SEPTEMBER 1 AND 19, 8207 TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED.
YOU CAN HAVE TESTS AT LOCAL PHARMACIES AND OTHER SITES. FOR MORE
INFORMATION, CAN YOU GO TO THE WEBSITE.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE. THIS
IS THE DATE FOR THE UPCOMING FLU CENTERS. THEY WILL BE HELD
THROUGHOUT THE CITY IN OCTOBER. OCTOBER 15 AT THE SENIOR CENTER,
OCTOBER 16, AT KING OPEN SCHOOL, OCTOBER 22, RESERVOIR CHURCH, AND
OCTOBER 23, PISANI CENTER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
BOOSTER SHOTS WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE FOR ADULTS WHO RECEIVED BOTH
DOSES OF PFIZER VACCINE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AGO. THE CRITERIA FOR
PEOPLE THAT ARE AGE 65 OR OLDER. HAVE AN UNDERLYING HEALTH
CONDITION. WORK OR LIVE IN A HIGH EXPOSURE SETTING. RIGHT NOW, 69%
ARE FULLY VACCINATED IN CAMBRIDGE. AND 76% CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS
HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. THAT TRANSLATES INTO 76,838
RESIDENTS BEING FULLY VACCINATED. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
HERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF OUR VACCINATION AND RACE ETHNICITY DATA. I
THINK YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IT. IT HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH. IF AT ALL,
SINCE THE LAST TIME WE LOOKED AT THE SLIDE. WE ARE DOING BETTER OR
EQUAL TO THE MASSACHUSETTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MULTIRACIAL. I
THINK THAT IS JUST BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR CATEGORY IS COLLECTED IN
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. SO IT IS REALLY HARD TO TELL WHAT THAT NUMBER
MEANS AND HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AGAIN, HERE'S THE VACCINATION BY AGE AND GENDER.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO DO IN THE 16
19 YEAR OLD BRACKET. I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE
VACCINATE OFFERING VACCINES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL STARTING IN


PAGE 20

Sept. 27, 2021

OCTOBER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THIS IS WHERE I'M JUST SORT OF GOING TO TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO TO
SPEAK OFF THE CUFF. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS FOR A REALLY
LONG TIME AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF NUMBERS OVER
THE LAST ALMOST TWO YEARS. CLAUDE WOULD SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT
MANY NUMBERS, EMAILS, AND THE LIKE. I WILL GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF
BEHIND THE NUMBERS. THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WE
HAVE A NUMBER OF DIVISIONS. IT IS JUST NOT NURSING AND
EPIDEMIOLOGY. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE
EVERYBODY ELSE, WHICH IS ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT, WHO
HAS HELPED PULL THE NUMBERS TOGETHER. SO, THE ADMIN AND FRONT
STAFF, THEY HAVE WORKED IN SCHOOLS TO HELP WITH THE WORK GOING ON
IN SCHOOLS.
HEEL, OUR HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE PROGRAM. THEY HAVE DONE
THINGS LIKE HELP WITH FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND COORDINATE RESOURCES
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE. THEY ALSO HAVE
TRAINED AND TRANSCRIBE VOICEMAIL AND ANSWER EMAILS THAT ARE NOT
CLINICALLY COMPLICATED.
OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TEAM HAS ALSO PROVIDED
ASSISTANCE IN CLINICS, DONE EMAIL TRIAGE AND HAVE TRANSCRIBED PHONE
CALLS THAT COME IN FROM WORRIED RESIDENTS. MEN'S HEALTH LEAGUE,
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE C 3 AMBASSADORS THAT GO OUT
AND HELP KNOCK ON DOORS AND GET INFORMATION OUT AND RECRUIT FOR
PEOPLE TO COME AND GET VACCINATED.
AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THAT. THIS IS ALL CROSS TRAINING. PEOPLE
WORKING OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCOPE. WHAT THEY WERE HIRED FOR.
WORKING AT TIMES WHEN THEY REALLY WANTED TO BE HOME WITH THEIR
FAMILIES OR PARTNERS OR BE HOME IN TIME FOR DINNER. AND WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE 2,500 EMAILS TRIAGED. 3,400 COVID TEST
RESULTS GIVEN TO PEOPLE, NOT BY CLINICAL PEOPLE. AND AGAIN,
THOUSANDS OF TRANSCRIBED VOICEMAILS. AGAIN, TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN
THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WHO ARE NOT TRAINED TO BE CLINICIANS
OR TO BE EPIDEMIOLOGIES, WE COULDN'T EPIDEMIOLOGISTS, WE
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE TEAM, CAMBRIDGE
PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH SOMEONE WHEN YOU CAN
RECOGNIZE PEOPLE BEHIND THE PHOTOS. MARY AND ANNA, SHUTOUT TO
THEM. IT IS AN HONOR FOR MY OFFICE TO WORK WITH THE TEAM AND SEE
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN DOING. REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. WE'LL
MOVE TO QUESTIONS FROM THE BODY. WE'LL START. I SEE WE'LL GO TO
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, WHO HAS HIS HAND UP. AND THEN WE'LL
GO TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT
PRESENTATION. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE TESTING
SWITCHING TO DRIVE THROUGH ONLY. I HAVE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF SITES


PAGE 21

Sept. 27, 2021

AND THEY HAVE A DRIVE UP OR BIKE UP COMPONENT. IS THERE A REASON
THAT THE CAMBRIDGESIDE IS DRIVE UP ONLY. IS THERE A WAY TO INCLUDE
THAT, A WALK UP COMPONENT TO THAT?
>> CITY MANAGER: SO, WE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT WALK UP AND
BICYCLING, DUE TO SAFETY REASONS AND THE WAY THE GARAGE IS SET UP,
THEY FELT LIKE IT WASN'T A SAFE WAY TO DO THINGS. WE ASKED THEM TO
LOOK AT IT AGAIN AND THEY CONTINUE TO SAY DUE TO THE WAY IT IS SET UP
AND THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME, WE'D HAVE THE OTHER TWO SITES
AVAILABLE. THEY RECOMMEND NOT TO HAVE THAT AS A POSSIBILITY AND
THAT'S ALSO A REASON WHY WE LOOK AT THE FIFTH SITE TO MAKE IT
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. THAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION OF BOTH FIRE AND
PRO AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS TO NOT HAVE THAT FOR SAFETY
REASONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL DETAIL IS
HELPFUL. IF WE CAN DO AN ADDITIONAL WALK UP, BIKE UP SITE, ON THE
EASTERN SIDE OF THE CITY, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T
HAVE A CAR, CAN'T AFFORD A CAR, LIMITING TESTING SITES THAT ARE
AVAILABLE, IF WE CAN ADD THE ADDITIONAL ONE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I
YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THAT WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF
MY QUESTION AS WELL. A FOLLOW UP. WAS THERE SOMETHING NOT I
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE WALKING UP THE
RAMP IN THE GARAGE TO GET TO THE TESTING SITE. THAT'S NOT HOW THE
TESTING SITE WAS WORKING BEFORE. IT WAS IN A STOREFRONT IN THE
MALL. IT WAS SAFE. WHY IS THAT NO LONGER
>> CITY MANAGER: WE NO LONGER HAVE THE SPACE. IT IS STRAIGHT FROM
THE GARAGE. WITH THE GARAGE ALONE, THEY FELT UNCOMFORTABLE
DOING IT UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. WE LOST THE INSIDE TESTING SITE
AND GOING INTO THE GARAGE.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I CAN UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T WANT
PEOPLE WALKING UP THE RAMPS. IT IS NOT LIKE SADLY, NOT LIKE EVERY
STOREFRONT IN THE MALL IS FULL. AT LEAST THE LAST TIME I WAS THERE. I
WAS CURIOUS AS TO WHY WE COULDN'T MAINTAIN THE SPACE INSIDE.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT DOING TWO.
DRIVE THROUGH AND INTERNAL SPACE BECAUSE OF STAFFING ISSUES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: TO FOLLOW UP, IF WE DO A FIFTH SITE, GIVEN
THE OTHER SITES ARE WALK UP SITES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, I HOPE
THAT SITE IS LOCATED IN EAST CAMBRIDGE SOMEWHERE TO ALLOW FOLKS
FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TO MORE EASILY ACCESS TESTING.
>> CITY MANAGER: I'D SAY, I DON'T DISAGREE. RIGHT NOW, IF WE GO TO
THE FIFTH SITE, IT LOOKS TO BE ST. PAUL'S. WE CAN SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I DO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF. I WAS
TESTED LAST WEEK. AT THE CHURCH. IT WAS INCREDIBLY AND EFFICIENT.
EVERYBODY WAS VERY POLITE, RESPECTFUL, AND MOVED PEOPLE ALONG.

Sept. 27, 2021

VERY PROFESSIONALLY AND SWIFTLY. FOR FOLKS THAT LISTEN, IT IS VERY
EASY. IT IS VERY EASY AND QUICK. AND THE STAFF IS WONDERFUL. I WANT
TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AS MANY SITES AS WE CAN OPEN, THE BETTER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. A RECENT COLLEAGUE... THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I ASK A QUESTION. A RECENT COLLEAGUE CAME
DOWN WITH COVID. AND MY QUESTION IS... THEY HAD A VACCINE, TWO
SHOTS. WHAT IS THE NORMAL WAIT TIME AFTER THAT BEFORE THEY CAN
ENTER THE PUBLIC WORLD AGAIN? IS THERE AN AMOUNT OF DAYS? AN
AMOUNT OF DAYS, IF THERE ARE NOT BAD SYMPTOMS, EVERYTHING IS FINE?
>> YES. AFTER YOUR LAST SHOT, WAIT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE
ASSUMING THAT YOUR IMMUNITY KICKED IN.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THIS PERSON HAD TWO SHOTS. IT IS MONTHS
SINCE THAT. THEY CAME DOWN WITH COVID NEVERTHELESS. THE ENTRY
BACK INTO PUBLIC LIFE, IS IT A TWO WEEK PERIOD?
>> WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT REALLY IS BREAKTHROUGH COVID.
THERE'S NO TIME FRAME FOR THAT. THAT COULD HAPPEN AT ANYTIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE QUESTION YOU ARE ASKING, YOU TEST POSITIVE,
HOW MANY DAYS YOU SHOULD ARE YOU ASKING QUARANTINE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> OKAY. YOU TEST POSITIVE, EVEN WITH BREAKTHROUGH, IT IS THE SAME
AS IF YOU HAD NOT HAD A VACCINE. ALL THE SAME CRITERIA TO STAY IN AND
YOU WOULD BE FOLLOWED UP BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THEY
WOULD GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: NO SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD. IT IS INDIVIDUAL.
DEPENDS ON EACH PERSON?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK IT IS TEN DAYS.
>> THERE IS. SAME AS IF YOU HAD GOTTEN COVID WITHOUT A VACCINE. TEN
DAYS. SORRY. I MISUNDERSTOOD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. IT WASN'T CLEAR.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR
NOLAN, AND THEN VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY
WE ARE NOT DOING VACCINATION AT CRLS UNTIL OCTOBER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OCTOBER IS IN A FEW DAYS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THAT'S TRUE. WHY AREN'T WE DOING IT
RIGHT NOW?
>> BECAUSE SCHOOL NEEDED TO OPEN AND GET SETTLED DOWN. AND
STAFF ING. AND WHEN THE NURSES ARE DOING IT AT THE SCHOOL, IT IS NOT


PAGE 23

Sept. 27, 2021

A STAND ALONE CLINIC WITH THE TOTAL ENTOURAGE THAT WE NORMALLY
HAVE. WE ARE STARTING THE REGULAR CITY WIDE CLINICS, SO THERE HAVE
BEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST WHERE THE NURSES THEMSELVES
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THAT WORK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, WITH THE HELP OF
ONE OR TWO OTHER SCHOOL NURSES, HAVE BEEN ABLE TO VACCINATE
WITHOUT BRINGING IN POLICE, FIRE, AND 14 NURSES. THE SCHOOL NURSES
NEED TO GET IN, SETTLE DOWN, REVIEW MEDICAL RECORDS, DO EVERYTHING
THEY DO TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE READY TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS FOR
THE SEASON. THE FIRST THING ON THE AGENDA IS TO BEGIN VACCINATING,
WHICH IS WHY IT IS HAPPENING IN EARLY OCTOBER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: GOT IT. THANK YOU. MY SAME QUESTION IS
ON THE VACCINE MANDATE. IF THERE IS ANY UPDATE OR NEWS ON THAT?
>> CITY MANAGER: WE HAVE SENT OUT OUR FIRST EMAIL TO THE UNIONS
AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THE FACT WE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS. WE MET
AGAIN ON IT TODAY, TO BE HONEST. WE DO NOT HAVE A MANDATE OR A
PLAN FINALIZED TO SAY WE WOULD OR WOULD NOT ASK THEM TO BE
VACCINATED. IT WOULD BE VACCINATION/TESTING, WE ARE IN DISCUSSION
NOW. WE'LL MEET AGAIN NEXT WEEK TO COME UP WITH DETAILS OF
IMPLEMENTATION ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED. WE HAVE REACHED OUT
TO OTHER CITIES TO FIND TO AFFIRM THE COMPLICATIONS THAT
EVERYBODY IS HAVING. WE ARE STILL MOVING FORWARD. IF WE DECIDE TO
DO IT, HOW WE'LL GO ABOUT ACTUALLY DOING THESE TESTS. WHEN TO
MAKE THEM AVAILABLE. I THINK WE'LL HAVE THAT INFORMATION IN THE
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT HOW WE
WANT TO HANDLE IT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TOLD THE UNIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME I'M HAVING
A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING SOME PEOPLE. IF I SPEAK CLOSELY YOU CAN.
IF WE CAN ALL DO THAT, THAT IS GREAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON
THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY. SOMEONE IS UNMUTED AND WE ARE
HEARING YOU. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I DO HOPE AND ITERATE WE GET TO
100% STAFF VACCINATION. I KNOW AND A LOT OF CITIES ARE TRYING TO
FIGURE IT OUT. I STILL STAND BEHIND THE POLICY ORDER WE PASSED IN THIS
BODY SAYING 100% STAFF VACCINATIONS, NOT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF
TESTING. WHICH MANY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. I WENT INTO A CAMBRIDGE
ENTITY AND HI TO BRING MY VACCINATION CARD. IT IS OUT THERE AND LET'S
DO WHAT WE CAN. MY QUESTION IS TO FOLLOW UP ON THE VERY EXCITING
NEWS AND THE HIGH SCHOOL VACCINATION WILL BE THERE.
I DO HOPE THAT WE MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY. I HAVE A QUESTION RELATED
TO IT. A FEW DAYS AGO, I TALKED TO A PARENT OF A HIGH SCHOOLER, WHO


PAGE 24

Sept. 27, 2021

BELIEVES THAT ONLY HALF OF THE STUDENTS AT CRLS ARE VACCINATED. AND
THIS PARENT WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND SAID WE NEED TO
DO MORE. SHE WAS QUITE WORRIED FOR HER CHILD TO BE IN THE ROOM. I
LOOK AT STATISTICS, 12 15 YEAR OLDS, 83% OF THE 12 15 YEAR OLDS ARE
FULLY VACCINATED. AND 40% 16 19, IT SEEMS LIKE THE NUMBERS WOULD BE
HIGHER. THE QUESTION IS, IF IT IS MORE THAN 50%, PLEASE LET'S
COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE COMMUNITY SO THAT FAMILIES AND PARENTS
ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT A VERY LOW VACCINATION RATE. AND CAN WE
USE THIS OPPORTUNITY, WHEN WE VACCINATE, I HAVE SEEN THE FIRE TRUCK,
WE HAD THE FIRE FIGHTERS VACCINATING PEOPLE IN HARVARD SQUARE, IT
WAS INCREDIBLE SITE TO SEE THIS TRUCK WITH FULL STAFF HEALTHCARE
WORKERS, HAVE IT A DAILY EVENT, DO WHAT IT TAKES, $25 GIFT CARD TO
STUDENTS OR TO FAMILY, USE THE VIDEO ON THE WEBSITE ABOUT CHA. A
DIVERSE GROUP. OVERCOMING VACCINE HESITANCY. I'M CURIOUS IF WE
CAN DO THAT LEVEL OF OUTREACH OF INDIVIDUAL PERSUADING,
EDUCATION, SO WE CAN GET THE VACCINATION RATES UP FAR HIGHER IN
THE AGE GROUP. AND PROVIDE IT FOR THE RANGE OF FAMILIES THAT LIKELY
ARE HOME AND NOT VACCINATED.
>> THE EFFORT IS TO BRING THE VACCINE TO THE KIDS. THAT'S ONE THING
WE'LL DO. AND WE WANT TO DO IT SO THEY DON'T MISS SCHOOL. HAVING
GIVEN A NUMBER OF VACCINE CLINICS IN THE SCHOOL, SO IT DOESN'T
INTERRUPT SCHOOL TIME, ESPECIALLY FOR HIGH SCHOOL, TO ROLL IT OUT
AND HAVE THEM COME DOWN AND SEE THE NURSE BY APPOINTMENT OR
SMALL GROUPS. WE ARE ALSO DOING OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN, AT THE
SAME TIME, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DOING OUR FAMILY FLU CLINICS,
WHERE WE'LL GIVE OUT COVID VACCINE AS WELL. AND WE'LL BE
ENCOURAGING FAMILIES TO GO THERE AS WELL AS ANOTHER OPTION.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: GREAT. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, WE'LL DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE SCHOOL. I WAS SUGGESTING 3:00, THAT'S
WHEN HIGH SCHOOL SENDS. MAKE IT AN EVENT AND GET PEOPLE. FLU
CLINICS WILL ALSO INCLUDE COVID VACCINES? GREAT. IF I GO TO THE
CHELSEA WEBSITE, THEY HAVE VACCINATION CLINICS AT THEIR SENIOR
CENTERS. YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR OUR WEBSITE, YOU GO AND CLICK
THROUGH TO MASS... LET'S DO A BETTER JOB ON OUR WEBSITE OF HAVING
IT VERY CLEAR WE PROVIDE THE CLINICS. IT WILL NOT BE JUST FLU, BUT
VACCINE. PROVIDE IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES, TO CLICK ON IT AND
UNDERSTAND, DEPENDING ON YOUR BACKGROUND.
>> I HEAR YOU. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE, THE CLINICS YOU SAW
ON THE SCREEN THAT ARE PUBLICIZED, ARE FOR THE PUBLIC. WHAT YOU
DIDN'T SEE ON THE SCREEN, ARE THE WHAT WE CALL THE NON PUBLIC
CLINICS FOR FRAGILE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. HOMELESS
SHELTERS, MEAL PROGRAMS, SENIOR HOUSING. THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE BIG GIANT PUBLIC VACCINE. IT IS NOT JUST FOUR, IT IS MANY MORE.
THE ONES WE ENCOURAGE AND PROMOTE FAMILIES, FAMILIES WITH THAT
DIFFICULT AGE GROUP TO GO TO, IT IS THE LARGE VACCINATION CLINICS.


PAGE 25

Sept. 27, 2021

>> CITY MANAGER: I APPRECIATE WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE DOING. I BELIEVE
IN TESTING AND IN VACCINE IS A PERCENTAGE, THERE IS NOBODY AHEAD OF
US. WE CAN CONFIRM THAT, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE WE'RE
NOT DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. I THINK WE ARE THE LEADER IN FINDING
WAYS TO MAKE VACCINES AND TESTING AVAILABLE IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THAT MAY BE, WHEN I DID THE
COMPARISON ON THE WEBSITE, IT IS NOT AS OBVIOUS. I BELIEVE IN TESTING,
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. ON THE VACCINE, FOR ME, I HEARD THE
CHELSEA WAS GOING DOOR TO DOOR, THEY ARE ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT
AND SUCCESSFUL AT GETTING THE VACCINATION RATE UP. THAT'S WHY I
LOOK TO THEM AS THE MODEL. AND HERE YOU GO AND FOR OUR WEBSITE,
IT TOOK ME WHEN HE SAID GET A VACCINE, IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE
SITES IN CAMBRIDGE. I BELIEVE YOU. I THINK MAKE SURE ALL
COMMUNICATION ARE IN SYNC WITH WHAT WE ARE DOING. DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE? OKAY. THANK YOU. I WILL YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO VICE MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION
AND I THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THAT JOYFUL PICTURE OF THE PUBLIC
HEALTH TEAM. I KNOW EVERYBODY IS WORKING FOR A LONG TIME
NONSTOP AND DOES SEEM ENDLESS AND THANKLESS. I APPRECIATE YOU
BRINGING THAT INTO THIS ROOM TONIGHT. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. I DO
WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO SEE THAT 16 19 YEAR OLD DATA
BROKEN OUT BY AGE GROUP. SO WE CAN SEE IT. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING
FOR US TO SEE WHERE THE BIGGEST DROP OFF IS AND HOW TO TARGET.
RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS LIKE 16 19 COULD BE ANYTHING. AND I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE HERE, GOT THEIR VACCINATION
SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND HOW THAT PLAYS INTO ANOTHER STATE, HOW THAT
PLAYS INTO THE NUMBERS. I THINK THERE'S MORE INFORMATION WE CAN
FIND OUT THERE.
FOR THE NEXT COVID UPDATE, MAYBE WE CAN HAVE MORE INFORMATION IN
THAT AGE GROUP. SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE. SORRY.
>> IT IS WORSE THAN MUTE ON THE COMPUTER. TO VICE MAYOR MALLON, I
DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET ANNA ON THE SCREEN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANNA CAN SPEAK.
>> I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND SHE MAY HAVE
INFORMATION FOR YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET HER HERE FOR YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANNA, WE CAN UNMUTE YOU TO GO AHEAD.
>> HI, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ABOUT THE 16
19 YEAR OLD DATA. CURRENTLY, THE SOURCE OF THAT DATA COMES FROM
REPORTS PREPARED BY MASS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR EVERY
MUNICIPALITY. AND SO IT IS GIVEN AN AGGREGATE, 16 19. I CAN LOOK INTO
IT, I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO PULL FROM THE STATE DATABASE BY
INDIVIDUAL YEAR OF AGE. I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME
18 AND 19 YEAR OLDS, PARTICULARLY WHO ARE COUNTED AS CAMBRIDGE


PAGE 26

Sept. 27, 2021

RESIDENTS IN THE CENSUS, MAY HAVE BEEN VACCINATED ELSEWHERE AS
YOU SAID BECAUSE THEY ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS HERE.
AND WHEN WE COMPARE TO OTHER CITIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH THAT
HAVE HIGH COUNTS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKE AMHERST, WE SEE SIMILAR
PATTERNS PLAY OUT. I CAN LOOK INTO BREAKING OUT THE NUMBERS, I
DON'T KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE. AT THIS TIME, WE GET THAT IN AGGREGATE
FROM THE STATE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ANNA. THAT'S REALLY
HELPFUL INFORMATION. IF WE CAN GET THAT, I'D APPRECIATE IT AND THANK
YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION ABOUT SIMILAR UNIVERSITY TYPE CITIES.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT NUMBER, IT LOOKS LIKE OH, MY GOD. ALL OF
THE 16 AND 19 YEAR OLDS ARE NOT VACCINATED. THERE'S A DEEPER STORY
THERE AND I KNOW YOU GET TO THE DATA AND I'M GRATEFUL. I WOULD
LOVE TO BRING IT FORWARD. MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT THE
CAMBRIDGESIDE. I HATE TO BRING IT UP AGAIN. I'M CURIOUS. IS IT
POSSIBLE TO HAVE A WALK UP IN THE GARAGE, NOT USING THE RAMP. YOU
CAN WALK THROUGH TJ MAXX AND WHERE THEY DO THE CHECK IN AND DO A
WALK UP. I'M CURIOUS IF THAT WAS CONSIDERED?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL GO BACK. I HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS
WITH THE FIRE CHIEF AND HIS TEAM ON THIS. WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO
PROBABLY BE THE QUESTIONS AND RIGHTFULLY SO. THEY WERE PRETTY
ADAMANT THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO
REVISITING THE CONVERSATION AND TELLING THEM WHAT WE HEARD
TONIGHT. SEE IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. LIKE I SAID,
WE DID HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT IS THE APPROPRIATE
QUESTION TO BE ASKED. THEY WERE PRETTY STRONGLY SAYING THEY DIDN'T
SUPPORT IT. LET ME GO BACK AND VISIT WITH THEM AND WE'LL GIVE AN
UPDATE AT THE NEXT MEETING.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'D APPRECIATE IT. ONLY BECAUSE AS
SOMEONE WHO DRIVES A CAR, I HAVE FOUR OPTIONS DURING THE WEEK. IF
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE, I WOULD HAVE TWO AND WHEN YOU GET THE
SYMPTOMS, WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE TESTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO
COUNCILLOR CARLONE'S POINT EARLIER, THE TIME TO BE OUT AND AWAY
FROM FOLKS AND NOT SPREADING COVID. I'D APPRECIATE IT IF THAT CAN BE
LOOKED AT AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE COULD BE A WALK UP OPTION, ONE OF
THE DAYS, OR TWO, EVEN IF WE ADD A WALK UP SITE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. I HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS. FIRST, YOU
MENTIONED BOOSTER SHOTS. I'M GETTING A FEW INQUIRIES TO MY OFFICE.
I HAVE SAID, I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE SEEN
AROUND GOING ONLINE, FINDING AN APPOINTMENT, THE SPECIFIC
QUESTION I GET IS, IS CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH GOING TO OFFER BOOSTER
SHOTS.
>> SO, CAMBRIDGE WILL BE OFFERING BOOSTER SHOTS. PEOPLE WHO HAD
TWO DOSES OF PFIZER. IF YOU HAD ANY OTHER VACCINE, YOU WOULD NEED
TO CHECK AND SEE WHAT VACCINE YOU HAD AND BRING THAT


PAGE 27

Sept. 27, 2021

INFORMATION. WE WOULDN'T ANYBODY TO BE TURNED AWAY BECAUSE
THEY HAD A DIFFERENT VACCINE THAN WE CAN GIVE THEM. IT IS A LITTLE BIT
COMPLICATED. YES, WE'LL GIVE BOOSTER SHOTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SORRY IF I MISSED THIS. AT THE SPECIFIC CLINICS
COMING UP, CAN WE SAY IF YOU FIT THAT SPECIFIC CRITERIA, THEY CAN GET
A BOOSTER AT THE SITES?
>> YES. IF THEY COME IN AND HAD TWO DOSES OF PFIZERS. WE HAVE A
PFIZER VACCINE, THEY CAN GET THE BOOSTER. THEY ARE NOT BEING
ADVERTISED AS BOOSTER SHOTS. I MEAN BOOSTER CLINICS. WE ALSO HAVE
A LARGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WE WANT TO GET, BUT IT IS AVAILABLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. EVEN IF WE DON'T ADVERTISE, WE SHOULD
SHARE IT OUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE WHO MAY
NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT APPOINTMENT ON MASS.GOV OR
HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO GO OUT OF CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU FOR
CLARIFYING.
THE SECOND QUESTION I HAD, WE RECEIVED A FEW INQUIRIES AROUND
HALLOWEEN GUIDANCE. AND I KNOW HALLOWEEN IS AT THE END OF THE
MONTH. SINCE WE ARE BIWEEKLY, IF THERE IS GUIDANCE COMING FROM
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT
REACH OUT TO US.
>> OUR TEAM MEETS TWICE A WEEK. IT IS ON THE AGENDA. AND WE WILL
BRING YOU THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AND GET IT ON THE WEBSITE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. THANK YOU. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES
COVERED QUESTIONS AROUND THE TESTING. I HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR
THAT FIFTH SITE. WE HAVE A THREE DAY WEEKEND COMING UP,
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY, I THINK HAVING THAT SITE UP AND RUNNING
SOON WOULD BE IDEAL. I KNOW THAT THE ONE OR TWO CONCERNS I HAD
AROUND THE TESTING HAS BEEN PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT HOW
SMOOTH IT IS AND SO FORTH. I THINK SOME FOLKS HAVE SAID, SPECIFICALLY
THURSDAYS, 3:00 CAN GO TO 6:00, FOR EXAMPLE, TO HELP MORE PEOPLE
GET FROM SCHOOL AND SO FORTH. SEE IF YOU CAN EXTEND THAT TIME.
MOST SITES GO UNTIL 6 OR 8. THAT'S GREAT. EXTENDING THAT THREE FOR A
FEW HOURS COULD ALSO HELP. THAT WAS JUST A SUGGESTION THAT I HAD.
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE. ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES OF MINE? I THINK WE
GOTTEN EVERYBODY. COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. A QUICK NOTE. I'M VERY GLAD TO
HEAR ABOUT THE EXTENSION OF OUTDOOR DINING. MAKE SURE WE DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE FALL AND
WINTER. IT MAY BE THAT WE CAN DO IT LONGER. I PERSONALLY HOPE WE
WOULDN'T NEED PROPANE TANKS AND EVENTUALLY GET FOSSIL FUEL
HEATING. EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THE BUSINESSES GOING INTO
THE SECOND YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FURTHER QUESTIONS? I DON'T SEE ANY. WE CAN DO
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. AND FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU


PAGE 28

Sept. 27, 2021

FOR EVERYBODY WHO IS HERE ON SCREEN. WE WILL DO A ROLL CALL ON
PLACING THIS ON FILE AND CLOSING PUBLIC COMMENT.

DISCRIMINATION THAT WE MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SEE WITH COVID. FOR
EXAMPLE, SOURCE OF INCOME DISCRIMINATION FOR HOUSING FOR PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ANY SORT OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE FUNDS AND MAKE SURE
PEOPLE KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AROUND THAT.
AND POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE OTHER TOPICS THAT COMES UP THAT WE'LL
MESSAGE AROUND IS DISABILITY RELATED DISCRIMINATION FOR PEOPLE
POTENTIALLY NOW SUFFERING DISABILITIES RELATED HAVING HAD COVID

Executive Director of the

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO BRING FORWARD
THIS RESOLUTION AS ALL OF US KNOW NOW THAT MIKE WILL TAKE HIS LEAVE
FROM THE CENTRAL SQUARE BID. WE KNOW OVER THE YEAR HE HAS BEEN
AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB FROM STARTING THE BID, FROM THE AMBASSADORS
THAT WORK IN CENTRAL SQUARE TO HELP KEEP CENTRAL SQUARE TIDY,
FROM THE HELLO BACK AGAIN PROGRAM HE DID DURING COVID, DURING
THE COVID PERIOD. ALL THE WORK HE DID WITH THE RESTAURANTS, WITH
THE HOMELESS POPULATION. I CAN GO ON AND ON. HIS WORK WITH THE
BUSINESSES OF COLOR AND THE WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES TO MAKE
SURE THEY GET OFF THEIR KNEES AND ON THEIR FEET AFTER OR WHAT IS LEFT
OF THIS RAGING PANDEMIC.
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE. BUT I'M VERY SAD
FOR US AS THE CENTRAL SQUARE, IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE HE IS REALLY AN
EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMAN WHO HAS GIVEN HIS BEST AND HIS ALL TO
CAMBRIDGE, IN PARTICULAR, BUT CENTRAL SQUARE AS WELL. AND I'M SAD
TO SEE HIM GO AND I WANT US TO MARK HIS WORK AT THIS OCCASION OF
HIS LEAVING TO LET HIM KNOW THE CITY COUNCIL APPRECIATES ALL THAT HE
HAS DONE FOR CAMBRIDGE, FOR CENTRAL SQUARE, AND WE WISH HIM IN
THE BEST IN THE FUTURE ENDEAVOR. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. VICE MAYOR MALLON AND ANOTHER
COSPONSOR, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS FOR SPEARHEADING THIS EFFORT AND RESOLUTION TO AN
AMAZING HUMAN BEING, WHO I WILL PERSONALLY MISS IN CENTRAL
SQUARE. WE ALL KNOW, MICHAEL WAS THE FORCE BEHIND THE CENTRAL
SQUIRE IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT, 70% OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS TO SIGN


PAGE 31

Sept. 27, 2021

ON TO AN IDEA THAT FAILED BEFORE. IT WAS SO NECESSARY. AND JUMPED
RIGHT IN. TWO FEET INTO THE CENTRAL SQUARE MURAL PROJECT TO HONOR
THE PAST AND PRESENT AND EMBRACE THE FUTURE OF THE SQUARE. AND
ENSURED ALL THE DIVERSITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS REFLECTED IN THE
ARTWORK AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE AND THE
SMALL TEAM DID OVER THE PANDEMIC WAS REALLY INTRODUCE THE
CONCEPT OF STARLIGHT SQUARE, A PLACE FOR PEOPLE THAT USED TO BE A
PLACE FOR CARS, SHOWED US WHAT BIG IDEAS AND BIG HEART AND REALLY
A DRIVING AMBITION TO MAKE SURE CENTRAL SQUARE BECAME A PLACE OF
WONDER DURING THE PANDEMIC AND PEOPLE HAD A PLACE TOGETHER.
YOU LOOK AROUND, YOU CAN SEE SIGNS OF HIS CONSTANT ADVOCACY FOR
THE SMALL BUSINESS AND RESTAURANTS, OPPORTUNITY, PROTECTED BIKE
LANES, PATIO SEATS TO HELP RESTAURANTS. THE CRLS SENIOR PROM, SO
MANY THINGS. AND ONE THING THAT I MOST GRATEFUL TO MICHAEL FOR IS
HIS ADVOCACY OF HIRING AND HIS COMMITMENT TO WORKFORCE
DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL, SOME FORMERLY HOMELESS, AND PROVIDING
THAT HOUSING ADVOCACY, SKILLS TRAINING, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
SUPPORTS, TO HIS EMPLOYEES. IT IS REALLY SHOULD BE USED AS A MODEL
ACROSS THE CITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PROVIDE ON THE JOB
WORKFORCE SCREENING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. MICHAEL,
HE WORKED TIRELESSLY. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE SLEEPS. HE DOES IT WITH A
SMILE AND A NEW IDEA IN HIS BRAIN. ALL WITH THIS IDEA OF KEEPING
CENTRAL SQUARE AND TRANSFORMING TO A PLACE OF WONDER WHERE
SOMETHING IS ALWAYS HAPPENING. I SAY A BIG SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO HIS
FAMILY, HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS, WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR DAD, THEIR
HUSBAND, THEIR FAMILY WITH THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND CENTRAL
SQUARE FOR FIVE YEARS NOW. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO THEM AND FOR
THEIR SERVICE TO THE CITY AND CENTRAL SQUARE. BEST OF LUCK TO
MICHAEL, I KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING FAR. YOU STAY ON THE CENTRAL
SQUARE BID BOARD AND I'M EXCITED FOR WHAT IS NEXT FOR YOU. WE WILL
MISS YOU. AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID, WE'LL MISS YOU IN THE BID.
THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO OFFER MY THANKS TO
MICHAEL. IT IS A LITTLE FUNNY, HE ISN'T GOING FAR, BUT I WILL MISS
BUMPING INTO HIM WHERE WE OFTEN GET LUNCH. TO FOLLOW UP ON VICE
MAYOR MALLON, SHE IS RIGHT, HE GOT THE BID OVER THE FINISH LINE AFTER
25 PLUS YEARS WHEN IT WAS FIRST KICKED AROUND. AND HE IS A PERSON
OF ACTION. HE DIDN'T SIT AROUND AND HOLD 50,000 MEETINGS ABOUT
WHAT WE'LL DO AND HE TOOK ACTION. HE DOVE RIGHT IN. AND YOU ALL
KNOW, I LIVE HERE IN CENTRAL AND I HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TALK
ABOUT HOW CENTRAL IS THIS AND THAT. CENTRAL SQUARE IS FANTASTIC. I
WAS AT A restaurant OVERLOOKING MASS AVENUE AND THE PARK BELOW, I
SAID TO MY WIFE, THAT WAS A GAS STATION WHEN I WAS A KID. WITH
ABANDONED CARS AND NOW A BEAUTIFUL PARK. AND YOU LOOK AT THE
LIGHTS OUTSIDE AT THE OUTDOOR SEATING. IT IS REALLY AND AGAIN,
MICHAEL DUG IN. HE MADE CHANGES QUICKLY. AND ALSO, AS VICE MAYOR
MALLON SAID, ONE THING I ALWAYS SO APPRECIATE ABOUT MICHAEL AND


PAGE 32

Sept. 27, 2021

STILL DO, THERE WAS A LOT OF HESITATION BY FOLKS WHEN THE BID WAS
BEING PROPOSED THAT WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT ALL THE CHANGES AND
THEY WERE GOING TO COME TO CENTRAL SQUARE, THAT MEANT WE'D LOSE
OUR GRIT OR WE WERE GOING TO LOSE IT WAS GOING TO BECOME
"CLEANER" BY PUSHING OUT FOLKS THAT SPEND TIME IN CENTRAL SQUARE
THAT ARE UNHOUSED OR IN CAR BOUND PLAZA. MICHAEL WAS STEADFAST
THAT IS NOT THE INTENT AND HE IS COMPASSIONATE. DID SO MUCH TO
SUPPORT FOLKS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WE LOOK AT THE PORTA POTTIES
AND THE HANDWASHING STATIONS, HE HAD THEM IN PLACE BEFORE THE
CITY DID. IT WAS DONE BY THE BID.
HE IS NOT GOING FAR. I WILL MISS BUMPING INTO HIM AND I WILL ADD MY
CONGRATULATIONS AND THANKS. HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON AND WE'LL
MISS HIM IN CENTRAL.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WORK ON A NUMBER OF
REVITALIZED AREAS THROUGHOUT NEW ENGLAND IN MY PAST. AND THE
MAJOR SUCCESS FACTOR IS SOMEONE LOCAL WHO IS COMMITTED TO
PROGRESS. SOME TOWNS, I CAN NAME SOME VERY FAMILIAR TOWNS DID
NOT HAVE THAT, EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY LOVED WHAT WAS PROPOSED,
AND MICHAEL HAS THAT MAGIC THAT MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES WENT INTO
GREAT DETAIL ABOUT. IT WAS APPROPRIATE IN HIS CASE. WHATEVER HE
DOES, HE WILL BRING THAT ENERGY. I HOPE HE IS HAPPY WITH THAT.
THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT WE'LL MEET IN OUR LIVES. I
HAVE A QUESTION. DOES EVERY RESOLUTION GO WITH ALL COUNCIL LISTED
OR DO WE HAVE TO MOVE THAT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN MOVE TO ADD EVERYBODY.
>> IS THAT NORMAL OR DO WE PROPOSE MOVING IT? I FORGET.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> MR. CLERK: WHEN THE COUNCIL GOES TO RESOLUTIONS, I BELIEVE THERE
WAS A MOTION TO BRING THE RESOLUTIONS FORWARD AND MAKE THEM
UNANIMOUS UPON ADOPTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WAS THAT A MOTION?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I CAN MAKE IT. WE MOVE ALL THE RESOLUTIONS
FOR THIS EVENING MAKE THEM UNANIMOUS UPON ADOPTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT.
>> THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> ANYTHING CAN I DO FOR YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. I'M SORRY, COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WILL ADD TO THE ACCOLADES
BY JUST TELLING TWO BRIEF STORIES FROM SMALL TO LARGE. I HAD THE
PLEASURE OF BEING AT STARLIGHT THIS SATURDAY AT THE BOB MOSES
CELEBRATION OF LIFE. I WAS WATCHING MIKE GOING AROUND AND MAKING

PAGE 33

Sept. 27, 2021

SURE EVERYBODY HAD WATER. PEOPLE WHO WERE HUNGRY HAD FOOD.
HE'S JUST ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS TAKEN CARE OF AND I
JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ABOUT HIM.
A FEW MONTHS OKAY, I WAS WORKING WITH A LOCAL BLACK WOMAN
OWNED RESTAURANT IN CENTRAL SQUARE, TRYING TO SHEPARD THEM
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING THEIR OUTDOOR SEATING. AND MIKE
WAS HELPING WITH THAT, OF COURSE. AND THEY TEXTED ME THEY HAD NOT
HEARD FROM HIM IN A WHILE. I TEXTED MIKE AND SAID, HOW IS IT GOING
WITH THIS RESTAURANT. AND HE SAID, I HAVE BEEN BITTEN BY A DOG. SO I
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON IT. BUT I WILL GET RIGHT ON IT. A FEW
DAYS LATER, THEY HAD THE OUTDOOR SEATING SET UP. HE IS GOING DOWN
AS A LEGEND IN MY BOOK AS HAVING THE BEST EXCUSE EVER FOR
SOMETHING BEING DELAYED. JUST AN AMAZING RESPONSE TO MAKE SURE IT
WAS TAKEN CARE OF AS SOON AS HE COULD. WE WILL GREATLY MISS HIM
AND I HOPE THAT WHEREVER HE IS GOING NEXT, WE'LL BE APPRECIATED
BECAUSE WE REALLY APPRECIATE HIM A LOT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WON'T BE LONG BECAUSE THE LAST
THING HE WANTS US TO DO IS SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON HIM RIGHT NOW.
MICHAEL, MAN OF ACTION, LET'S GO OUT AND IMPROVE. A FIRST MEETING
UPON TAKEN OFFICE IS MEETING HIM. HE IS A WHIRLWIND OF
EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT. HE ASKED ME TO DO MORE THAN I EVER
THOUGHT I POSSIBLY COULD AND I APPRECIATE HIM FOR THAT. AND I'M IF
HE DOES LISTEN TO THIS, I WILL REPEAT TO HIM WHAT I HEARD WHEN HE
LEFT. I'M COUNTING ON HIM TO MAKE GOOD TROUBLE, WHERE HE ENDS UP
TO CONTINUE TO MAKE GOOD TROUBLE, IMPACT ON THIS CITY. AND TO
HOLD US TO HIGHER STANDARDS THAN WE HAVE BEEN HELD BEFORE. I
TOTALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE AND ALL OF YOU WHO
SUPPORTED A LOT OF THE WORK IN CENTRAL SQUARE AND HIS CO WOKERS
AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I GREAT WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID.
WE'LL MISS WORKING WITH HIM IN THIS CAPACITY AND REALLY GREATLY
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE AND WISH HIM THE BEST. ON
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS' MOTION TO ADOPT THIS RESOLUTION. ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION NUMBER FOUR. NATIONAL
DIAPER NEED AWARENESS WEEK. FILED BY VICE MAYOR MALLON AND
MYSELF.

RESOLUTION #4
National Diaper Need
Awareness Week

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
COSPONSORSHIP OF THIS RESOLUTION. THIS WEEK IS NATIONAL NATIONAL
DIAPER NEED AWARENESS WEEK. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE CHALLENGES FAMILIES
WHO STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN DIAPERS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN THE
COUNTRY. I THANK LYNN OF CRADLES TO CRAYONS FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE
NEED IN CAMBRIDGE. THE CITY MANAGER GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED THE

PAGE 34

Sept. 27, 2021

BASEMENT OF CITY HALL TO BE CREATED INTO A DIAPER BANK LAST YEAR
BECAUSE WE WERE SEEING AN INCREASE NEED IN THE RESIDENTS AND
FAMILIES WHO NEEDED ACCESS TO HEALTHY SUPPLY OF DIAPERS WHEN THEY
WERE FACING JOB LOSSES AND FACING HIGHER FOOD PRICES.
WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE OF DEBBIE FROM THE CAMBRIDGE
PUBLIC SCHOOL DEPARTMENT, FAMILY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST, WE HAD A
TEAM OF VOLUNTEER DELIVERS DOZENS OF ORDERS TO CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO NEEDED DIAPERS, WIPES, HYGIENE KITS, FACE
MASKS. WE SAW FROM MARCH TO JUNE OF LAST YEAR THE NEED HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE IS GREAT. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A
SUSTAINABLE DIAPER BANK IN CAMBRIDGE. I THINK THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY CENTER AND THE SPOT CAMBRIDGE DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB TO
GET THE DIAPERS IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK WE NEED MORE FUNDING ON
A FEDERAL LEVEL AND I'M GLAD TO SEE CONGRESS IS ACTING ON THIS. THIS
RESOLUTION IS REALLY TO SUPPORT THOSE ACTIONS, BUT TO LIFT UP AND
THANK AND SUPPORT THE WORK THAT THE CRADLES TO CRAYONS DOES IN
THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE LOCKDOWN LAST
YEAR WHEN THE NEED WAS SO GREAT. THANK YOU TO CRADLES TO
CRAYONS, CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, LYNN AND KIRSTIN, FOR COMING
TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED. I HOPE
OUR COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND
DIAPER AWARENESS WEEK AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY JUST DON'T
KNOW. THANK YOU. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. A QUICK NOTE. THANK YOU MAYOR
SIDDIQUI AND VICE MAYOR MALLON, THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THIS IS
EXACTLY WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STEP IN WHEN
NEEDED AND THANK THE CITY MANAGER AND OTHERS FOR MAKING THAT
HAPPEN WITH THE DIAPER BANK IN THE BASEMENT. IT IS CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT. UNTIL YOU ARE A PARENT, YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DIAPERS. A LITTLE KNOWN
FACT, I ALMOST STARTED A DIAPER RECYCLING COMPANY BECAUSE THERE'S
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RELATED TO THIS. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING
ABOUT DIAPERS. AND THANK YOU FOR SPONSORING THIS. THIS IS AN
IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK TO IDENTIFY THE NEED AND I'M GRATEFUL
TO ALL OF YOU FOR WORKING ON THIS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN TO CRADLES TO
CRAYONS. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING THIS RESOLUTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN,
HAD TO STEP OUT. HE REQUESTED HE BE RECORDED AS A YES, UNLESS
THERE'S AN OBJECTION TO THE COUNCIL? NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION ON THE DEATH OF ROB
WILLIAMS. COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE THE SUBSTITUTE
RESOLUTION IN MY HASTE TO GET THIS TOGETHER FOR US SO WE HAVE IT
FOR TONIGHT. I MADE ERRORS. I HAVE A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION THAT I'D


PAGE 35

Motion by Councillor Simmons

substitution

Sept. 27, 2021

LIKE TO OFFER. I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE THE CLERK HAS IT. IF HE DOESN'T
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HE'LL PULL IT UP.

RESOLITION #6 AS
AMENDED
Resolution on the death of Rob
Wilson

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IT IS REWRITTEN. I WILL GIVE MY COLLEAGUES A
MOMENT TO GO THROUGH IT.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
HE WORKED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR A LONG TIME. COMES
TO WORK AND THEN PASSES.
(CONTINUING TO READ FROM THE SLIDE PRESENTATION). I WILL GO TO THE
RESOLVE PARAGRAPH.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
AGAIN, IN MY HASTE TO GET IT BEFORE US, THERE WERE ERRORS AND THE
CORRECT THING IS TO PUT IN A SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION. I RESCIND THE
ONE THAT IS IN OUR AGENDA AND OFFER THIS AS A SUBSTITUTE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE A SUBSTITUTE ORDER BEFORE US. ROLL CALL
ON SUBSTITUTING THE RESOLUTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE SUBSTITUTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION AS AMENDED.
>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION SEVEN. THANK YOU TO FIRE
FIGHTER CAMERON MONAGLE. FILED BY MYSELF, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS,
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, VICE MAYOR MALLON, CAMERON, HE PERFORMED AN
OFF DUTY RESCUE IN THE CHARLES RIVER. WE ARE REALLY PROUD AND THE
SON OF THE CITY AUDITOR, JIM. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF HIM AND WANT TO
THANK HIM AGAIN. COUNCILLOR NOLAN, PULLED THIS?

RESOLUTION #7
Thanking Cameron Monagle
for his actions and
congratulating him for his
recent award

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I PULLED IT BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE
TO BE ADDED. CAMERON WAS IN MY SON'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS. I
REMEMBER HIM FROM THEN AND SEEN HIM THROUGH THE YEARS.
ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWED CAMBRIDGE SPORTS, KNOWS HE RIGHT
THROUGH TODAY WAS INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF SPORTS. I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE DOING MAKE THEM UNANIMOUS. IF WE'RE NOT, IF WE ARE
ALREADY DOING THAT, THAT WAS MOVED. I WANT TO SAY THRILLED TO
SEE THIS ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS MADE THAT INFORMATION.
WE ARE ALL SET. YOU WILL BE ON IT. COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO MY COSPONSORS
FOR SUBMITTING THIS RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING CAMERON. I HAVE
KNOWN CAMERON FOR MANY YEARS AND THE MOTHER IS MAUREEN TRAVIS,
THE TRAVIS FAMILY GREW UP IN FOLKERSON STREET. THE TRADITION
CONDITIONS WITH HIS GRANDSON BEING PART OF THIS FAMILY PURPOSING

PAGE 36

Sept. 27, 2021

PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE CITY FOR MANY YEARS. CAMERON IS OUT AND ABOUT
WITH HIS MOTHER AND TO OF HER FRIENDS WHEN THIS PERSON JUMPED
INTO THE RIVER AND HE WAS THERE TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY HE COULD.
CERTAINLY SHOWED TREMENDOUS BRAVERY AND COURAGE IN DOING THIS
RESCUE. TO HIM AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CAMBRIDGE FIRE
DEPARTMENT FAMILY, WE THANK THEM FOR WHAT THEY DO ON A DAILY
BASIS. MOST UNSEEN AND UNSUNG. THANK YOU TO ALL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ROLL CALL ON ADOPTING THE
RESOLUTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDERS. PLEASURE OF THE CITY
COUNCIL? I'M HEARING COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WILL PULL 1 AND 2.
POLICY ORDER #3
Affirming Reproductive
Freedom

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: 4.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: 6. ID.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON 3, 5.

POLICY ORDER #5
End Title 42 Deportations

>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTING POLICY ORDERS 3 AND 5. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN
FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: I WAS MUTED. PRESENT ON THREE AND YES ON
FIVE. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT I WAS UNMUTED.
>> MR. CLERK: SO RECORDED. PRESENT ON THREE AND YES ON FIVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER ONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THE CITY COUNCIL IS ALWAYS
STOOD OUT AND STOOD TALL AND STOOD FOR THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS,
EVEN IF THE INDIVIDUALS DIDN'T LIVE IN THE CITY. AS WE HAVE WATCHED
THE TELEVISION AND WORLD EVENTS, THE DEPLORABLE TREATMENT OF THE
HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS IN TEXAS HAS BEEN MORE THAN I COULD JUST SIT
BACK AND WATCH. AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT, THE CITY
THAT BELIEVES IN EQUAL AND CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, TAKE A STAND AND
MAKE A STATEMENT AROUND THIS TREATMENT. IN THE HOPE THAT MAYBE
IF WE DO OTHER THE WILL. IF ADOPTED, WE CAN SEND THIS ALSO TO THE
FEDERAL DELEGATIONS SO THEY KNOW THAT CAMBRIDGE FEELS THIS IS AN
OUTRAGE TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. IT IS ADDING INSULT TO INJURY. AND
SOMEONE NEEDS TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I THINK WE SHOULD DO
WHAT WE CAN. IF IT IS RAISING OUR VOICES, THEN RAISE OUR VOICES WE
SHOULD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I AGREE. HI SO MANY HAITIAN AMERICANS
RESIDENTS REACH OUT TO ME THIS WEEK. JUST SCARED, AFRAID, ALONE,
AND FEELING UNSEEN. IT IS AMENDABLE TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, I

PAGE 37

Sept. 27, 2021

WOULD LOVE TO BE A COSPONSOR AND I THINK THIS MAY BE A PLACE WHERE
WE ALL WANT TO BE RAISE OUR VOICE AND DO THAT SUPPORTING THAT
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS JUST MENTIONED FOR OUR HAITIAN RESIDENTS WHO
ARE FEEL UNSEEN AND UNHEARD. IF IT IS AMENDABLE TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS, I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR.

MOTION TO ADD THE
ENTIRE COUNCIL TO
POLICY ORDER #1

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: CERTAINLY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL ADD I THINK THE ENTIRE COUNCIL TO THE
ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

POLICY ORDER #1 AS
AMENDED
Resolution Condemning the
Treatment of Haitian
Immigrants in Texas

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED? ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POLICY ORDER NUMBER TWO. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER 2).
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. IT CAME TO MY ATTENTION THAT
THIS BUILDING, CALLED THE CAMBRIDGE SAVINGS BANK BUILDING, I BELIEVE,
MAYBE OR IS GOING UP FOR SALE. THE OWNERS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND
SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION FOUNDED BACK IN 1940. THIS BUILDING IS
HISTORICAL IN ITS OWN RIGHT. I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN WOULD
AGREE. WE REMEMBER THIS BUILDING AS ALWAYS BEING A HUB OF
ACTIVITY. YES, IT HAS BEEN A BANK. I CAN REMEMBER DAYS WHEN PEOPLE
HAD BLUEBOOKS WALKING INTO THE CAMBRIDGEPORT SAVINGS BANK,
CHILDREN HAVING PENNY ACCOUNTS, THE QUARTER SAVERS, IT HAS
CHANGED HANDS, IT STILL HAS A LOT OF HISTORICAL MEMORY AND
NOSTALGIA. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING. IF YOU LOOK OVER THE MANY
PHOTOS OF CENTRAL SQUARE, YOU WILL SEE THIS BUILDING STANDING OUT.

POLICY ORDER #2
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to reach
out to the owner of 689
Massachusetts Avenue to
inquire about the prospect of
selling this building to the City
of Cambridge, and to report
back to the City Council on this
matter in a timely manner

I BELIEVE THAT THE CITY SHOULD MAKE SOME ATTEMPT, IF IT IS INDEED UP
FOR SALE, TO PURCHASE THIS BUILDING SO IT CAN BE USED BY SOME
COMMUNITY OR CIVIC USE. ONE THING THAT MICHAEL ALWAYS WANTED TO
DO, WE DO HAVE A CENTRAL SQUARE THEATER, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING
AND HAS A BEAUTIFUL IT HAS A WONDERFUL PROGRAMMING LEGACY, NOT
A LEGACY, THEY HAVE WONDERFUL PROGRAMMING. CENTRAL SQUARE TO
HAVE AN ANCHOR AND MAYBE THAT'S THE POSSIBILITY TO HAVE AN ANCHOR
TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT IS STARTED BY MIKE AND
OTHERS. I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL STAND AND SUPPORT THIS ORDER TO SEE
IF WE CAN GET THE BUILDING OF OUR CARE, CUSTODY, AND CONTROL FOR
SOME SORT OF CIVIC OR COMMUNITY YOUTH WE CAN DECIDE ONCE IT IS IN
OUR CONTROL. I THINK WE SHOULD CERTAINLY MAKE THE EFFORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS. I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA. I'LL JUST SAY, ONE
THING THAT I HAVE GOTTEN MANY CALLS ABOUT IS MORE COMMUNITY
SPACES TO RENT OUT AND ROOMS TO USE FOR DIFFERENT CELEBRATIONS
AND THE LIST GOES ON. I THINK CIVIC USING IS A GOOD USE. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?


PAGE 38

Sept. 27, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I FULLY SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I
THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT COMMUNITY SPACE, MAYBE EVEN THE FUTURE
HOME OF THE CAMBRIDGE MUSEUM.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MAY BE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WILL NOTE, THE HISTORICAL COMMISSION
RECENTLY PASSED UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO LANDMARK THIS BUILDING,
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO PROTECT THE
HISTORICAL VALUE IS FOR THE CITY TO OWN AND MANAGE IT. I DO HOPE WE
CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MAY I? A FOLLOW UP ON COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. IT CAME UP IN PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT THE HISTORICAL
COMMISSION PASSING UP ON THIS. IT WAS BECAUSE AT THE HEARING, THEY
SAID, THERE WAS NO INTENTION. THEY MAY NO KNOWLEDGE OR
STATEMENT OF THINKING ABOUT SELLING THAT BUILDING. I THINK THE
COMMISSION FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PASS ON LANDMARKING. THEY SAY
HINDSIGHT IS 20/20. THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR CARLONE AND THEN COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH
A MOVE AND WHY I AGREE FULLY WITH THE POLICY ORDER, IS THAT WE CAN
EASILY MOVE WE NEED MORE OFFICE SPACE. WE NEED MORE OFFICE
SPACE IN THE CITY AND CERTAIN FACILITIES ARE CROWDED. AND THE
EXISTING LOMBARDI BUILDING IS LESS THAN CIVIC IN MANY WAYS THAN THE
BUILDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAS A CIVIC PRESENCE. AND THERE'S
ENOUGH SPACE IN THERE TO MOVE PEOPLE THERE, WHICH WOULD ALLOW
THE EXISTING LOMBARDI BUILDING SERVE ANOTHER USE, POSSIBLY EVEN
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A NEW BUILDING ON THE SITE.
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE LOMBARDI BUILDING, WHICH IS
DESPERATELY IN NEED, WE NEED ANOTHER SPACE TO MOVE TO. I SUPPORT
THIS ON BOTH OF THOSE REASONS. AND I YIELD. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS. I SUPPORT THIS AND YES, I HAD MY FIRST PASSPORT ACCOUNT
SAVINGS ACCOUNT THERE WHEN I WAS SIX. IT HAS BEEN MY BANK
LOCATION, EVEN THOUGH THE BANK CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES. IT IS A
GORGEOUS BUILDING. AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE CITY PURCHASING
MORE OPEN SPACE TO DECIDE WHAT IS BUILT. THAT GOES FOR BUILDINGS,
TOO. AND SO, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY IF IT SHOULD GO FORWARD TO HAVE
THE CITY PURCHASE THIS INCREDIBLE BUILDING, HISTORIC BUILDING, TO
THEN WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST USE IS
FOR THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN GOING TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER WHO
MAY WANT TO USE IT FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AS COMMUNITY
ORIENTED.
REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS AND I HOPE MY GUESS LIKE ANY BIT OF
PROPERTY ON THE MARKET IN CAMBRIDGE, IT PROBABLY WON'T STAY LONG.


PAGE 39

Sept. 27, 2021

I HOPE THE MANAGER MOVES ON THIS QUICKLY WITH A PHONE CALL
TOMORROW MORNING. I'M SURE HE IS WATCHING, START THE
CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT THE POSSIBILITY IS. THANK YOU AND THANK
YOU COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION POLICY ORDER 4. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 4).
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I THANK EVERYBODY WHO
CALLED IN TODAY. WE HAVE ALL RECEIVED NUMEROUS EMAILS AND CALLS
ABOUT THE CONCERNS AROUND WHAT HAPPENED THIS SUMMER. I THINK
PEOPLE WERE, AT LEAST PEOPLE I SPOKE TO, WERE LESS UPSET ABOUT THE
CHANGE IN WHICH CHILDREN WERE ASSIGNED TO THE PROGRAMS AND
MORE ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION PIECE. FINDING OUT TWO OR THREE
DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS YOU DON'T HAVE AN AFTER SCHOOL
PLACEMENT. I HAVE 11 YEAR OLD TWINS WHO DON'T HAVE AN AFTER
SCHOOL PLACEMENT. I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE AND SAY THAT I AGREE
WITH THE COMMENTS IN PUBLIC COMMENT BY MS. WINESTOCK, THAT WE
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND HOW TO SERVE MORE
CHILDREN AND HOW ARE WE MORE EQUITABLE AND MAKE SURE THAT
CHILDREN WHO WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THE PROGRAMS HAVE
FULL ACCESS.
THIS ORDER WAS REALLY MEANT WASN'T MEANT TO BE THAT BROAD. IT
WAS REALLY SPECIFIC TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED THIS
SUMMER. THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I MEANT NO DISRESPECT TO
THE LARGER ISSUE. AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYBODY ON THAT. I WANT
TO GET SOME ANSWERS AROUND AND BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THE
MISSTEPS WERE SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I BELIEVE VICE MAYOR
MALLON HAS AN AMENDMENT. I'M AGREEABLE TO. AND HOPEFULLY WE
CAN GET THIS REPORT AND THIS MEETING RELATIVELY SOON TO GET SOME
ANSWERS AND MOVE ON TO OTHER MORE SYSTEMIC CHANGES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT. LET'S HAVE THE
AMENDMENT BEFORE US. VICE MAYOR MALLON, YOU WANT TO PULL IT UP
AND ASK THE CLERK.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: I SENT IT TO THE CLERK AND IT IS ON THE SCREEN.
TO SPEAK BRIEFLY AND ADDING TO WHAT COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SPOKE
ABOUT, LOTS OF US HAVE HEARD FROM MANY PARENTS WHO HAVE
CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE DHS PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES
THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR. WHY THEY HAPPENED THIS YEAR AND WHY THEY
HAPPENED SO LATE. WHY THEY FELT LIKE WE HAD A HEARING HERE IN THE
HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE THAT COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SHARED THIS
SUMMER WHERE DHS STAFF, THEY SAID IF YOUR CHILD HAD A SPACE IN 2020,
YOU WILL HAVE A SPACE THIS FALL. THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. THERE
WAS CONFUSION IN THE LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT IS A DHSP AFTER SCHOOL
WHAT PARENTS HEARD WAS A RELIEF THERE WOULD BE A SPOT FOR THE

PAGE 40

Sept. 27, 2021

CHILD. IT TURNS OUT, THERE WASN'T A SPOT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
NO AFTER CARE AFTER MANY MONTHS OVER 2020 AND 2021 WHERE THERE
WAS NO AFTER CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
THE ONE AMENDMENT THAT IS BEFORE US IS TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE
AROUND THE FEASIBILITY OF APPOINTING A PARENT ADVISORY BOARD TO
HELP IN FUTURE PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES. THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT
SOME OF THE CAREGIVERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FAMILY OF COLOR OF
COALITION, ARE TALKING ABOUT. AND HOW TO BRING THIS FORWARD SO
THE VOICES THAT ARE MOST MARGINALIZED AND VULNERABLE AND THE
VOICES THAT WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR WHEN WE MAKE PROGRAMMATIC
CHANGES ARE AT THE TABLE. THEY ASKED US TO TAKE THE LANGUAGE OUT
AND AS COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN SAID, I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY MISSTEP. IT
WASN'T INTENTIONAL. WE CAN TAKE IT OUT. THE HOPE WAS THAT WE'D BE
ABLE TO HAVE BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AT THE COMMITTEE
HEARING. HOPEFULLY, WE'LL BE HAVING, SHOULD OUR COLLEAGUES PASS
THIS FORWARD, THIS AMENDMENT TAKES OUT THAT LANGUAGE AND ALLAYS
THAT CONCERN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LET'S SEE. WE HAVE THE AMENDMENT BEFORE US.
ANY QUESTIONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I SUPPORT THE ORDER. I DO THANK
MY COLLEAGUE FOR STRIKING THAT LINE. ONE THING THAT CAME TO MIND
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING IN AS A LATE ORDER, I'D RATHER CONFER WITH
COLLEAGUES ABOUT LANGUAGE, SOME OF YOU WILL REMEMBER THE
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ORGANIZATION ALL HAD COUNCILS. COMMUNITY
SCHOOLS COUNCIL AND THE COUNCILS WERE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO HAVE INPUT ON PROGRAMMING. AND
THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO IN THE CITY. THERE ARE FEW TO NO
COMMUNITY SCHOOL COUNCILS. THE COUNCIL TALKS, RIGHTFULLY SO,
AROUND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND HOW TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED.
THESE COMMUNITY COUNCILS, IN MY THINKING, WOULD BE ONE PLACE AND
ONE WAY TO DO THAT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH MY
COLLEAGUES. I CAN'T TALK TO EVERYBODY ALL AT ONCE. MAYBE MY
COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM, ALPHABETICALLY OR WHATEVER,
PUT FORWARD A POLICY ORDER THAT ASK THAT WE LOOK WHY DON'T WE
HAVE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS ANYMORE, WHICH WERE
REALLY GRASSROOTS, NEIGHBORHOOD BASED. WE HAVE A COLLECTION OF
SCHOOLS THAT ARE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS, CITY WIDE NEIGHBORHOOD
SCHOOLS, NOT SCHOOLS WHERE NECESSARILY THE PARENTS MAY SEND THEIR
CHILDREN WHERE IT IS CLOSE TO WHERE THEY LIVE. THAT'S WHAT
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GAVE THE COMMUNITY. A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN
ORGANIZE, COME TOGETHER, MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON WHAT
PROGRAMMING THEY WOULD WANT.
SO, I WILL CONFER WITH A FEW COLLEAGUES, BRING IT TO THE FLOOR, AND
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, IF YOU HAVE A HEARING AROUND THAT
CONVERSATION AS WELL, I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. AGAIN,
TO VICE MAYOR MALLON, THANK YOU FOR WITHDRAWING THAT. I WANT TO


PAGE 41

Sept. 27, 2021

SIGN ON AND SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER, WE'LL TAKE NOT TAKE A STEP
FURTHER, BUT INTRODUCE ANOTHER PIECE OR POLICY ORDER THAT SPEAKS
SPECIFICALLY TO PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT THAT IS BROAD AND DIVERSE AND
ORGANIC WHERE PEOPLE CAN REALLY BE INVOLVED. I'M NOT GOING TO
OFFER THAT ORDER. I WILL DO THAT FOR THE NEXT MEETING. I DON'T WANT
TO BRING IT IN AS LATE, THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO THE COMMUNITY. I
SUPPORT THE ORDER AS AMENDED. WITH THAT, I WILL STAND DOWN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND
THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. ARE WE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE
AMENDMENT OR
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE AMENDMENT AND THE
POLICY ORDER.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I THANK EVERYBODY WHO WORKED
ON IT. I WAS HAPPY TO SIGN ON TO THIS. AND REMIND YOU, THIS IS
LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS. MY KIDS HAVE GRADUATED COLLEGE AND YET,
WHEN THEY WERE AT THE AGE WHERE I NEEDED CARE, THERE WERE
SOMETIMES COMMUNICATION, THERE WERE ISSUES, CAN I GET COVERAGE
OR NOT. USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, HOW IS IT THAT WE ARE STILL IN A
SITUATION WHERE THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR
MY COLLEAGUES FOR IDENTIFYING THIS AS AN EXPLICIT ISSUE THAT WE HAVE
TO ADDRESS. AND THE WAY TO DO IT, UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS SO WE
CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A BETTER PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. AND AS
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN NOTED, WITH 11 YEAR OLDS WITHOUT CARE,
PARENTS HAVE COME TO US AND SAID NOT ONLY THEY DIDN'T KNOW, THE
CHANGES WERE THERE, FOR SOME, THERE IS FINANCIAL CHANGES THAT
CAME ABOUT THAT WAS GOING TO PUT THEM AT RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE
TO AFFORD THE CARE THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD. AND WE ALL HEARD AND
UNDERSTOOD EVERYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A PLACEMENT. THAT
WASN'T THE CASE. IT IS PARTLY DUE TO SOME LABOR SHORTAGE.
COMMUNICATE THAT AND LET PEOPLE KNOW. LET'S NOT JUST HAVE PEOPLE
BE HELD AND NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF
SOMEONE NOT KNOWING AND SAYING YOU TOLD US YOU WILL TELL US BY
MID AUGUST. THEY NOT KNEW AND THREW OUT EMAILS AND CALLS TO THE
VOID AND NOT HEARING BACK. WHAT WE NEED TO OWN AND UNDERSTAND,
HOW TO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES SO THE PARENTS WILL HEAR BACK WITH
THE NEWS. EVEN IF IT IS NOT GOOD NEWS, WHEN MY KIDS NEEDED CARE
AND I WORKED FULL TIME, TO NOT KNOW FOR WEEKS WHETHER OR NOT I
HAVE COVERAGE, CREATED STRESS THAT IS HIGHER THAN NECESSARY. WE
KNOW THAT. LET'S TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, THIS WAS NOT
HANDLED WELL AND ALL THE QUESTION OF I'M AN EDUCATED PARENT WHO
SPEAKS ENGLISH, I CAN PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL. THERE'S A LOT OF
PARENTS NOT IN THAT POSITION IT WAS MORE CHALLENGING TO FIND OUT
WHAT IS GOING ON.
I HOPE THE COLLEAGUES PASS THIS WITH US OR JOIN WITH US. AND AS WE
MOVE FORWARD AND AS THE HEARING HAPPENS, WE CAN IDENTIFY WAYS TO

PAGE 42

Sept. 27, 2021

ENSURE WE HAD A VISION FOREVER ABOUT HAVING A SEAMLESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITIES, IT DOESN'T MATTER IN
PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF AND
YOU ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE AT AND WE HAVEN'T
DELIVERED ON THAT. I HOPE THIS IS ANOTHER STEP ALONG THE WAY OF
MOVING TOWARDS THAT SYSTEM TO HOLD ALL OUR KIDS AND TRULY
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN SERVE FAMILIES AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO THE
COSPONSORS AND I WILL SUPPORT THIS ORDER. WHEN MY KIDS WERE
SMALL THEY WENT THROUGH THE KING OPEN EXTENDED DAY PROGRAM AND
WE ENJOYED THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL AS AN ADDITIONAL OPTION FOR
THEM. JUST TO GIVE THEM DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND REALLY HELP
ROUND OUT THEIR EDUCATION. I'M REALLY SAD THIS HAS HAPPENED. I
HOPE THAT WE WILL DO BETTER GOING FORWARD. AND WE'LL MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY IN OUR CITY HAS ACCESS TO THE GREAT PROGRAMS. THANK
YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: JUST BRIEFLY, I SUSPECT ALL OF US WHO ENJOYED
HAVING CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS, BOTH MY BOYS LOVED AFTER
SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO IT AND MY YOUNGER SON
AT KING OPEN, ON PUTNAM WHEN IT WAS THERE, LOVED IT IN PART
BECAUSE THERE WERE OLDER KIDS. KIDS OF ALL AGES. IT WAS A RELATIVELY
SMALL GROUP. AS THE SECOND GRADER, HE HAD FIFTH GRADE FRIENDS. IT
WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AS I SAID FOR BOTH OF THEM. IT EXTENDED
SCHOOL DAY. IT CHANGED. IT BROADENED WHAT SCHOOL MEANT. I THINK
THAT'S A HEALTHY THING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: COUPLE OF FOLKS HAVE BROUGHT IT UP. I
THINK IT IS REALLY TRUE AROUND THE WE HAVE A CONFUSING SYSTEM. WE
HAVE DHSP PRE SCHOOLS IN SCHOOL. WE HAVE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS, SPECIAL START AND THE PRE SCHOOL PROGRAM AT FMA AND
MONTESSORI. THEY ARE SCHOOL PROGRAMS, BUT THEY ARE BEFORE
SCHOOL AGE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE BETTER AT. HALF
THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH PEOPLE IS JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. AND SO, I THINK MAYBE THOSE WHO DO
THIS ALL THE TIME, WE ASSUME PEOPLE KNOW. IT IS PRETTY SELF
EXPLANATORY, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T. A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO. AM I ASKING FOR A DHSP PROGRAM, SCHOOL PROGRAM, OR
COMMUNITY SCHOOLS? THE COMMUNICATION PIECE AND MAKING ALL OF
THIS MORE CLEAR FOR PEOPLE HAS GOT TO BE A PRIORITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I WILL ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE
SAID. THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE AND SUPERINTENDENT HAVE DEFINITELY
HEARD A LOT ON THIS. PEOPLE THINK THAT DHSP IS THE SCHOOLS. AND NOT
THE CITY. THERE'S BEEN WE HAVE DEFINITELY HEARD A LOT OF THE BULK

OF THIS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO
TALK ABOUT AND REALLY FIGURE OUT SOME SOLUTIONS. I THINK IT HAS
BEEN SUGGESTED TO HAVE LISTENING SESSIONS THAT DHSP HAS WITH
FAMILIES. THERE'S A LOT OF HEALING THAT WILL HAVE TO TAKE PLACE
AROUND THE ISSUES. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION
LAPSES THAT WERE MADE AND DO BETTER BY OUR FAMILIES WHO ARE
REALLY DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING. IF YOU DON'T SEE SOMETHING COMING,
WE HAVEN'T COMMUNICATED IT ENOUGH. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
HEARING AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN FOR PICKING UP MY
PHONE CALL AFTER SAYING WE NEED A HEARING ON THIS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. ONE LAST THING TO END ON A
MORE POSITIVE NOTE ON THIS. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I HAVE
HEARD AND I WOULD IMAGINE YOU ALL HAVE, THE PROGRAMS ARE IN VERY
HIGH DEMAND BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY GOOD PROGRAM AND PEOPLE
WANT THEIR KIDS IN THE PROGRAMS. AND PEOPLE WORK VERY HARD. I
DON'T WANT THAT TO GET LOST. THERE WERE MISTAKES THAT HAPPENED
AND MISSTEPS. THINGS WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. IF PEOPLE DIDN'T
WANT THEIR CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS, NOBODY WOULD CARE
WHETHER THEY DIDN'T GET A SPOT. I DO WANT TO I DON'T WANT FOLKS
TO THINK WE ARE BASHING THEM. THEY DO AN AMAZING JOB
ADMINISTRATIVELY AND WE HAVE TO REVIEW AND FIND OUT WHAT WENT
WRONG AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ABSOLUTELY. A HARD TIME FOR EVERYBODY AND
ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND DOING THE WORK AND
PLANNING. I KNOW IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. I THINK COMMUNICATING
AND REFLECTING AND LEARNING FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND MOVING
FORWARD IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER
ON THIS MOVING FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO OUR
DEPARTMENT AND MAKING SURE THE FAMILY VOICES ARE HEARD. AND WE
KEEP THIS ON TOP OF MIND. I LOOK FORWARD TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN
SCHEDULING THIS. WE CAN GO FROM THERE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I LOST TRACK. THIS IS THE WHOLE COUNCIL
APPROVING THIS OR WE HAVE TO MOVE THAT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT FROM VICE MAYOR
MALLON. WE'LL DO THAT AND THEN ADD THE ENTIRE COUNCIL ON YOUR
MOTION. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON VICE MAYOR MALLON'S AMENDMENT
TO STRIKE THE LANGUAGE. AND THEN THE MOTION FROM YOU, COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, TO ADD EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION. AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY VICE MAYOR
MALLON. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE AMENDMENT TO ADD THE ENTIRE COUNCIL.
>> MR. CLERK: ENTIRE COUNCIL HAS SPONSORS: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN

>> MR. CLERK: ON THE POLICY ORDER AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POLICY ORDER NUMBER SIX. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 6).
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WAS APPROACHED WITH THIS
POLICY ORDER IN MIND AS THE RELATED MATERIAL INDICATED THEY WENT
AFTER COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT FUNDS FOR AS LITTLE OF $24,000.
AND WERE NOT GRANTED THAT. THIS IS A SIMPLE MARKER WHERE THE FIRST
TREE ON MEMORIAL DRIVE WAS PLANTED BASED ON PLANS BY FREDERICK
OLMSTED AND CHARLES ELLIOT. OLMSTED IS WELL KNOWN FOR FRANKLIN
PARK AND CENTRAL PARK. BUT HE IS AN AMAZING PERSON IN THE SENSE
THAT HE FAILED MISERABLY ON EARLIER PROFESSIONS. FARMING, MINING,
AND ALSO HE WASN'T HAPPY IN THOSE FIELDS. THERE'S A REAL LESSON.
THERE'S A GREAT BOOK CALLED "A CLEARING IN THE DISTANCE." IT IS NOT
BIG, IT IS PRETTY SHORT. HE WROTE ABOUT SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH AND
HOW WRONG IT WAS. ALL DIFFERENT AREAS HE LOOKED INTO AND DIDN'T
SUCCEED. HE MIXED THEM TOGETHER AND CREATED AMERICAN LANDSCAPE
ARCHITECTURE.

POLICY ORDER #4 AS
AMENDED
That the City Manager direct
the Department of Human
Service Programs to issue a
report, including but not
limited to, the specific changes
in programming that were
made this year

JUST BRILLIANT. WHAT IS INTERESTING, CHARLES ELLIOT, WAS ALSO A LOCAL
PERSON. VERY GIFTED AND BECAME A PARTNER AT 30 SOMETHING IN
OLMSTED'S FIRM AND UNFORTUNATELY DIED AROUND 38 OR SO. VERY, VERY
YOUNG. AND A MAJOR LOSS. THE TWO TOGETHER REALLY INITIATED A
REGIONAL PARK SYSTEM IN GREATER BOSTON CAMBRIDGE ON AND ON. YOU
MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS, BUT WHERE THE NEW SCHOOL IS ON CAMBRIDGE
STREET, THAT RECENTLY OLD LAST YEAR, THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL OLMSTED
PARK WITH A GREAT SKATING POND, IT WAS BUILT UPON AND LANDFILLED.
BOTH OF THEM HAD AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON OUR CITY AND THIS SIMPLE
MARKER, WHICH A LOCAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT NATIONALLY KNOWN AND
AT LEAST UP UNTIL LAST YEAR, A LEAD PROFESSOR AT THE SCHOOL OF
DESIGN FOR LANDSCAPE, PUT TOGETHER THIS SIMPLE PROPOSAL THAT
SHOWS A MARKER THAT WOULD BE PLACED WHERE THE FIRST TREE WAS
PLANTED. AS YOU KNOW, THE SYCAMORES ARE THE TREES, EVEN THOUGH IT
WAS A GOOD TIME AGO, OVER 100 YEARS.
THIS WOULD HELP TELL THE STORY. AND I ASSUME AND HOPE THAT
EVERYONE WILL BE IN FAVOR OF THIS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. WE
ARE ALL SUPPORTIVE AND WE CAN DO ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION OF THE
POLICY ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: ADOPTION ON THE POLICY ORDER NUMBER SIX: (ROLL CALL).
NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO ROUNDTABLE MINUTES. THERE ARE NONE.
