What is Affordable Housing
Development?
• Typically funded by the City’s Affordable Housing
Trust
• Affordable housing providers currently developing
new affordable housing:
•
•
•
•

Cambridge Housing Authority
Just A Start Corporation
Homeowner’s Rehab, Inc.
Capstone Communities / Hope Real Estate

• Affordable housing developers must:
• Identify properties where affordable housing
development is financially feasible
• Compete in the market for buildings and sites
• Assemble subsidy funding needed to build new housing
from city, state and federal funders, often through
competitions for scarce funding
• Meet affordability, design, construction, management and
operating criteria of all funders
• Put in place long-term deed restrictions to ensure
continued affordability of new housing created

Affordable Housing in the City

Challenges to building affordable housing:
•

High land costs and competition from market-rate developers

•

Appeal of discretionary approvals can add significant cost, long delays, and significant risk to affordable housing developer s.

•

More difficult to build affordable housing in some areas of the city given zoning limitations
Packet Pg. 6

August 4, 2020

• Help affordable housing providers have more success in
purchasing sites to create new affordable housing;
• Foster equitable distribution of affordable housing
citywide by expanding the viability of affordable
housing in areas where there are fewer affordable
units;
• Create opportunities in all neighborhoods for residents
of all incomes;
• Make it easier to permit 100% affordable housing
developments so that affordable housing developers
can build needed housing more quickly; and
• Help reduce costs of building new affordable housing to
accomplish more with affordable housing funds.

Zoning Petition

Communication: Affordable Hosuing Overlay_20200804 (Public Hearings)

Our Current Zoning
• Some districts more restrictive
than others – most allow
multifamily housing, some
don’t

• Many existing buildings don’t
conform to current standards
– special permits and
variances are typical
• Affordable housing projects
have the option to seek a
comprehensive permit (40B)

Packet Pg. 10

August 4, 2020

Community Development Department

The intent of an Affordable Housing Overlay is to
create clear and predictable requirements for
affordable housing projects as an alternative to
the comprehensive permit (40B) process.

• Less restrictive standards to enable 100%affordable housing projects to be competitive
with market housing
• More predictable review and permitting
process
Temple Place: the comprehensive permit for this 40-unit affordable development was
appealed, delaying the project for almost 3 years, and forcing a re-design of the building
which resulted in the reduction of family-size units and the loss of 2 units

• Standards applied citywide to enable affordable
housing in areas where it has not been created
in the past

Current zoning complicates reuse in
various ways:

Affordable Housing Overlay can
provide flexibility:

Adding to the interior could require
variance for added density (FAR,
dwelling units)

Form-based approach would allow
greater density inside the existing
envelope

Additions and exterior alterations to
a non-conforming building could
require special permit or variance

Allow additions and alterations asof-right within form-based
limitations

Conversion of non-residential
building creates setback, open space
issues even if structure not changed

Existing setbacks and open space
allowed to be maintained, with
flexibility for minor alterations

Meeting parking requirements can
require significant site alterations

Parking waived when existing
building is reused

Bigelow Street: 11 affordable units approved by comprehensive permit

Additional flexibility means:

• Economics can make reuse preferable where feasible
• Options to develop while preserving significant buildings
