Business + Customer Surveys
• The Business Survey was sent out to a little over 1600 retail, restaurant, medical, financial and other service
businesses in commercial and neighborhood corridors of Cambridge the first week of July. We gave
businesses four (4) months to complete the survey. Staff followed up with over 900 businesses via email,
phone, and door to door reminders.
• The survey letter included a general information sheet about the CSO, and both were translated into
seven (7) languages. The survey was also translated upon request.
• Each business had their own unique survey link so that staff could keep track of responses.
• Businesses who did not receive the initial survey letter were also able to email staff and received their
own URL.
• Customer Transportation Survey – In July 2023, CDD surveyed customers in commercial corridors surveying
customers about mode of transit.

Study Purpose, Scope & Limitations (1)
• Purpose: Estimate the impacts of protected bicycle facilities on
retail sales, employment, and other economic variables
• Not intended as a holistic assessment of the projects (e.g., does not
analyze transportation network impacts)
• Does not include all CSO corridors, but also includes some separated
bike facilities which predate the CSO

• Focuses on comparing specific bicycle “treatment” corridors (i.e.,
streets that have either a fully separated or quick-build bike lane)
against matched “control” corridors (i.e., streets with no
separated bike lane)

Study Purpose, Scope & Limitations (2)
• Many confounding factors are present:
• Projects were installed at different times, leading to potential impacts
from broader macroeconomic trends (inflation, business cycle)
• Some installations included other changes to the roadway around the
same time (e.g., bus-only lanes, intersection redesign) and it is difficult to
separate the specific impacts of bicycle lanes
• Many bike projects overlapped with the COVID-19 Pandemic and
associated stay-at-home orders

• Separated bike lanes projects are very small in geographic scope,
requiring very fine-grained economic data to identify impacts

Selection of Treatment and Control Corridors
• Treatment corridors included those with installation of separated bike
lanes, with input from the City.

• Consideration was given to installation length and date (recency and relationship to
pandemic)
• Analysis requires both pre- and post-installation economic data, ideally with a larger number
of businesses
• Very short installations (e.g., <0.1 mi in length) were not considered

• Control corridors were identified based on input from the City as well
as comparison of economic variables and other factors (e.g., roadway
directionality)
• Controls for some analysis also included Citywide variables
• Limitations in identifying controls

• Many roadways already have bicycle facilities, just not fully separated bicycle lanes
• Business mix and roadway characteristics vary throughout the City (i.e., the City is not a grid system
with parallel and similar roadways for comparison).

Geographic Alignment
• Relevant datasets on economic variables such as employment
were identified based on the timing of corridor installation.
• Geographic information from these economic datasets was aligned
with bike lanes using a distance radius from the project (roadway
segment) of 100 yards.
• Any analytical unit (e.g., a business, a census block) was included
in a corridor if the geographic location of the unit is within the 100yard radius of the corridor.

Explored in
Study
No

Rationale

These data can be used to shed light on changes in restaurant
sales, but not on other retail sectors.

No

Lack of information on other retail sectors makes the use of this dataset as a primary
source of information insufficient. In addition, data are only available at aggregate level
from the State.

Massachusetts
Department of Revenue
meals and sales tax data

Sales and meals tax receipts are based on retailers’ own tax
documentation, can be analyzed geographically, and provide
direct evidence of changes in retail activity. Most retail activity is
covered (except for groceries and clothing).

No

The Massachusetts Department of Revenue is unable to release the data at a granular
enough level to be of use due to taxpayer privacy considerations.

Quarterly Census of
Employment and Wages
employment and wage
data

Data from reports filed by employers subject to unemployment
compensation laws, produced publicly at the city/town and
county level by NAICS industries.

No

National Establishment
Time Series
employment and sales
data

This product was established as a potential source via literature
review of past studies. Data is produced from Dun & Bradstreet
commercial/marketing data and constructed by Walls and
Associates consulting group. This is an annual series from 19902021 that is establishment location (address) based and contains
information on employment and historical sales.

No

The level of detail for publicly available data is too aggregated to be useful.
Massachusetts is a non-signatory state, indicating that projects wishing to use
establishment level data for research or other purposes are approved based on individual
state laws. Obtaining data at the establishment level would involve approvals and long
lead times. If possible, obtaining this data may be worth future consideration for any
extension of this analysis.
Data fidelity (e.g., data accuracy, completeness) could be a potential concern. There are
also concerns regarding the potential cost of the data and time lag for procurement for
this project. This dataset has been used in other studies, and may be worth future
consideration for any extension of this analysis.

Unable to find a private sector partner willing to provide such data. There would also be
key limitations, such as not providing information on cash or out-of-network transactions.

Employment Data

Food and Retail Jobs Comparison, Brattle St., Brattle Street Control
(JFK St.), and Citywide (2011-2020) (Indexed = 1 in 2011)

• LEHD dataset used ends in 2020
• Variables used: employment (total jobs), annual by
Census block
•

Sector level employment aggregated to total by defined
corridor; constructed for control(s) versus treatment

• Data are not detailed enough to allow for analysis of
causal impacts
• Qualitative examination of the corridors indicates
that there was generally little difference in
employment trends between treatment and control
corridors during the relevant time periods before
and after separated bike facility construction.

Real Estate Data
Commercial real estate values and occupancy/vacancy are a measure of the economic health of the
neighborhood and were used in some prior studies of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure investments.
• CoStar is a commercial database covering almost all commercial properties in the city, with quarterly
updates
• Available data only allows for a snapshot of business units (i.e., at a single point in time), or a time
series of historical data for a group of business units.
• Methods: t-test for comparison of means using occupancy value
• Conducted before-and-after comparison within treatment corridors, as well as comparison of the
treatment corridors against their controls, where data was available
• Data limitations:
•
•
•

Ideally, rent and occupancy information would be examined at the business unit level over time
In this case, the time series data was aggregated to the corridor level; due to the lack of transparency in the method
used to aggregate values, interpretation should be made with caution.
Even at the aggregate corridor level, data included many missing values in either rent, availability, or both. Some
corridors also simply have a limited number of properties.

• Results generally indicate that differences in commercial property within corridors and between time
periods, or between treatment and control corridors, are not substantial and may vary by location.

POI / Transaction Data
• Transaction and spending data can provide trends in the number
of customers and volume of sales over time
• SafeGraph uses a proprietary model to pair Point of Interest (POI)
data based on location-based mobile phone services data with
transaction data to generate estimates of visit and spending by
individual business location over time
• Data quality issues:

• Missing data
• Significant and unexpected variation in sales values (implausibly high and
low values)

• No conclusions could be drawn from this dataset

Business Survey (1)
• Survey data provide one source of data on changes in retail/services
sales, along with qualitative insights and information that would be
difficult to collect through other means (e.g., additional business costs
incurred)
• Attempted to mitigate response biases through effective practices such as prenotification, follow-up on nonresponse, and benchmarking of responses
• Nonetheless, survey responses are voluntary and therefore may not be
representative of all businesses

• Business Survey was sent out to retail, restaurant, medical, financial and
other service businesses in commercial and neighborhood corridors of
Cambridge
• The survey was administered beginning on July 5, 2023, and the final
responses analyzed in this report were as of September 5, 2023.
• Response rate: 17%

Summary of Findings
• Employment Data (LEHD data from the U.S. Census Bureau)
• Qualitative direct comparisons of bike lane treatment areas against control areas
and citywide averages show little to no consistent differences in retail
employment levels in the period up to 2020.

• Commercial real estate data (CoStar)
• Availability increased after bicycle lane implementation in one treatment area,
which is an indicator of a weaker rental market and retail environment, while in
another treatment area, the opposite was true, i.e., there was a decrease in
availability which would indicate a stronger market.
• Both effects were relatively small, and in all other locations, there were no
significant differences.

Summary of Findings
• SafeGraph Data

• The study team’s review of the raw data showed that there were many
unexplained inconsistencies, in addition to large sales data gaps for many
establishments.
• No conclusions could be drawn from this dataset.

• Business Survey

• Respondents in treatment areas were more likely to report a decrease in revenue
• The limited number of respondents in each treatment area hindered the ability to
examine any key differences by type of business (e.g., retail, dining, professional
services, etc.) or by location within the city.
• Although techniques including personal follow-up were applied to increase survey
response rates, the voluntary nature of the survey means that it may not be fully
representative of all affected businesses as a whole.
• Respondents in treatment corridors wanted more communication about changes.

Recommendations
Build evaluation into plans
• Define treatment and control areas with geographic precision in advance of
infrastructure projects so that data can be systematically gathered to support
analysis of transportation and local business impacts
Continue to evaluate data options, particularly for:
• Anonymized retail sales and consumer spending data and/or tax records
• Employment and wage data at finer levels of geographic detail
Expand data collection on parking (occupancy, turnover, violation rates), ideally moving
closer to real-time data collection
Continue periodic business and customer surveys to monitor trends and gather
qualitative insights

Collect more data
• Increase pre- and post-installation business and customer surveys
• Focus on corridors that are in pre-and post-installation instead of citywide
will help us with gathering more specific geographic data
• Reach out to the state to see if any tax data could be shared

• Research other POI or other third-party data sources

Collect more data: Parking Utilization
• Planning for pre-and post- installation parking occupancy studies for all upcoming
CSO Separated Bike Lane corridors.
• Past studies have required manual data collection of parking occupancy.
• Exploring technology solutions that will allow for easier occupancy data
collection, resulting in the opportunity to collect more data. Technology solutions
still require significant manual processing.
• Exploring pre- and post- count options for all various modes to supplement
existing bi-annual bicycle counts.
• Count technology for pedestrians and bicycles is less advanced than vehicle
count technology.

Increasing Communications & Mitigation Efforts
• DPW, TPT, and CDD staff meet with individual businesses to discuss concerns
and go over project design and possible direct impacts. So far, city staff have met
with approximately 100 businesses before, during, and after bike installation on
separated bike facilities, including projects like Mass. Ave. Partial Build and
Hampshire St.

• Develop post-installation marketing and communication support for CSO
commercial corridors and districts
• TPT is working on improving signage around parking and delivery along Mass. Ave.
to ensure visitors understand the new parking options – model for other corridors

Increasing Communications & Mitigation Efforts
• Create guidance and programs to help customers and employees get to the area
by all transportation modes
• Develop parking and transit maps (print and digital) for businesses to place on their website
and have at their place of business to share with customers
• Improve information on reduced Bluebike and & T fare programs
• Improve information on shuttles available to the public e.g. Harvard free shuttle program, EZ
Ride

• Update zoning and PTDM policies to allow for flexibility for use of off-street
parking lots and spaces in areas where parking spaces are lost as a result of CSO
implementation

Re:

Cycling Safety Ordinance Economic Impact Study

Please find attached the Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) Economic Impact
Report. Additional information on this study, including this full report is available
at www.cambridgema.gov/econimpactstudy.
BACKGROUND
In 2022, the City Council requested that the Community Development
Department’s Economic Opportunity and Development Division study the impact
of installation of separated bike facilities along commercial corridors on local
businesses, positive or negative, with the goal to help inform current and future
installations of bike lanes.
The City entered into an inter-agency agreement with Volpe National
Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) in January 2023 to conduct the study. The
study scope includes identifying and collecting relevant economic data to create
a baseline and evaluate impacts of installations to date and creating a
methodology that can also be used for analysis and reporting in future years as
the bike network is implemented. The initial steps of the work included
reviewing similar studies from other cities to identify best practices in
methodology and potential data sources. The goal was to create a sustainable
data set that includes objective, local data that is available and can be updated
on a consistent basis.

Finding reliable data sources was a challenge. Studies from other
communities used data sources not available locally in Cambridge (e.g.
local sales tax). Data from third party organizations (such as Safegraph)
was also found unreliable because it was missing local data for many
quarters. Data used and recommended for future reporting includes
customer and business surveys, commercial real estate

occupancy/vacancy data, and Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics (LEHD) employment data.
The study’s findings of impacts are inconclusive. The retail and small
business environment in 2023, and the preceding years while the
separated bike facilities were being installed, was deeply influenced by
macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, high
interest rates, supply chain issues, and increase in online shopping. This
makes it difficult to determine what component of economic impact
being experienced by businesses are attributable to separated bike
facilities and what is the impact of broader macroeconomic factors.
Looking at the quantitative data, the study found little to no difference
between an area with a separated bike lane and a similar area without
one. If there are differences, they are not statistically significant.
We conducted a business survey and got responses from 300 businesses,
a 20% response rate. The business survey results qualitatively showed
that in separated bike lane corridors some businesses saw a decrease in
sales since installation.

NEXT STEPS
It is important to continue to collect data to understand short- or long-term
economic impacts due to the separated bike lane installation. We intend to
utilize the blueprint created by Volpe to analyze and report findings until the
bicycle network installation required by the CSO is complete.
City staff have already found the study recommendations useful for improving
future data sets and reporting. Specifically, we will conduct customer intercept
surveys more frequently and clarify the business survey questions to ask about
impacts explicitly around fully separated bike lanes and not street changes in
general. CDD staff will work with the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
Department to gather and use parking utilization data pre- and post-installation
of separated bike facilities.
The CSO Economic Impact Study brings together quantitative and qualitative
data, and we expect that this will provide a shared understanding as a starting
point to help City staff communicate better with the business community. It will
also help us understand current on-street business impacts and which mitigation
efforts are the most effective.

Introduction
The Cambridge City Council passed the Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) 1 in 2019, requiring installation of
separated facilities along the portion of the network designated for greater separation in the Cambridge
Bicycle Network Vision. 2 In 2020, the ordinance was amended to establish a more specific timeframe for
installing approximately 25 miles of separated bicycle lanes within the city. As of 2023, just under 10
miles of separated bike lanes have been installed 3 since May 1, 2020, in addition to other bicycle
facilities that were developed prior to the CSO. An expanded network of protected bike lanes has been
associated with rising numbers of bike trips made in the city and a downward trend in injury rates. 4 At
the same time, the installation of separated bicycle facilities in commercial corridors has raised concerns
among some stakeholders about the associated loss of parking and loading spaces and potential impacts
on retail trade and other businesses.
This study was conducted by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center under an Inter-Agency
Agreement with the City of Cambridge. It uses a mixed-methods approach, i.e., with both quantitative
and qualitative data, to assess the impacts of protected bicycle lane infrastructure projects in Cambridge
on retail sales and overall neighborhood economic vitality. It includes a review of existing published
literature and prior studies on this topic; a summary of the study methodology; and an analysis of
available data across multiples sources and datasets, including Census data on employment and income,
commercial databases covering real estate and retail sales, and survey responses from local business
owners and customers. In the final section, the findings are distilled into a set of overall conclusions and
suggestions for future studies.
In addition to formal data analysis, stakeholder feedback was an important component of this study. The
City has maintained a website with updated information, including the study’s statement of work,
background information on the CSO, interim deliverables, and status updates. 5 In addition, both City
staff and members of the Volpe Center team attended public meetings to share updates on progress,
receive feedback and suggestions from stakeholders, and answer questions. These included a public
information session on July 17, 2023, and meetings of the City Council’s Committee on Economic
Development and University Relations on May 2, 2023, and July 20, 2023. City staff also provided a brief
update to a meeting of the Cambridge business associations on March 14, 2023, and the CSO Advisory

Committee on September 26, 2023.
Through public meetings and other channels of feedback, suggestions were provided by City Council
members, interested residents, and business owners. In particular, feedback was received regarding
available data sources and past studies. Relevant feedback was incorporated where possible, including
exploration of potential data sources and review of publicly available past studies regarding the
economic impacts of bicycle facilities, where possible.

1.1 Scope and Terminology
This study is focused primarily on financial and economic impacts and is not intended as a holistic
assessment of investments in protected bicycle facilities. Notably, the study does not directly address
safety outcomes, user satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, or broader impacts on travel behavior, mode
choice, or operations of the transportation system, though some of these aspects are covered in the
published literature that was reviewed. Although the CSO is often referenced, the study includes some
separated bike facilities which predate the CSO and does not include all CSO corridors. In addition, much
of the study focuses on comparing specific bicycle “treatment” corridors (i.e., streets that have either a
fully separated or quick build bike lane) against matched “control” corridors (i.e., streets with no
separated bike lane), so not all bike corridors in the city are addressed at the same level of detail.
Many different terms can be used to refer to on-street bicycle facilities. For simplicity, this report
generally uses the term “protected” or “separated” bike lane, to refer to bicycle lanes that are physically
separated from traffic using flexible bollards or similar devices.

Past Studies
Several studies, both in and outside the United States, have been conducted regarding the installation of
safe and complete street measures such as separated bike lanes and impacts on economic measures at
nearby businesses, such as employment and retail sales. Each study uses different data and
methodology to assess the economic impact of changes in roadway composition including but not
limited to the installation of bike lanes and removal of parking. 6

2.1 New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT):
The Economic Benefits of Sustainable Streets7
This project demonstrates methods for comparing economic data using several case studies in New York
City which include bicycle improvements among other safe and complete street measures such as busrelated improvements and traffic calming. The primary data source used for analysis is city sales tax
filings. The study also uses limited commercial lease and rent and city-assessed market value data,
noting limited availability of the lease and rent data and difficulty obtaining its historical data. The retail
sales tax filing data is noted to be a strong data source because of its availability at the individual
business level. Another advantage of tax data is that it is universal and does not rely on voluntary
collection. However, a disadvantage of these data noted is privacy restrictions. This study also considers
but does not use other datasets including real estate transaction data, business establishment creation
or loss, employment, and building permit information. The study specifically excludes addresses not
located on the ground floor, to eliminate the potential for other filing addresses such as apartments or
office buildings in the study area.
Each neighborhood case study in the analysis notes the before and after context of the area and the
goals of improvements. The analysis uses seven case study areas and compares economic data to both
comparison areas and the entire borough as controls. Comparisons are made pre-construction (i.e., a
baseline period), during construction, and post construction. Comparison areas were selected in two
ways: large areas (i.e., the borough in which the project is located), and comparison sites which were
based either on similar retail mix within a neighborhood or sites with similar street characteristics.
Where possible, multiple comparison sites were identified.
This study finds that sales increase after construction, however, not in a substantially different way than
controls for most case studies. In some cases, the improvement area overperformed comparison areas,
and in others the comparison sites overperformed the improvement area or saw similar changes.

2.2 Bloor Street West Bike Lane Pilot Project Evaluation8
This study summarizes findings using before and after data for a pilot bike corridor in Toronto, Ontario,
including impacts on cycling volumes, traffic volumes, travel times, safety, parking and curbside
demands, local businesses, and public perception. To assess curbside impacts including parking, site
visits occurred on a by-request basis to review issues with loading. The study notes that some
businesses had access to other delivery locations (e.g., rear of building) and some adjusted delivery
schedules. Loading zones were established as a result of stakeholder engagement. In the study area,
parking was reduced from both sides of the street to one side of the street only, with extended hours.
Total paid parking spots were reduced by 10%.
To assess impacts on businesses, the study included both a survey of merchants and a pedestrian
intercept survey. The merchant survey included both the study corridor and a control area. The
merchant survey reported on changes in the number of customers. The pedestrian survey included
frequency of visits, monthly spending, mode of transportation, and parking difficulties (where
applicable). The study also examined vacancy rates over time and point-of-sale data for the study
corridor, the surrounding area as a control, a control area/district with similar characteristics, and a
control area which includes all businesses in the city of Toronto. Data for the year prior to the pilot and
the year of the pilot were compared.
This study finds that total vehicle parking was reduced by approximately 6%. During peak times, the
study found that usage of parking exceeded 85% of capacity, indicating difficulty finding parking.
Minimal impacts were observed on side streets. Merchants in both the control and the study area saw a
growth in the number of customers, with smaller growth noted in the study area. Visitors reported more
visits after the installation, compared to no changes in the control area. Visitor-reported monthly
spending increased at a similar rate in the study and control areas. Visitors reported increased difficulty
in parking at similar rates in both the study and control areas. Vacancy rates were steady in the study
area and declined in the control area by a small amount. Overall transactional volume growth was seen
in the pilot study area and across all control areas. Per-transaction size declined in the study area and in
all controls.

2.3 Understanding Economic and Business Impacts of Street
Improvements for Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility9
This study summarizes findings which compare four types of economic data and three different
analytical approaches which are used to evaluate the impact of street improvements on economic
variables such as sales or employment. The study uses four data sources: annual Census Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics data for number of jobs at the Census block level, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data at the establishment level, National Employment Time Series at the
establishment level, and retail sales tax data at the establishment level.
The study identifies treatment and control corridors. The authors note that identifying treatment and
control corridors can be data-driven or be guided by local experts. The study notes that obtaining
enough data for a data-driven approach can be difficult and uses a combined approach which has local
experts identify corridors and then validates those areas using available data. To evaluate economic
impacts, the study uses three econometric approaches. These are aggregated trend analysis (similar to
the NYCDOT study), difference-in-difference analysis, and interrupted time series analysis. These
methods are applied to case studies in Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, Minneapolis, MN, and Memphis,
TN. Findings were generally that street improvements have positive or nonsignificant impacts.
The study also compares the different data sources and analysis methods used, and notes that tradeoffs
exist between ease of interpretability and econometric rigor. Methods with more econometric rigor and
which may allow for causal inference, 10 have data restrictions which make their applicability in other
studies contingent on data availability. 11

For a detailed discussion, see, for example, Joshua D. Angrist and Jorn-Steffen Pischke, Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An
Empiricist’s Companion (Princeton University Press, 2009).

10

The authors explore three types of analysis. Aggregate trend analysis, as noted by the authors, is valuable because of ease of
interpretability, but lacks econometric rigor which would allow for causal inference. The authors examine both absolute and
indexed values. Difference-in-difference analysis estimates difference in the variables of interest pre- and post- improvement
between treatment and control corridors. This type of analysis requires panel or cross-sectional data for the treatment and
control corridors, with the assumption that absent the intervention (in this case, bicycle facilities), the difference in trends
between the corridors would remain constant. This type of analysis allows for causal inference. Finally, interrupted time series
analysis examines the trends in the variable of interest before and after the intervention, through either a change in the
intercept or a change in the slope in the post intervention period, relative to the pre-intervention period. The authors note that
this type of analysis requires a longer time series, both pre- and post-intervention, but has advantages due to the fact that it
does not rely on control corridors.

2.4 Bicycle Infrastructure and Commercial District Change12
This study examines impacts of bicycle infrastructure on businesses by using secondary data on business
performance in the San Francisco Bay Area. This study also involved an intercept survey of customers in
paired corridors to examine mode choice and consumer behavior, where pairs were determined based
on business density and mix, as well as population demographic and mode choice characteristics. The
study examines the impacts of several types of bicycle facilities, notably Class II (dedicated bike lanes)
and Class III facilities (shared roadways). However, Class IV facilities, separated bicycle lanes, were
indistinguishable in the underlying data used by the study from Class II facilities (dedicated bicycle
lanes), and were excluded from analysis in the study.
The study uses the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database, and notes that drawbacks to
this data source include potential inaccuracy of data and infrequency of updates. The variables
examined were sales, employees, location, industry, and the years at the location. In order to designate
relevant businesses for the study ArcGIS was used to draw a 100-foot buffer to capture businesses
which abut bicycle facilities.
Variables examined by the authors included business performance in the form of sales and business
turnover. For sales, before and after installation averages were calculated. For business turnover, the
probability of a business closing was calculated. Other variables used included roadway characteristics
and demographic information for the surrounding neighborhood.
The results of the study regarding impacts of facilities were not conclusive, and varied by roadway type
and business type. The authors state that the facilities have a “generally mixed effect” on sales at the
business level.

Review of Available Data Sources
Based on the literature review and research regarding available data sources, a variety of datasets were
considered for analysis. These datasets include data related to economic factors such as commercial
rental rates, employment levels, sales, and business vacancies, as well as data related to transportation
activity such as pedestrian and bike counts. To supplement available third-party datasets, business and
pedestrian intercept surveys were also conducted by the city. A summary of datasets used is shown in
Table 1, and a summary of datasets which were considered but determined not to be useful and/or
available are shown in Table 2.
While economic data related directly to sales such as sales transaction data or sales tax data at the
quarterly level would be the preferred data source for analysis, sources for these types of data are not
readily available from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and from businesses owners directly. After
reviewing available data, point of interest (POI) transaction data, Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics employment data and commercial real estate data on rental rates and vacancies were
explored as the basis for analysis, with supplemental data from the City of Cambridge. In addition, a
survey of businesses was conducted by the City of Cambridge, and the City also conducted a pedestrian
intercept survey. The datasets described were combined using geographic information, as described in
Section 4.2.

used to analyze employment by census
block.

Yes

Due to data privacy, obtaining access to
LEHD at a level with more granularity than
the census block level would involve long
lead times. Data at the census block level
does not allow the level of detail necessary
to identify businesses facing a particular
roadway improvement. However, census
blocks can be assigned to a corridor based
on a radius from the roadway. Data at the
annual level is more aggregated than
would be preferred and does not allow for
precise measurement of changes in
employment relative to the completion
date of a project.
Employment levels tend to be a lagging
and indirect indicator of changes in retail
activity but may be used to validate control
areas where sufficient data are available.
These data are available in 2011 through
2020 at the time of analysis, but sufficient
data is not available for more recent
installations.
This dataset is useful in identifying existing
trends in employment for census blocks
near specific bike corridors compared to a
control area.

Parking information

Parking availability information or
studies are limited in availability.
Notably, one study was conducted in
the area of the Brattle Street corridor
(after installation only, conducted in
2018) 13 and the mid-Cambridge Street
corridor (before and after
installation). 14

Data Source

Description of Source and Potential
Relationship to Study

Explored
in Study

Rationale

Sidewalk and inperson customer
intercept surveys

City-collected survey data from
shopper intercepts at bike project
locations and controls. These data
provide information on mode of travel
and purpose of trip.

Yes

These data sets do not provide direct
evidence of changes in business sales but
allow other information to be viewed in
context.

Business surveys

City-collected data from surveys of
business owners in affected locations
versus control groups. This will provide
information on changes in retail activity
relative to a pre-COVID baseline.

Yes

Because the survey is voluntary and the
recent or planned bicycle facility projects
are public in nature, there are several
sources of potential bias including
nonresponse bias.
In addition, many macro- and microeconomic factors other than bike projects
can affect sales volumes. Nonetheless, the
survey data, as a supplement to other data
sources, will provide a direct source of
information on changes in the business
environment in addition to information
regarding perceived impacts.

Commercial real
estate lease rate
and/or
occupancy/vacancy
data

Private sector providers such as CoStar
estimate rental rates and vacancy rates
for commercial properties. Data on
properties near bike projects can be
compared to a control group. 15

Yes

Because the value of urban real estate
hinges on the commercial desirability of its
location, changes in rents can provide a
useful indirect measure of changes in retail
activity and overall accessibility.
Occupancy/ vacancy data also provide a
secondary measure.
These datasets are credible as they are
used widely in the real estate industry, and
they permit geographic analysis. Although
property values are also available through
the city assessor, these involve longer time
lags, and the assessment methodology
may not account for smaller changes in
neighborhood access.
Use of data is dependent on availability for
identified corridors, and some data review
and cleaning will be necessary to permit
analysis.

As noted above, the City collects data on ground floor business vacancies, which includes business information and length of
vacancy. However, the level of granularity for the length of vacancies varies.

Rationale

Point of interest (POI)
transaction data

Information from electronic
transactions can be purchased from a
POI data company such as SafeGraph.

Yes

POI transaction data provides anonymized
credit and debit card transaction
information which can be used to track
local sales trends directly. Use of this data
required a purchase of the dataset. Key
limitations are the exclusion of non-credit
card transactions, and the lack of
transparency regarding potential gaps in
the data. The earliest available data is from
2019.
The data contains primarily full-service
restaurants, snack and nonalcoholic
beverage bars, limited-service restaurants,
hair/nail/skin care services, and fitness
centers. The dataset includes both chain
and independent businesses at the store
level by month. Variables of interest are
total sales amount, spending per customer,
number of transactions, or number of
customers.

Bike lane information

Geographic and time information
regarding bike lane installation

Yes

Assessing bike lane impacts requires
location and timing information for
impacted corridors.

The level of detail for publicly available
data is too aggregated to be useful.
Massachusetts is a non-signatory state,
indicating that projects wishing to use
establishment level data for research or
other purposes are approved based on
individual state laws. Obtaining data at
the establishment level would involve

Methodology
To assess the economic impacts of bike lanes in the City of Cambridge, control (i.e., areas without
separated bike lane installation) and treatment (i.e., areas with separated bike lane installation)
corridors were identified. Treatment corridors were identified through several criteria including the
installation of separated bicycle facilities, corridor length, bicycle facility installation date, and input
from the City. The corridor length is an important factor to consider in order to estimate any economic
impact. Some installations identified in a review of past projects were over a very small geographic area
(e.g., less than 0.1 miles), which would make analysis difficult. Similarly, the corridor installation date is
an important factor to consider. Corridors which were installed quite recently would not have sufficient
data to assess any economic variables in the corridor post-installation. Depending on the timing of a
bike lane installation, these impacts may not be separable from COVID-19 impacts (e.g., any bike lane
which was completed in 2020), so the timing of installation was also considered relative to the
pandemic.
Control corridors were identified based on input from the City as well as comparison of economic and
other variables (e.g., employment mix). Controls for some analysis also included Citywide variables, in
particular employment. Identifying corridor location and parameters as well as construction start, and
end dates is essential for identifying any potential economic impacts. Changes to the roadway outside of
bicycle lane installation such as bus lane installation or other roadway construction were identified. It
may not be possible to separate any impacts of bicycle lane installation from other roadway changes if
they occurred at the same time or in subsequent periods.
Controls were generally identified through one of three methods:
•
•
•

Citywide trends,
Nearby corridors (e.g., surrounding area), or
Comparable corridors (e.g., business size/industry mix and traffic flows are similar)

4.1 Dataset Construction and Corridor Definition
In order to identify treatment corridors for this analysis, several factors were considered including the
installation of separated bike lanes, the directionality (one or both directions) of the bicycle facility
installation, the length of the installation, and the completion date of the installation. Additional input
was provided by the City regarding corridors of interest. The selected corridors, a description of their
approximate location, the length of the corridor, and the completion date, are included in Table 3. It
should be noted that the corridors defined in this study cover only a portion of the total bicycle facilities
currently constructed and planned under the CSO.

Identifying control corridors presents difficulties, particularly given the geography of Cambridge. The
city does not follow a grid system, so, for example, identifying a similar parallel roadway that did not
receive a separated bicycle facility installation is often not possible. To identify control corridors given
Cambridge’s roadway system characteristics, several factors were considered, including proximity to the
treatment corridor and business mix relative to the treatment corridor. 22 It is a requirement that control
corridors did not have a separated bicycle facility installation during the study time period. However,
some control corridors do have planned separated bicycle facility installations at a future date. Other
considerations, where possible, included the roadway characteristics (e.g., one way, two-way). The list

Both business mix and proximity would be preferable. However, for corridors such as Cambridge St. – Quincy/Fayette, finding
a comparable business mix and proximity was difficult due to the presence of a hospital in the corridor.

confounding to analysis include roadway features which may be specific to a corridor, and in some cases
included roadway construction. Examples include the extended construction beginning in 2012 on

4.2 Geographic Alignment of Datasets
Geographic information from the datasets was aligned with bike lanes using a distance radius from the
project (roadway segment) of 100 yards, as shown in Figure 1 for treatment corridors. 23 The buffer was
made using the QGIS Geographic Information System software. Control corridors were defined
geographically in a similar way, using a radius of 100 yards, as shown in Figure 2. Based on the
information available and the construction start and end dates, appropriate datasets of economic
variables were identified.

To define the corridors geographically based on their definitions in Section 3.1, a QGIS Geographic Information System layer
was created with the approximate bicycle facility locations overlayed on the relevant roadway.

Where possible, trend analysis was conducted to assess whether the impacted areas have seen
differentiated economic impacts after the installation of a bike lane relative to the identified control(s).
Comparison of treatment corridors and control corridors was conducted using available data which
assesses the following:
•

Whether parking was impacted relative to the control(s). Ideally, detailed parking information
such as available spaces by type (e.g., metered) and loading zones, and occupancy, would be
examined before and after the installation of separated bicycle facilities. However, detailed
post-installation parking information was only available for some corridors. Other parking
comparison, aside from review of existing parking studies, was not possible given available
information.
o The Brattle Street On-Street Parking Study 24 was designed to provide information
regarding parking occupancy only after the installation of a separated bicycle facility.
The study examines parking in the study area overall, on Brattle Street, Streets North of
Brattle Street, and Streets South of Brattle Street in March 2018 (post-installation). It
should be noted that the geographic area analyzed in this study does not align to the
study corridor buffer of 100 yards defined for this report. Considering parking on Brattle
Street only, the study finds that only on Brattle Street, few unoccupied spaces were
observed in the study, with occupancy exceeding 95 percent, while occupancy varies on
surrounding roadways in the study area and is generally lower than on Brattle Street.
o The Cambridge Street On-street Parking Study 25 examined both pre-installation and
post-installation parking. The existing supply of 1065 spaces was proposed to be cut to
971, a removal of 94 spaces in the study area. The study examined parking in the study
area overall, on Cambridge Street, Streets North of Cambridge Street, and Streets South
of Cambridge Street in 2017 (pre-installation) and 2018 (post-installation). It should be
noted that the study radius does not align to the study corridor radius of 100 yards
defined for this report. The study finds that the 2018 parking demand is met by available
spaces.
o The Western Ave. Post-Construction Evaluation 26 includes parking utilization
information for the Western Ave. corridor. However, this corridor includes many other
features beyond the installation of separated bicycle facilities, notably curb extensions.
Parking spaces were reduced from 133 to 108 in the study area on Western Ave.

Whether economic variables such as sales, employment, vacancy, or rents changed relative to
the control(s), and
Comparison of survey responses relative to the control(s).

Given the lack of one universally available dataset for analysis, analysis varies depending on the corridor
identified and the timeline of the installation. For example, for a more recent installation, POI
transaction data was available, while for older installations, employment or real estate data were the
only available data sources. Where possible, multiple datasets were used.
Using the 100-yard radius defined above, economic data was aligned with corridors. This was possible
for several datasets, including the LEHD data, SafeGraph data, and business survey results. 27 While the
geographic units of each dataset varied – LEHD data is at the Census Block level, while SafeGraph and
business survey data are at the individual business level -the process for geographic definition was the
same. Any unit (e.g., business, census block) was considered to be included in a corridor if the
geographic location of the unit is within the 100-yard radius of the corridor. Results of this alignment at
the Census Block level are shown in Figure 3 for the three pre-2019 treatment corridors and their
respective control corridors. Census Blocks are not uniform in size or shape, as is seen in the figure, and
Blocks were included in a corridor only if a portion of the Block was inside the 100-yard radius. 28 When
aligning the LEHD data with the corridors, block geometries from the 2020 Census were used. The
SafeGraph data were aligned with the corridors using the geographic coordinates provided. The business
survey results were aligned with the corridors by geocoding the business addresses (i.e., converting the
street addresses to geographic coordinates) using the Open Street Map/Nominatum web service in the
QGIS Geographic Information System software. 29 For both the SafeGraph data and the business survey,
businesses were included in a corridor if the geographic coordinate was inside the 100-yard radius.

CoStar data was extracted using a built-in online tool. Given that the online tool requires manual polygon definition, radii
used may not be an exact match for corridors defined in Section 3.2.

27

For a small number of census blocks (n=5), the corridor definitions and 100-yard radius used resulted in blocks being assigned
to multiple corridors. In these cases, manual review was required to determine the assignment of the block to a corridor. In the
case where an overlap was assigned between a treatment and control corridor, the block was assigned to the treatment
corridor. In the case where the block was assigned to more than one corridor of the same type (e.g., multiple control corridors),
the block was reviewed visually using a map to determine appropriate corridor assignment based on relative proximity and
block shape.

28

The street addresses reported in the business survey data were adjusted to improve the accuracy of the geocoding. The types
of changes made included using proper cases (only capitalizing the first letter), removing unit designations (e.g., suite #2),
correcting or completing spelling errors (replacing “Mass Ave” with “Massachusetts Ave”), consistently labeling the street type
(e.g., using Ave, St, and Blvd).

Analysis
5.1 Corridor Analysis Using the Longitudinal EmployerHousehold Dynamics Data30
As noted in the Section 1 and Section 3, data on employment and income levels can be used as a proxy
for retail sales and overall neighborhood vitality in the context of bicycle facility construction.
The Census Bureau develops and maintains the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
program to provide public-use data on employer and employee workforce dynamics. 31 While several
data options are available for researchers, the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
were used for this study to measure employment trends in predefined protected bike lane treatment
corridors against control corridors and citywide and regional averages. Specifically, the LODES
Workplace Area Characteristics contains information at the Census Block level on total jobs, the number
of workers by age and income cohorts, and number of jobs by NAICS sector, in addition to other
demographic data. Data is available for public use for most states from 2002 through 2020 at an annual
level (Massachusetts data is available from 2011 through 2020).
In this analysis, Census Block level GIS shapefiles were aligned and grouped with the bike lane and
treatment corridors of interest, using corridor definitions as defined in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 32
Census Blocks are not uniform in size or shape, and Blocks were considered to be included in a corridor
only if a portion of the Block was inside the designated corridor radius (see Figure 3). 33
The primary use of this data is centered on pre-2019 bike lane construction. This was required given that
data is only available through 2020 and enough observations pre- and post-construction are needed to
determine and analyze trends. Table 5 details the LODES data considered, data properties and notes of
data transformation.

For pre-2019 bike lanes, these control corridors are defined as follows: the control corridor for Brattle – Mason/Eliot is JFK St.
from approximately South St. to Memorial Dr., the control corridor for Cambridge St. – Quincy/Fayette is Mt. Auburn St. from
approximately Gerrys Landing Rd. to Longfellow Park, and the control Corridor for Western Ave. is Pearl St. from approximately
Granite St. to Green St.

32

For a small number of census blocks (n=5), the corridor definitions and 100-yard radius used resulted in blocks being assigned
to multiple corridors. In these cases, manual review was required to determine the assignment of the block to a corridor. In the
case where an overlap was assigned between a treatment and control corridor, the block was assigned to the treatment
corridor. In the case where the block was assigned to more than one corridor of the same type (e.g., multiple control corridors),
the block was reviewed visually using a map to determine appropriate corridor assignment based on relative proximity and
block shape.

However, challenges existed with the initial set of data considered, and ultimately the focus of the
analysis centered on food and retail sector employment. 34 One key challenge is that the public LODES
employment data are aggregated at a level that makes it difficult to identify trends, particularly with the
retail and food sectors that are of greatest interest, as these make up a relatively small share of total
employment. Figure 4 presents the sector level employment in the city of Cambridge from 2011-2020,
which shows retail, and food and entertainment services making up roughly 12% of total employment in
2019, 35 while educational and professional services making up the majority of employment (60%).
Additionally, while the distribution of employment was an important second order consideration when
identifying potential control corridors, it was not directly relevant to the analysis of trends pre- and
For the purposes of this analysis, this includes jobs in NAICS sectors 44-45 (Retail Trade), NAICS sector 71 (Arts, Entertainment
and Recreation), and NAICS sector 72 (Accommodation and Food Services).

34

Retail, and food and entertainment sector jobs accounted for approximately 15% of jobs in 2012, and 8% of jobs in 2020,
while educational and professional services accounted for 52% of jobs in 2012, and 64% of jobs in 2020.

post-construction of bike lanes. Finally, consideration of monthly earnings presented data limitations as
the ranges used in public data are too broad to draw any conclusion of wage trends or impacts.
Figure 4. City of Cambridge Sector Level Employment from 2011-2020 36

Additional findings on Cambridge-wide job trends for food and retail were included to complement the
trends for each treatment and control corridor as shown in Figure 4, discussed above, in Figure 5, which
shows total job trends in Cambridge versus all other areas in the surrounding Boston-CambridgeNewton, MA area, and in Figure 6, which shows food and retail job trends in Cambridge versus all other
areas in the surrounding Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA area. 37 Total job trends, indexed to 2011, are
increasing in both Cambridge and the surrounding area in all years except 2020, with steeper increases
seen in Cambridge. However, food and retail jobs in Cambridge versus the surrounding area show a
flatter trend than the surrounding area and show declines beginning in 2019.

As noted in Section 4.1, the following three treatment and control corridors were considered using the
LODES data and are presented below: Brattle St., Cambridge St. – Quincy/Fayette, and Western Ave. The
comparisons made between treatment and controls should be considered qualitative and do not
support direct causal inferences. The reasons why are twofold: firstly, the time related restrictions of
annual data may obscure the treatment effects or trends post-bike lane construction. Depending on the
length and timing of the bike lane construction, any potential impacts could be difficult to detect when
examined at an annual level. Secondly, any causal link and measurable impact from the construction of

bike lanes on corridor level employment would need to be addressed with the appropriate statistical
methods for causal analysis under pseudo-experimental controls (e.g., difference-in-difference
regression analysis). This is not possible given the aforementioned geographic and temporal data
aggregation. With these limitations in mind, qualitative examination of the corridors indicates that there
was generally little difference in employment trends between treatment and control corridors during
the relevant time periods before and after bike facility construction. More detailed information on each
corridor follows below.

The food and retail job numbers for the Brattle St. treatment and control corridors are presented in
Figure 7. The corridors have slightly diverging trends through 2015/2016, where job growth is relatively
flat in the control corridor and increasing for the treatment corridor before trending slightly downwards
leading up to the construction of the bike lane in 2017. Both corridors see a decrease in jobs during the
post-construction period. The effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns had
roughly the same impact on food and retail jobs between the treatment and control corridors, both
losing approximately 50% of jobs.
Figure 8 includes the Cambridge citywide index of food and retail jobs and indexes the job totals to 2011
values for comparison against the treatment and control corridors. The difference in job growth trends
pre- and post-bike lane construction is minimal when compared against the citywide index, and confirms
the decrease observed in the control corridor from 2016-2019. Taken together, the comparison in
trends point towards no noticeable impact on food and retail jobs from the construction of the
separated bike lane relative to either the control corridor or citywide.

5.1.2 Cambridge St. – Quincy/Fayette
A comparison of food and retail jobs for the Cambridge St. treatment and control corridors is presented
in Figure 9 and a Cambridge citywide comparison is presented in Figure 10. As noted in Section 4.1,
defining a control corridor was challenging given the distribution of jobs of the surrounding blocks and
neighborhoods are predominately health services, particularly jobs in a hospital in the project area
(which would be less likely to be affected by any bike lane construction). Given the very small number of
jobs represented in the food, retail, and entertainment sectors in the treatment and control corridors,
graphs should be interpreted with caution. The resulting control has fewer total food and retail jobs
relative to treatment corridor with noisier trends given its limited size. The trends in the treatment
corridor show job growth from 2016 through the construction of the bike lane in 2017 and 2018. From
2018 to 2019 job growth was flat before declining sharply due to the pandemic. When compared to the
citywide trends (Figure 10), the treatment and control corridors saw above average growth in jobs
through the bike lane construction period and a similar pause in growth from 2018 to 2019. Overall, the
trend in job growth appears unchanged in the treatment corridor after the construction of the bike
when compared against either control or citywide measures.

5.1.3 Western Ave.
Figure 11 and Figure 12 present the comparison of food and retail job trends for Western Ave. against
the control corridor and Cambridge citywide index, respectively. Given the very small number of jobs
represented in the food, retail, and entertainment sectors in the treatment corridor, graphs should be
interpreted with caution. The treatment and control corridor show a difference in the overall trends,
with the control increasing throughout the period examined, while the treatment sees some job growth
prior to construction of the bike lane, but a decrease in jobs prior to and after construction in 2015
through 2018 before remaining flat from 2018 to 2020. When compared to the citywide index, the
treatment corridor’s decline in jobs can be seen beginning in 2015, with the steepest reduction in 2016
to 2017. No hard conclusion can be drawn from the differences in trends; however, the employment
data points to some job loss post- construction in the food and retail sectors, but the declining trend in
jobs in those sectors began prior to bike lane construction. It should be noted that “major utility
reconstruction” on this project began in September 2012, with final paving and painting occurring in the
second half of 2015 through early 2016, which is considered to be the bike lane implementation
period. 38

5.2 SafeGraph Point of Interest Consumer Data Considerations
5.2.1 Data Source and Variables
Another approach to analyzing the effects of protected bike facilities on retail sales is with locationbased estimates of transaction volume. Point of Interest (POI) consumer sales data compiled by
SafeGraph was purchased by the study team for potential analysis. The sales data is estimated for
individual establishments at the monthly level from January 2019 through March 2023. SafeGraph uses
a proprietary process to aggregate transaction data to the point of interest (establishment) level. 39
In theory, the POI sales data should be a reasonable proxy to measure the overall economic health of
commercial sections or corridors of the city. Establishment level sales data was readily mapped to
corridors that received a separated bike lane during this period (treatment) and to identified control
corridors (see Section 4.1 on corridor definition) using latitude and longitude information in the
SafeGraph data, as well as business address information. SafeGraph also provided a state-specific
expansion factor that was used to translate the unadjusted SafeGraph observations into estimates of
actual retail sales volume, i.e., adjusting for the fact that the size of SafeGraph’s sample varies over time.

5.2.2 Data Quality
An initial review of the list of retail and restaurant establishments found reasonable coverage city-wide;
however, issues were apparent in both the quality of the sales data and the coverage at the monthly
and quarterly level for individual establishments. Significant and unexpected variation in the sales data
exists at the establishment level, making both the absolute value and rate of change questionable. In
one instance, sales data for a restaurant increased by over 100-fold for two quarters before coming back
to its previous average quarterly value, which is unlikely to be explained by any real-world phenomenon.
The other major concern is the lack of data coverage at the monthly/quarterly level. Given that the data
is monthly in its initial level of aggregation, one missing quarter indicates no data recorded in three
consecutive months in the dataset. For example, a corridor of interest had 88 identified establishments,
but 15 of them had only a single non-missing quarterly observation over the entire time series (Q1/2019
– Q3/2023, or 17 quarters). Moreover, over half the establishments had 3 or more missing quarterly
data points, making the dataset unsuitable for discernment of trends using typical statistical techniques.
The issues of missing data and data variation are clearly linked in the underlying data generation
process, making any inference in high level trends or other more sophisticated modeling efforts (e.g.,
difference-in-difference regression analysis10) invalid. Details regarding the data coverage are shown in
Table 6 for an example corridor (Mass Ave. – Roseland/Beech).

5.2.3 Conclusions
Overall, unexplained inconsistencies in the data including a large number of missing observations and
implausibly high and low values make this dataset unsuitable for any statistical analysis at the
geographic level required for this study. As such, no conclusions can be drawn from this dataset.

5.3 Exploration of CoStar Data
CoStar Group is a company that provides commercial real estate information and analytics for real
estate transactions (sales and leasing). Private sector providers such as CoStar 40 estimate rental rates
and availability rates for commercial properties. 41 Commercial real estate lease rate and/or
occupancy/availability data is useful for providing additional context regarding the commercial
desirability of corridor locations. Because the value of urban real estate hinges on the commercial
desirability of its location, changes in rents can provide a useful indirect measure of changes in retail
activity and overall accessibility. Occupancy and availability data also provide a secondary measure, if
the market rents fall below a tenant’s current contract rent, the tenant may choose to vacate or
relocate.
These datasets are credible as they are used widely in the real estate industry, and they permit
geographic analysis in which data on properties near bicycle facility projects can be compared to a
control group, or data on properties near bicycle facility projects can be compared before and after the
installation. 42

5.3.1 Data Source and Variables
In order to process the data for the appropriate treatment and control corridors, as defined in Section
4.1, the City extracted commercial business rental data using polygons in the online tool available

40

See: https://www.costar.com/

41

Although property values are also available through the city assessor, these can involve longer time lags for availability.

42

The City maintains an existing subscription to CoStar Group for other purposes.

through CoStar. 43 Extracted information includes the list of included businesses, as well as several
quarterly measures, including the number of buildings, the available square footage, availability as a
percent of total square footage of rentable building area, and the overall rental rate (per square foot)
for all service types. Historical data availability varies by corridor.

5.3.2 Data Quality
In considering the quality of the data, both the number of buildings represented in the data in each
corridor and the total number of observations in the time series of availability and overall rent
information were considered. 44 Ideally, a data series for analysis would contain actual individual
business unit level information over time. However, the available data only allows for a snapshot of
business units (i.e., at a single point in time), or a time series of historical data for a group of business
units. If data were available at the business unit level over time, further statistical analysis would be
possible. For the analysis conducted, the time series information was used at the corridor level, but
given the lack of transparency in the processes used to aggregate values extracted in the dataset, in
particular rental rates, interpretation should be made with caution.
The number of businesses represented in the data varies substantially by corridor. Given that the data
quality varies by corridor, analysis was not possible for all identified corridors. In particular, the Western
Ave and Cambridge Street corridors and their respective controls, as defined in Section 4.1, did not have
a large number of buildings represented in the data.
Additionally, some corridors had substantial missing rent data and/or availability data in the period from
2013 Q1 to 2023 Q2 (42 quarters). The Cambridge St. treatment and control corridors, as well as the
Mass Ave. – Trowbridge/Pleasant and Western Ave. corridors all have over 50% of quarters with missing
data for rent and/or availability (Table 7). As a result, these corridors were not considered for analysis.

To analyze the corridors, the time period following the installation of separated bike lanes was
considered to be a treatment period (i.e., the treatment is the installation of separated bicycle facilities),
and the period prior to and during installation was considered to be a pre-treatment period. For the
three corridors examined, the time periods used for treatment and pre-treatment assignment are
shown in Table 9.

The variables of interest used for analysis were the average availability and the average overall rent.
Two comparisons were made for each corridor analyzed. The first comparison is between the pretreatment and treatment period averages 46 within a single corridor, using a t-test for comparison of
means for the treatment corridors. 47 The null hypothesis of the test is that the difference of the means
between the two groups compared is zero. A statistically significant difference indicates a difference in
the means of the two groups for the variable of interest. However, no causal inference should be made
from the results of the t-test. In other words, statistically significant results indicate only that the mean
values differ, not that the treatment (i.e., installation of protected bike lanes) was the cause of that
difference. When considering a difference in means, there are several alternative hypotheses that can
be considered. The first is that the difference in means is not equal to zero, the second is that the pretreatment mean is greater than the treatment period mean (the difference between the values is
positive), and the third is that the treatment period mean is greater (the difference between the values
is negative). Depending on the sign of the difference in the means, it is possible to infer that there is an
increase or decrease in the (space) availability (i.e., where lower availability in the treatment period
relative to the pre-treatment period indicates fewer vacancies available to rent). Conversely for overall
rent, depending on the sign, inference can be drawn on an increase or decrease in rent.
Table 10 shows the pre-treatment and treatment period comparison for Mass Ave. – Alewife/Dudley,
Brattle St., and Mass Ave. – Roseland/Beech for the availability in treatment corridors. For Mass Ave. –
Alewife Dudley, the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the pre-treatment and
treatment values is not rejected. For Brattle St., the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the
means is rejected at the five percent significance level, and there is higher average availability in the
treatment period. Conversely, for Mass Ave. – Roseland Beech, the null hypothesis is rejected at the one
percent significance level, and there is a lower average availability in the treatment period. Given these
45

N reflects total possible quarters of data in period.

As discussed above, the construction of the dataset affects what analysis is possible. While availability (i.e., whether a
building is available for rent) is generally considered a binary variable, the construction of the data set, which includes a time
series of shares of available space as a continuous variable, a t-test for equality of means is used in this analysis for comparison
of availability.

46

T-tests for equality of means are used to compare the mean values of two groups and a specified confidence level is used to
accept or reject the null hypothesis that the means are the same, that is, a statistically significant value indicates confidence
that the means are not equal. Analysis can also consider the power of the test, which can be interpreted as the probability that
the test of significance will correctly estimate a difference in the values when it does exist.

conflicting results, the results of this test are not conclusive when considering the (space) availability
variable. It should also be noted that both Mass Ave. corridors considered have a small number of posttreatment quarters for analysis. Ideally, future analysis would consider additional post-treatment
quarters as the information becomes available.

A pre-treatment and treatment period analysis for Mass Ave – Alewife/Dudley, and Brattle St. on the
overall rent in the treatment corridors was also conducted. For both corridors, the analysis showed that
treatment period rent is higher than pre-treatment period rent (in unadjusted terms). However, in real
terms, the average rents before and after installation are not different. As is noted above, rental rates
have a higher share of missing entries in the dataset, and the methods for calculating these values were
not transparent.
Another comparison that can be made is between each treatment corridor and its respective control
corridor for the pre-treatment and treatment periods, also using a t-test for comparison of means. The
results of this test are shown for an example corridor, Brattle St., in Table 11. 48 There is not a statistically
significant difference in average availability between the treatment and control corridors in the pretreatment period or in the treatment period at the five percent level. However, in the treatment period,
the null is rejected at a ten percent level, indicating higher availability rates in the control corridor
relative to the treatment corridor.

This corridor was selected due to the availability of the largest number of both pre- and post-treatment quarters among
analysis corridors.

5.3.4 Conclusions
In summary, comparisons of space availability or rental data can be made between the pre-treatment
(installation) period and treatment (post-installation) period for bike lane corridors, as well as between
treatment corridors and their respective controls. Utilization of CoStar as a data source revealed several
substantial sources of error for this analysis. As discussed previously, an ideal data source for
commercial rental prices or availability rates would include historical data for individual units or
buildings which includes actual and/or estimated rental value, and availability percentage. However,
data extracts used for analysis were not at the individual business level, and instead historical data was
available at the more aggregate corridor level. Even at the aggregate level, data included many missing
values in either rent, availability, or both, and the definitions of the variables lacked transparency in
terms of the process for aggregation.
Examining corridors with the least missing data resulted in conflicting results for different corridors
when comparing the pre-treatment (pre-installation of separated bicycle facilities) time periods to the
treatment (post-installation) periods. That is, the Brattle St. treatment area showed an increase in
availability (more vacancies) in the post-installation period, while the Mass Ave – Roseland/Beech
treatment area showed a reduction (fewer vacancies) in the post-installation period. These impacts met
thresholds for statistical significance but were relatively small in practical terms. When conducting the
analysis on the basis of comparing treatment and control corridors, the results were not significant in
the treatment period. Overall, only limited inferences can be drawn from the CoStar real estate data,
but they generally indicate that differences in commercial property within corridors and between time
periods, or between treatment and control corridors, are not substantial and may vary by location.
Looking forward, planning for a similar analysis for future projects should consider the availability of
individual business-level information as well as sufficient pre- and post-treatment time period
availability.

Surveys Conducted by the City of
Cambridge
6.1 Review of Literature
McCormick (2012) 49 administered a business survey via interview for a corridor in Los Angeles regarding
perceived impacts of car and bike lanes. The survey included questions on business tenure, whether the
building is owned or rented, and the number of employees. The survey also included questions
regarding perceived impacts on business access of traffic calming, increased/decreased car lanes, and
bicycle lanes. The survey included an oral consent script. McCormick notes that for speed of
implementation, the survey primarily uses yes/no or multiple-choice formats. The survey was
administered in both English and Spanish and was administered in person. The sample was developed
using a comprehensive list of active businesses to develop the population using an online mapping
database of assessor information and field visits. The businesses in the survey sample were selected
using a random number generator. It is noted that response rates were low and additional businesses
were selected.
Sztabinski (2009) 50 administered a merchant survey for a corridor in Toronto regarding perceived
impacts of reduced parking to businesses. The survey methodology involved requesting a manager or
business owner complete the survey, and three follow ups with each business. The survey was only
administered to ground-floor merchants. The survey content regarded customers served, percent of
customers estimated to be driving, and expected change in customers in hypothetical scenarios which
would remove parking. The survey totaled 5 questions, and 61 out of 110 surveyed businesses
responded. The survey response rates varied by type of business, with store owners responding at a
higher rate than restaurants and bars or service businesses. Sztabinski notes study limitations regarding
the lack of random sampling and potential bias to surveying only ground-floor merchants, as well as
seasonality.
As noted in Section 2.4, Chappel et al. (2018) conducted an intercept survey of customers in paired
corridors, where pairs were determined based on business density and mix, as well as population
demographic and mode choice characteristics, to examine mode choice and consumer behavior. The
survey questionnaire included 20 questions regarding the current shopping trip (business type,
projected spending), travel to the area (on the current trip, frequency, and frequency by bike), and

demographic information (access to a car of bicycle, income, and home location). The survey ultimately
had 250 valid responses. Findings of the intercept survey were generally mixed or counterintuitive, and
the authors note that intercept survey findings do not establish causal impacts of bicycle infrastructure.

6.2 Business Survey
In order to supplement other data sources, the City conducted a survey of local businesses regarding
trends in business and sales with respect to bike lane installations and parking. The City met with
relevant stakeholders such as the City Council and business associations while developing the survey,
determined the final survey population, and distributed and administered the survey.

6.2.1 Methodology
The survey methodology first developed a list of eligible Cambridge businesses in order to define the
survey population. Next, a survey questionnaire was developed with input from the Volpe Center.
6.2.1.1

Determining Survey Population

Initial planning for the survey indicated that, generally, first floor businesses would be preferred for the
survey population, but some businesses such as medical offices that are not on the first floor have
expressed concerns regarding the impacts of bike lanes and parking changes. Instead of considering the
business’s physical address, the City determined that the survey population would include businesses of
specific types (e.g., medical, retail, service, recreation, food). 51 The initial list began with businesses that
have permits or licenses with the City, 52 however, this is not universal, and the list was supplemented
with available information from other sources. 53 Final manual review to determine relevant businesses
included the addition of missing medical professionals, new businesses, and missing businesses

More specifically, in reviewing data, relevant NAICS codes were determined to be 44, 45, 53, 62, 71, 72, 81. Businesses with a
NAICS code of 0, blank, or NA were not removed from the list developed by the City.

51

Within the existing business list from the city, NAICS code was generated based on available SIC Code fields, duplicates were
identified and manually reviewed based on the account name and address, and manual review was conducted to identify street
addresses if the field was empty in the underlying data. Addresses were also reviewed to confirm that the location and zip code
were consistent with addresses in the City of Cambridge.

52

Supplemental information from INFOUSA was used to determine addresses and to add additional samples in NAICS code 62.
For exact business name matches between the City’s data and the INFOUSA data where supplemental information was
required, the address from INFOUSA was used and manual review using internet search was also conducted. If no match could
be made with the INFOUSA database, an address was assigned via manual review using internet search where possible.
Businesses which could not be identified via internet search, businesses with addresses outside the City of Cambridge, closed
businesses, and corporate office buildings were removed where possible. For manual review of apparent duplicate records,
where possible, the company name was used over the name of a person in assigning the business name, and the City’s existing
business data was used over the INFOUSA data, as it was considered to be more reliable.

identified by the City. The initial list of survey recipients included 1,675 businesses within the City of
Cambridge. The City also allowed businesses (if not contacted) to contact the City in order to be included
in the survey effort.
6.2.1.2

Survey Questionnaire

Survey topics included business characteristics such as tenure, address, type of business, and number of
customers. The survey also included changes to business revenue since 2019 (pre-COVID baseline),
whether a bike lane was installed/changed near the business in the last several years (including prior to
2020), perceived business impacts of bike lanes/street changes, and whether parking or loading zones
were impacted near the business, and any perceived business impacts of parking or loading zone
changes. A complete list of survey questions is included in Appendix A.
Based on feedback received prior to survey design, and the lack of availability of tax data from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, consideration was given to allowing businesses to voluntarily share
data that they may consider relevant to this study. This survey question was noted as optional, and
respondents had the opportunity to note whether the City should follow up with the respondent so that
the respondent could securely share information with the City. The question was noted as optional to
minimize potential impacts on survey response rates. Prior to survey administration, it was expected
that the number of businesses that would opt in to this option would be small, but given anecdotal
feedback received by the City prior to survey administration, the question was included. In total, one
business chose to share sales data with the City. Analysis of this information is not included in this
report.

6.2.2 Survey Administration
The survey was administered beginning on July 5, 2023, and the final responses analyzed in this report
were as of September 5, 2023. 54 The survey was conducted via an online survey tool, with unique URLs
for individual businesses. The initial survey notification was sent via mail to increase confidence in
authenticity, with an explanation of the study and the Cycling Safety Ordinance. 55 In order to increase
the response rate, the City conducted follow-ups using email, phone, and/or in person notification using
fliers provided to businesses. Instructions were provided that the survey should be completed by the
owner or manager of the business, when possible, to ensure the accuracy of information.

The survey remained open through October 31, 2023, ultimately receiving 320 responses. Responses received after
September 5, 2023 were evaluated qualitatively, however the responses reported in this report only include responses received
as of September 5, 2023.

6.2.3 Survey Response Rate and Coverage
In total, the City received 277 survey responses. Out of the survey population of 1,697 potential
businesses, 231 businesses were removed from the list for a variety of reasons as shown in Table 12. 56
As a result, the total population of recipients is considered to be 1,590 businesses, and the associated
response rate based on this number is approximately 17%.

Table 13 shows the distribution of outgoing sample and survey response across business zip code. The
02139 zip code had the most businesses (36%), and this share is similar to the outgoing distribution in
that zip code (33%). However, it should be noted that the 02140 zip code is over-represented in the
surveyed businesses compared to the overall outgoing sample, with 28% of responses in that zip code
compared to 19% of the outgoing population, and conversely the 02138 zip code is underrepresented in
the survey businesses, with 24% of responses in that zip code, compared to 34% of the outgoing
population. While the City made efforts to follow up with non-respondents, the survey was voluntary,
and the businesses and any associated responses may not be representative of the full population of
businesses in the City.

Some businesses were removed in the calculation of response rate. These included closed businesses, businesses that have
moved or do not exist, duplicates, and businesses outside the City of Cambridge. Businesses that are located in or are part of a
hospital or university or other ineligible space (e.g., large office building) were also removed. Businesses which had returned
letters are considered to have unknown eligibility, and businesses which refused the survey through contact with the City are
considered eligible non-respondents.

6.2.4 Survey Responses
The survey questionnaire addressed both questions regarding general business characteristics, the
impact of bicycle facilities, and parking. Each topic is discussed in detail in the following sections. All
responses are reported for the full set of 277 businesses unless otherwise specified. Survey responses
were geolocated to correspond with the six treatment corridors outlined in Section 4.1 and 4.2, (see
Figure 1 ). Given small sample sizes, analysis at the individual corridor level was not possible, both in
considering any statistical analysis and for the purposes of not reporting data which could identify the
response of any particular business to the survey.
For the purposes of analyzing the business survey responses, businesses were categorized as being in a
treatment corridor if they are located within the defined 100-yard corridor radius of any of the six
treatment corridors, in a control corridor if they are located within the defined 100-yard corridor radius
of any of the six control corridors, and non-corridor if they are located outside of all defined corridor
radii of the 12 treatment and control corridors (see Section 4.2 for geographic corridor definitions). As
noted in Section 4.1, the corridors explored in this study are reflective of only a portion of total bicycle
facilities in the City, and therefore, non-corridor businesses may or may not have separated bicycle
facilities or bicycle facilities of any type depending on their location.

General Business Characteristics – Overall

The majority of businesses responding to the survey opened prior to 2020, with only 12.6% reporting
that they have been at their location since 2020 or later (Figure 13).
Figure 13. Business Tenure at Location (Question 4, n = 277)

The largest group of responding businesses were identified as dining or takeout, at 30%, and the second
largest group is retail sales at 25%, followed by professional services (example: medical office), at 20%,
and then personal services (examples: hair salon, childcare) at 16%, as shown in Table 14. 58

businesses reporting intermediate scale values. However, it should be noted that the large number of
missing responses (17% weekday, 18% weekend) to these questions indicates that it may be difficult for
businesses to answer this question without prior preparation.
Figure 14. Reported Average Daily Customers Served, Weekday and Weekend (Questions 5 and 6, n = 277)

About half of survey businesses reported current overall revenue has decreased significantly (25%) or
decreased somewhat (23%) since 2019 at the surveyed location. The next largest share of businesses is
those reporting that revenue is about the same (20%) compared to a 2019 baseline, and fewer
businesses report that revenue has increased somewhat or significantly since 2019, with 13% of
businesses reporting that revenue has increased somewhat, and 6% of businesses reporting that
revenue has increased significantly (Figure 15).

The types of businesses reporting an increase versus a decrease in revenue since 2019 varied. Figure 16
shows the share of responses indicating revenue increased, decreased, or is about the same among the
business reporting a revenue change (i.e., removing don’t know, N/A, and missing responses) by
business type. Dining/Takeout businesses had the largest share reporting a decrease in revenue, at 64%,
while retail sales had the largest share reporting an increase in revenue, at 35%.

Among businesses reporting that revenue decreased significantly or decreased somewhat, the majority
of businesses reported decreases in revenue less than or equal to 44%. The largest group of businesses
reported a 30% to 44% decrease, followed by businesses reporting a 15% to 29% decrease. Figure 17

Figure 19 shows business type by corridor assignment. Businesses that are in a treatment corridor are in
any of the treatment corridors identified for this study, and the control corridor businesses are in
identified control corridors (see Section 4 for corridor definitions).
Figure 19. Business Type by Corridor Assignment – Treatment versus Control (Question 3, n=166)

Figure 20 shows the reported change in revenue since 2019 by corridor assignment. Treatment-corridor
businesses reported that revenue decreased significantly (38%) more than businesses in control
corridors (20%), and reported that revenue was about the same or increased somewhat less than
businesses in control corridors. Comparing the share of businesses in the treatment versus control group
reporting any decrease in revenue, a larger share of businesses in the treatment corridor report any

Bicycle Facilities – Overall

Just under two thirds (63%) of businesses reported that bicycle facilities, such as protected bike lanes,
have been installed or expanded in the immediate area of their business in the past few years, while
27% report that no bicycle facilities have been installed or expanded (Figure 21). It should be noted that
while treatment and control corridors were assigned based on recent construction of separated bicycle
facilities, the survey questions referred to any bicycle facility type.
Figure 21. Reported Bicycle Facilities Installed or Changed (Question 10, n = 277)

Among businesses reporting bicycle facilities were installed, about half of businesses report changes
resulted in a decrease in the overall level of revenue for their businesses at that the surveyed location,

with 27% reporting a significant decrease, and 22% reporting that revenue decreased somewhat. Very
few businesses (3%) reported that revenue increased somewhat as a result of bicycle facility installation
or expansion, and no businesses reported a significant increase in revenue. Among businesses reporting
that bicycle facilities were installed or expanded, 26% reporting that revenue is about the same, 10%
reported that they did not know the impact on revenue, and an additional 10% responded “not
applicable”. 63

Bicycle Facilities – Corridor Assignment

Figure 23 shows the reported change in bicycle facilities by corridor assignment for treatment and
control corridors. The vast majority of treatment corridor businesses (87%) reported that bicycle
facilities were added or changed in the last few years, compared to about half (53%) of businesses
located in control corridors. While the control corridors do not currently have separated bike lanes, the
question wording referred to any installation or changes to bicycle facilities, and the radius used by
businesses from their business when responding to the questionnaire may vary, as well the physical
location of a business within a corridor varies. Given that some corridors assigned for this study were
constructed prior to 2019, the 8% of businesses in treatment corridors that reported facilities did not
change in the last few years may be a reasonable response. Comparing the share of businesses in the
treatment versus control group reporting any change in bicycle facilities, a larger proportion of

6.3 Customer Intercept Surveys
Customer intercept surveys can be useful in determining trends in a variety of factors including trip
purpose, trip mode, customer demographics, and customer spending. To supplement other data
sources, the City conducted a customer intercept survey in the summer of 2023. The City has also

conducted customer intercept surveys in previous years in various locations throughout the City. While
these data do not provide direct evidence regarding changes in business sales, they allow other
information to be viewed in context by providing trip mode and trip purpose information.

6.3.1 Historical Data – Trip Mode
The City has conducted intercept surveys in previous years, 71 most recently Harvard Square in 2022,
Porter Square/Lower Mass Ave in 2019, Inman Square in 2018, and Central Square in 2017. In past years,
intercept survey efforts were targeted to a single location in the City. Figure 32 shows the share of
respondents reporting each trip mode. Respondents could report more than one mode, so values do not
sum to 100%. 72 Among historical respondents, walking and transit generally are the most popular
modes. Due to the voluntary nature of the survey, the respondents and any associated responses may
not be representative of the full population of residents or visitors to the surveyed locations.
Figure 32. Share of Respondents Reporting Each Mode (for First Two Modes Reported) by Historical
Survey

6.3.2 Summer 2023 Intercept Survey Methodology
The survey was conducted as a customer intercept survey in several locations throughout the City of
Cambridge in July and August of 2023. Survey topics included respondent characteristics such as age,
trip purpose, trip frequency, trip mode(s), and spending amount. Survey questions were intended to be
as comparable as possible with previous customer intercept surveys conducted by the City in wording,
although analysis comparing the previous surveys and the current surveys should be conducted with

found in Appendix A.

6.3.3 Summer 2023 Intercept Survey Administration
The survey was administered from July 13, 2023 to August 11, 2023. The survey was conducted via inperson intercept, in several locations. The locations were: Alewife/Fresh Pond, Central Square (which
includes Mass Ave. to Harvard Square), East Cambridge/Cambridge Street, Harvard Square, Huron
Village, Inman Square, Kendall Square and Porter Square (which includes both North and South Mass
Ave.).

6.3.4 Summer 2023 Intercept Survey Response
In total, the City received 214 survey responses. The distribution of responses by location is shown in

Trip Mode

The share of respondents reporting each mode was calculated, and results are shown in Figure 37. 74 The
most common mode was any walking, reported by about half of respondents, followed by any transit at
23%, and any driving at 17%.

When mode choice is considered by location, results vary (Figure 38). While any walking is reported by
the largest share of respondents in most surveyed locations, any transit is reported by the largest share
of respondents in East Cambridge/Cambridge Street and Huron Village. The areas with the largest shares
reporting any bicycle travel are East Cambridge/Cambridge Street and Harvard Square, both at 17% of
respondents surveyed in that area.

Conclusions
This study has applied a mixed-methods approach to assessing the impacts of protected bicycle lane
infrastructure projects in Cambridge on retail sales and overall neighborhood economic vitality. In the
sections above, the study team reviewed existing published literature and prior studies on this topic;
presented an overview of the specific project corridors studied and study methodology; and analyzed
the available data across multiples sources and datasets, using both “before vs. after” and “treatment
vs. control” approaches. Data sources include Census data on employment and income, commercial
databases covering real estate and retail sales, and survey responses from local business owners and
customers. In this section, the findings are distilled into a set of overall conclusions and suggestions for
future studies.

7.1 Context
While several studies have previously examined the impacts of bicycle infrastructure projects on retail
sales, there is still a relatively limited degree of coverage in the literature. Within the available studies,
there is arguably no clear consensus on these impacts, as they can vary significantly according to the
details of each project and neighborhood-specific factors such as demographics and retail mix. That said,
as summarized in Section 2, there is a general finding across studies that impacts – whether positive or
negative – are fairly modest in magnitude and can be difficult to discern against the backdrop of larger
macroeconomic changes such as unemployment, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and interest rates.
Individual project outcomes can also be affected by weather, seasonality, changes in transit service and
fares, new property developments in the area, and other factors that are largely unrelated to the bicycle
infrastructure. This can be mitigated to some extent by using a treatment vs. control methodology,
which allows project areas to be compared against otherwise similar areas that would have experienced
similar external factors.
The data available at each location can also vary significantly, since some cities have local sales taxes or
agreements with data providers that can permit more in-depth analysis, while others have relied on
publicly available Census data and similar datasets. The choice of data and the metrics used to define
and measure impacts (e.g., tax receipts vs. property values) can also influence the conclusions from prior
studies as to whether there were changes in the retail environment as a result of bicycle infrastructure
projects.
Analysis of smaller, “quick build” bicycle projects, as is the case here, presents additional inherent
challenges because of the very high level of granularity that is needed in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. That is, with projects that may extend for only a few blocks in each direction, regional and
citywide data of the type used for other studies are often of limited use because they do not clearly
distinguish between treatment and non-treatment areas. It is necessary instead to develop datasets that

Packet Pg. 109

can provide information at the level of individual city blocks or even specific locations. Likewise, data
that are presented at the annual level do not have the specificity to distinguish impacts that took place
during the portions of the year that were before, rather than after, the completion of the bicycle lane
project. (Impacts that occur after the project is implemented cannot necessarily be assumed to be
caused by the project, as other factors could be more influential, but it is reasonable to infer that
impacts that occur prior to implementation were unlikely to have been caused by the project.)
Ultimately, no single source of data can provide perfect insight into changes in retail sales, particularly
when direct records such as register receipts and tax records are not available.

7.2 Findings from the Analysis
Despite these limitations, the study team was able to identify some important patterns in the data:
•

LEHD data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that there was a slight downward trend in food
and retail income and employment in Cambridge relative to the rest of the Boston metro area,
and that this predates both the Cycling Safety Ordinance and the COVID-19 pandemic.
o Understanding the causes of this trend is beyond the scope of the current study, though
it may be related to an underlying shift in the city’s commercial base, with an increase in
professional services and related industries.
o Due to this preexisting trend, it is possible that the counterfactual baseline in which no
bicycle facilities were constructed would still feature a decline in overall retail sales in
Cambridge, despite no changes to parking or other factors affecting access.
o Direct comparisons of bike lane installation areas (also referred to in the report as
treatment areas) against control areas and citywide averages show little to no
consistent differences in retail employment levels in the period up to 2020.

•

Commercial real estate data provides an indirect measure of retail sales and overall
neighborhood vitality, but exhibits changes over time which could be due to many factors
unrelated to bicycle infrastructure. The study team’s analysis of commercial real estate
availability data and rent estimates from the CoStar database found very few significant
differences between treatment areas and control areas.
o Availability increased after bicycle lane implementation in one treatment area, which is
an indicator of a weaker rental market and retail environment, while in another
treatment area, the opposite was true, i.e., there was a decrease in availability which
would indicate a stronger market. Both effects were relatively small.

•

SafeGraph data on estimated retail spending were analyzed to assess differences between
treatment and control areas. This dataset provides monthly updates and a high level of
geographic specificity, making it a logical choice for this type of analysis; however, it is important

to note that the data does not directly capture transaction records, but instead represents
estimates using location-based services and a proprietary algorithm. The study team’s review of
the raw data showed that there were many unexplained inconsistencies, such as implausibly low
estimated transaction volumes or sales estimates that varied by 100-fold over the course of a
few months, in addition to large sales data gaps for many establishments. This made it
unsuitable for any sort of difference-in-difference regression or other analysis, and no
conclusions could be drawn from this dataset.
•

Responses to a survey administered by the City of Cambridge yielded a wide range of views from
business respondents in Cambridge, covering trends in business revenue, customer counts,
parking availability, and the impacts of nearby bicycle infrastructure projects. When comparing
businesses in treatment corridors against those in control corridors, the study team found that
respondents in treatment areas were more likely to report a decrease in revenue, and that this
difference was statistically significant.
o The limited number of respondents in each treatment area limited the ability to
examine any key differences by type of business (e.g., retail, dining, professional
services, etc.) or by location within the city.
o The time period covered by the survey had an unusually influential set of external
factors (pandemic disruptions, followed by historically high inflation and interest rates)
making it more difficult to infer that changes in revenue were caused by, rather than
merely associated with, the changes to bicycle facilities and parking. Moreover,
although a number of techniques including personal follow-up were applied to increase
survey response rates, the voluntary nature of the survey means that it may not be fully
representative of all affected businesses as a whole.

7.3 Overall Takeaways
Taken as a whole, the data sources described above present a mixed picture of the effects of bicycle
infrastructure projects on retail/services sales. Looking strictly at quantitative data, there are little to no
discernable differences between “treatment” areas and otherwise similar “control” areas, and most
of the differences that exist are either not statistically significant or point in opposite directions. To
some extent this reflects the underlying limitations of the data sources, which were generally not
designed for analysis at this highly detailed geographic scale. Meanwhile, survey data indicated that
businesses in treatment areas were more likely than those in control areas to report a decrease in
revenue.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to compare these perceived changes in sales against quantitative
sales data, as the relevant SafeGraph dataset suffered from data quality issues that made it unsuitable
for analysis.

7.4 Considerations for Future Analysis
Due to the ambitious schedule associated with the Cycling Safety Ordinance, it is understandable that
most of the effort to date has been associated with deployment and implementation rather than with
assessment of impacts. In addition, the timing of the CSO meant that many of these projects took place
during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it difficult to collect meaningful baseline data on traffic volumes
and other variables. Going forward, the City may wish to take a more forward-looking approach in which
more robust evaluation is built into each deployment from the outset. As this study has shown, it is
possible to conduct a purely retrospective assessment of the changes in retail sales and neighborhood
economic vitality, but most of the available data sources do not provide detail at the temporal (i.e.,
monthly) and geographical scales required.
Based on this experience, the study team identified a number of suggestions for future analysis. The
overall goal would be to create a systematic evaluation approach for future infrastructure projects that
defines a baseline and employs multiple streams of data to draw inferences about project impacts.
•

•

First, it is important to define treatment and control areas with geographic precision in advance
of infrastructure projects so that data can be systematically gathered to support analysis of
transportation and local business impacts. Because the business impacts of infrastructure
projects are typically small relative to changes in the business cycle and other contextual factors,
it is necessary to define these areas precisely and gather data to serve as a pre-treatment
baseline. Without a careful definition of treatment and control areas, any analysis would need
to rely on a before-vs.-after comparison, in which it is much more difficult to detect meaningful
differences, make causal inferences, or control for the influence of external factors.
Improved parking data could add an important dimension to the analysis. Several stakeholders
and survey respondents noted that changes to on-street parking – rather than the bicycle
facilities themselves – are the primary mechanism by which retail sales may be affected. The
City has developed a database of on-street parking spaces and is able to track changes in parking
inventory associated with bicycle projects. In-depth studies have also been conducted in the
area of some corridors. However, there is currently no means by which parking occupancy and
duration can be monitored in real time or at a detailed geographic level. 75 This makes it difficult
to analyze parking impacts over time or to compare treatment areas, which may be as small as a
few blocks, to control areas.
o Ideally, such studies would obtain a pre-treatment baseline on parking inventory,
utilization/occupancy levels by day and time, meter revenue, and violation rates.
However, some of the more granular data on parking utilization would require
investments in new data collection procedures. With this information, changes to the
baseline on these metrics could then be tracked, allowing for more definitive

assessment of whether parking changes may have affected the accessibility of the area
and the retail environment.
o Systematic tracking of parking impacts, including occupancy, turnover, and violations
would also help establish a clear empirical basis for discussions with neighborhood
stakeholders. For example, survey data indicated that businesses sometimes had
differing responses about whether there had been changes to parking, even within the
same treatment area, suggesting that there is some subjectivity in these assessments.
o Detailed analysis of parking utilization could help identify policy changes that could
mitigate any negative impacts of parking loss, for example by better matching of time
limits to usage patterns, or programs to increase turnover and availability.
Vehicle, pedestrian, and bicyclist counts from the treatment and control areas are another
potential data source to provide a fuller picture of project impacts. While these do not provide
direct measures of retail/personal services sales and can be influenced by external factors such
as seasonality, they provide proxy measures of the change in accessibility of treatment areas
and can help the evaluation team to interpret other trends in the data. A number of public and
private data providers also offer estimates of traffic volumes and congestion, which can be used
as another metric of project outcomes.
City staff can continue to monitor offerings by private sector data providers to assess whether
new or revised offerings can be used for analysis of bicycle infrastructure corridors.
o In the case of CoStar data on commercial real estate, the study team suggests working
with the data provider to develop a method to produce more robust time-series data on
rents and vacancies, with fewer missing data points and clearer definitions of rental
values and other variables.
o For SafeGraph and similar data providers that could provide more direct measures of
retail sales, periodic checks of sample data could be conducted to assess whether data
quality has improved to the point where these datasets could support analysis.
However, presently the dataset is not suitable for statistical analysis at the geographic
level required for this type of study.
o Future studies may also consider the NETS database, which was noted as a potential
source of retail sales and employment data in previous studies. The study team lacked
time and resources to do a comprehensive review of the data, and significant questions
remain on the data viability in terms of data coverage, retail sale imputation by
establishment and time dimension (annualized data).
Coordination with public sector agencies can also potentially yield new data options that could
be used to analyze project impacts. These include the release of updated LEHD data from the
U.S. Census Bureau as well as access to the more geographically detailed LEHD dataset.
o Data from tax records have also been used in other studies and are typically of high
quality due to consistent reporting requirements and definitions. While the City was
unable to reach agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue on a datasharing arrangement due to taxpayer privacy concerns, it is possible that a future

agreement could be reached that uses fully anonymized data and/or a secure data
commons that limits output to aggregate statistics. 76
Business surveys proved to be a useful means for obtaining direct feedback on bicycle project
impacts, but like all surveys, there are issues with self-selection and other potential sources of
bias, as well as differences in interpretation of some questions. In particular, future surveys may
wish to provide more detailed definitions (and possibly pictures) of different types of bicycle
infrastructure, as the terminology may not be consistently understood.
o More frequent survey administration would also allow for more reliable and consistent
baseline data, and would permit analysis of changes over a shorter time period with
fewer confounding factors.
o Continued periodic business surveys of non-treatment areas are also important to serve
as controls. These survey responses may also be useful to other departments within the
City as indicators of overall retail health.

information can be analyzed for research purposes without disclosing personal identifying information.

To evaluate the economic impacts of bike lane installation/parking changes, we need as much objective data on
sales before and after the changes were implemented. If you would like to provide your business’ ﬁnancial data for
this study, you can do so in two ways listed below. This is OPTIONAL. If you choose to share your data, your
information will be treated conﬁdentially. Your business will NOT be identiﬁed by name or address in
any studies.
To share more information about the ﬁnancials of your business pre and post separated bike lane installation, you
may upload any of your 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 business tax returns, proﬁt and loss statements, or similar
