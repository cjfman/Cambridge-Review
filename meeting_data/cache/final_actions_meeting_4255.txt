KEY STUDY FINDINGS
FTTP in Cambridge will likely require a City contribution to be financially feasible
• The full capital cost is estimated at ~$194 million, incorporating a 30% contingency and
inflation over a 5-year construction period, assuming a 40% take-rate.
• A City contribution of ~$150 million is required to establish a sustainable FTTP business
from scratch, applying reasonable assumptions under a “base case”. This contribution is
the investment the City would need to make for which there would likely be no return. The
remaining capex can be supported from net revenues after operating costs.
• Entering into a partnership with one or more entities to lease fiber and run the business
would reduce the City’s risks and potentially reduce costs. A partner could potentially
leverage existing operations and assets, achieving economies of scale.

FINANCIAL MODEL
A custom financial model was developed to understand the project’s business case
and key sensitivities with the following key inputs:
• Capital expenses: Outside plant, network equipment, drops, CPE, buildout schedule, etc.
• Pricing: Target pricing based on market, mix of full paying vs. low-income
• Take-rate / adoption curve: Steady state take-rate, take-rate ramp up, churn
• Operating expenditures:
– Labor costs
– Non-labor parametric operating costs (e.g., $x per pole times n poles)
– Other non-labor operating costs (e.g., $x per month for insurance)
• Inflation adjustment (capex, opex, revenue)
• Capital grant funding: City subsidy to reduce initial capital expenses
• Financing conditions: Interest rate, expected return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, term, etc.

FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
The baseline feasibility analysis examines the overall attractiveness of the project
from a commercial perspective
• The financial feasibility analysis does not include assumptions around how the citywide FTTP
network is funded or financed, but assesses whether the project requires external funding for
it to be financially feasible based on the fundamentals of the operational cash flows (revenue,
capex, and opex)
• The financial model calculates the internal rate of return of the project (project IRR) using the
operational cash flows over the construction period and 25 years of operations

• To evaluate financial feasibility, the analysis determines what combination of take-rates and
public funding, if any, would be necessary to achieve a sufficient project IRR (assumed to be
10%), given certain assumptions about average revenue per user (ARPU)
• The report includes sensitivity analysis on the baseline feasibility assessment for the following
key variables: Capex, opex, ARPU, and project term

FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS OUTPUTS
Our baseline financial feasibility analysis shows that a ~$150 million upfront
contribution combined with a 40% take rate would achieve a project IRR of ~10%.
The sensitivity analysis shows how changes in pricing and capex amounts affect the
required upfront capital contribution.

investment to reduce upfront
costs

…what City could give up…
• Upside revenue potential
• Control over day-to-day
business operations and
market rate setting

…what City could retain
• Fiber service to all City
premises
• City long-term ownership of
fiber infrastructure
• Affordable options and
pricing control for low-income
households
• Key policy goals around data
privacy and net neutrality

INTEREST IN A PARTNERSHIP IS LIKELY STRONG
A range of companies may be interested in partnering with the City
• Given the attractive Cambridge market, a number of ISPs and infrastructure companies
would likely look at a City RFP seriously
• P3 investors are very comfortable with City owning the asset and the P3 investor having a
long-term commercialization opportunity
• Some ISPs also might be willing to lease City fiber, but others would want fiber ownership
• Some ISPs require a larger footprint (now or in near future) than Cambridge, but they would
explore this themselves

BUSINESS MODEL TAKEAWAYS
Models 2 and 4 are likely to attract strong market interest, with Model 4 transferring
most responsibilities, risk, and control to a private party

Attachment: March 13 City Council Roundtable Deck Rev. 5 (002) (COF 2023 #44 :

1.a

• The City lacks the operational experience and expertise to successfully implement a citywide network as
required under Business Model 1, making this model less feasible and attractive to the City
• Business Model 2 is a viable and attractive business model for the City which leverages the City’s
access to relatively cheap capital to develop the Passive Infrastructure while transferring most of the
operational and commercial risks to a private partner

• Business Model 3 is the least proven model, which builds on Business Model 2 to potentially enable
more competition but creates additional contractual layers which adds significant complexity and is less
familiar to the market
• Business Model 4 increases private sector involvement across all project scope elements to also
include developing and financing Passive Infrastructure

• Regardless of the business model selected, the project will likely require an upfront capital contribution
from the City. But partners may also bring economies of scale and existing assets to the table,
potentially reducing the magnitude of the contribution

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Mailed survey was met with a strong response and has high degree of statistical
validity
• 5,000 survey packets mailed to a random set of Cambridge residential addresses
• Of these, 3,000 went to low-income households (to plan for typically lower response)
• Goal was 450 responses; results exceeded goal, with 604 responses

• Results developed data on relevant topics including
o Current providers used and prices paid
o Willingness to switch to a new FTTP provider at various price points
o Level of support for City taking on a role or subsidizing

MARKET OVERVIEW
Municipal FTTP would primarily compete on a strong local brand with similar pricing to
existing cable offerings, while achieving key public policy goals
• Pricing: The service would offer symmetrical gigabit service with indicative price points of
$70 gigabit ($30 for low-income households, aligned with Affordable Connectivity Program) –
but would likely face promotional pricing pressure from existing providers
• Product: While a fiber product would initially provide a stronger product, Comcast is focused
on infrastructure improvements that could achieve gig symmetry
• Brand: A key competitive advantage would be brand with marketing focused on local pride
and values (data privacy, net neutrality, digital equity, strong local customer service) to drive
adoption and win loyalty

• Public Policy Goals: A municipal offering could ensure policy goals that aren’t being met in
the market, including increased competition, digital equity, data privacy, and net neutrality

MARKET OVERVIEW
Based on national benchmarks, a target take-rate of 30-40% seems feasible in
Cambridge with strong operational and marketing execution
• Successful publicly traded telcos with FTTP operations focus
on achieving 35-40% market penetration

• Higher market penetration above 40% is possible in markets
with weak or no cable competitor; successful case examples
with municipal FTTP networks are mostly run by municipal
electric companies with an existing customer base
• Municipal FTTP networks that are ending up lower than 30%
exhibit poor execution, competition from both cable and
telco FTTP (i.e., Verizon FiOS), and are mostly suburban
markets

Extensive field survey work was conducted to develop preliminary design and inform
capital expenditure estimate

• Field survey conducted by a team of senior
telecommunications outside plant (OSP)
engineers

Attachment: March 13 City Council Roundtable Deck Rev. 5 (002) (COF 2023 #44 :

1.a

– Physical walk-out or drive survey of 100% of
156 miles of candidate public right of way:
62.1% aerial (utility poles available) + 37.9%
underground
– Data collected in real-time using custom
GPS/GIS tools to accurately record findings
• Generated GIS data to inform cost estimates
and market conditions

Notes: See Appendix for more detail

– Presence of existing utility poles
– Make-ready assessment of utility poles
– Presence of existing broadband
infrastructure (cable, fiber, legacy telecom)
Packet43
Pg. 47

INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT
Based on field survey, the proposed network design would create a robust
infrastructure that could serve the city with leading edge technology for decades
• Citywide FTTP comprised of 130.3 route
miles:
– 80.9 miles (62.1%) aerial (utility poles
available)
– 49.4 miles (37.9%) underground

• Key elements would include redundant core
hub sites, fully diverse backbone ring, and
primary/secondary distribution

Attachment: March 13 City Council Roundtable Deck Rev. 5 (002) (COF 2023 #44 :

1.a

• 42 primary Fiber Distribution Cabinets (FDCs)
– Connected to core hubs over fully diverse
primary distribution routes
– Each serves up to 1,500 subscribers
– Supports passive and/or active electronics
Packet44

MUNICIPAL LIGHT PLANT (MLP) STRUCTURE
MLPs are used by some Massachusetts municipalities that directly run broadband
businesses in particular contexts
• An MLP is a Massachusetts legal entity that enables a municipality to directly run an
electricity, gas or (more recently) communications business
– Some longstanding MLPs that provide electricity (e.g., Braintree, Norwood) entered the
cable broadband business about 20 years ago leveraging utility expertise and assets
– Certain rural western Massachusetts towns created MLP structures solely to provide
broadband service using one-shot state capital grants, but the context differs
• Creating a Cambridge MLP would be required if the City wishes to directly run a broadband
business, but by itself does not affect business feasibility
• The City does not need an MLP to build a network that would be operated by a partner who
would in turn provide broadband service
Note: Statements are general in nature and subject to updated legal guidance by qualified counsel. Neither CTC nor Rebel provide legal advice.

COST ESTIMATION OBJECTIVES
Purpose-built analysis to support strategic broadband planning
Understand the range of costs to deploy a state-of-the-art FTTP network under various scenarios for
scope and construction methodologies
• Physical fiber plant construction and design – aerial vs underground, MDU connectivity and interior wiring
• Network hub facilities – redundancy and scale, use of existing facilities
• Network electronics at varying take-rates
• Customer activation costs (service drops and CPE) at varying take-rates

Inform financial modeling and negotiations with candidate private partners
• Generate breakdowns of component parts corresponding to division of capex contributions for most likely partnership
scenarios and targeted populations
– Active vs passive infrastructure
– Wiring of MDUs containing affordable housing
• Collect field data and analysis that can be shared with candidate partners to support their own cost modeling
– Determine availability of existing utility poles and ascertain pole make-ready cost factors
– Characterize make-up of MDU structure types and related deployment cost
