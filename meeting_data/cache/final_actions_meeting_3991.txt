We know we must look at policing differently as well as provide services that go
over and above what we do today.
The City and the Police Department are in support of creating a separate new
Department of Community Safety and Alternative Public Safety Response Program
rooted in harm reduction and trauma informed principles to continue to support
our most vulnerable populations.
With the establishment of this department, the civilian response will be able to
expand and reimagine services outside of the criminal justice system.

The City of Cambridge will be establishing a new Cambridge Department of Community
Safety (CDCS) staffed with trained civilians to provide key community services and
programs targeted at our most vulnerable populations.
CDCS will initially be focused on behavioral health crisis response services and violence
prevention & intervention services; however, CDCS will support other key community
services as well.
➢ Provide behavioral health crisis response services through the Cambridge Alternative Public Safety
Response Program.
➢ Provide a program that will be integrated into the public safety system through ECC to ensure
continuum of patient care.
➢ Promote community violence prevention & intervention services.
➢ Collaborate with outside community organizations to support other key community services.Packet Pg. 13

Cambridge Alternative Response

12

The Cambridge Alternative Public Safety Response Program is an evidence-informed
program that aims to provide a skilled and compassionate response to non-violent calls
involving behavioral health, substance use, and homelessness.
The Cambridge Alternative Public Safety Response Program is rooted in harm-reduction
and trauma-informed care principles and is grounded in the belief that all people deserve
respect, autonomy, dignity, and opportunity.
The target populations for the program are:
➢ Unhoused individuals of all ages
➢ Individuals experiencing mental health crisis, addiction, and/or substance use
➢ Individuals at risk

The program will involve specialized civilian field teams who will serve as the
primary responders to calls received through Emergency Communications
Center (ECC). The medical protocol utilized by ECC staff provides assurances
that patient care will not be compromised. The field teams will employ their
training and lived experiences to provide immediate support to individuals in
crisis.
Initial program staffing model includes six positions:
Director of Community Safety
Program Coordinator
Crisis Response Specialists (2)
Peer Support Specialists (2)

An individual experiencing or
witnessing a crisis calls 9-1-1

A City of Cambridge Emergency
Telecommunications Dispatcher (ETD)
identifies Cambridge Alternative
Response as the appropriate resource
and dispatches an Alternative
Response Team to the scene, instead
of Fire, Police, or traditional EMS

3. RESPONSE
The Alternative Response Team uses their
combined knowledge and lived experience to
assess the situation and work with the individual
in crisis to decide what happens next. If
additional emergency services are needed for
support or safety, field teams are integrated in to
ECC to get additional help. Also, if additional
aftercare is needed, the team will work with
community partners such as HEART to respond.

4. SUPPORT
The Alternative Response Team uses their
knowledge of community resources to connect the
individual in crisis with additional supportive
services for follow-up. We envision HEART playing a
key role in the delivery of mutual aid services, aftercare, conflict resolution, coordination of resources
and case management etc.

The City hopes to have HEART involved where/when appropriate, in the above program model for response and support.

The City has had additional discussions with several community resources regarding the
provision of key services. These resources include:
➢
➢

➢

The Black Response (TBR)/HEART Proposal
The Thought Partner Project
ROCA
HUB, Yablo Consulting

Partnerships with community-based organizations like these are essential in pursuit of
creating a network of meaningful support for our community and an Alternative
response model that will serve our community.

Although the Cambridge Alternative Public Safety
Response Program seeks to provide immediate crisis
response, that is only one component of a comprehensive
Alternative response/support system.

Collaboration with outside partners is an essential piece of
the puzzle and is integral to the City’s mission of creating a
safe and healthy city for all Cambridge residents. We hope
that The Black Response (TBR)/HEART will be a key partner
in providing these services.

Next Steps: Collaboration

As we take steps to move ahead, it is important for the City to work within an
established network to provide these crisis services and additional violence prevention
efforts. The Department of Community Safety and Alternative Public Safety Response
Program will provide services through a model that is unmatched.
We are committed to providing additional support as the program evolves and will work
with other organizations including TBR/HEART to provide additional complimentary
services in the future while enhancing accountability and trust within the community.
The City will have continued discussions and hopes to have a strong partnership with
TBR/HEART to provide key services outlined in this presentation and in our
communication sent July 27, 2021.

Next Steps: Collaboration

The City has made a commitment to fund a new Department of Community Safety that will oversee the
Alternative Public Safety Response Program and community-based service providers that will provide
additional support in the key areas identified or future support through grant funding or contract services. We
hope TBR/HEART will be a major player in the delivery of such services.
With this recommendation, we believe we have heard from residents, the City Council, stakeholders and are
proud to present a proposal to address the needs in the community that will support our most vulnerable
population.
The City will make a recommendation to the City Council for a budget of approximately 3 million dollars to
support the new Department of Community Safety and Alternative Public Safety Response Program. This will
include funding to support personnel and non-contractual items to initiate the program. Included in this
budget is 1-to-1.5-million-dollars for community partners in the provision of contracting with the city to
provide key community services.
We are committed to incorporating the funding for the continuation and expansion of these key services in
Packet Pg. 24
the City Manager’s submitted FY23 budget to the City Council.
