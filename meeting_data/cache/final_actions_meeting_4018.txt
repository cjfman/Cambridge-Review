What is Universal Pre-K?
Universal Pre-K is a policy framework that gives all families with preschool-aged
children the opportunity to voluntarily enroll their child in a publicly-funded
pre-kindergarten care and education program in a given state or community.
• Universal Pre-K may be housed exclusively within a school district or may be
structured as a mixed-delivery system (offering a combination of school-based
and community-based providers).
• Universal Pre-K typically serves children who will meet the Kindergarten age cut-off
date for the following year (essentially 4 year-olds) or it may also serve 3 year-olds
(or a sub-set of 3 year-olds).
• Universal Pre-K may be free for all children or may be subsidized at different levels
depending on family income.
• There are numerous local and state models for UPK and there is no single best
model for how UPK should be designed and implemented.
