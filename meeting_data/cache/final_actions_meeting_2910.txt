in support of affordable housing

Hello,
As a resident of Cambridge, I can personally attest to how unaffordable it increasingly is to live here.
As a scientist leading a company that focuses on how climate change impacts public finance and real estate, I am in
strong agreement with the premise that adding affordable housing supply not only is the right thing to do from a social
and racial equity perspective, but it is also the smartest choice from a long‐term economic perspective for the city.
It will no lot continue to "pay" to allow zoning to constrict housing supply to artificially boost rent prices & home values.
In light of all this I'm a strong proponent of the Missing Middle Housing proposal.
Best,
Evan Kodra

Please support the MMH petition

Hello,
I am writing to express my strong support for the zoning changes proposed in the Missing Middle Housing petition.
Cambridge is a wonderful place to live and it breaks my heart that so many of the young people who start their careers
here are forced out of the city by housing prices when they start families.
Cambridge is also a supremely walkable city and parking minimums have no place here. In our climate crisis, we should
be disincentivizing car ownership and maximizing green space.
I hope you will take this action to end the exclusionary zoning that Cambridge has already determined is a harmful relic
of the past. This is the action we should take, and we should be taking it now.
Thank you for your consideration

OPPOSITION TO MMH CITYWIDE LUXURY HOUSING UP-ZONING PETITION

GET WITH IT CITY COUNCIL. It’s almost embarrassing that the possibility of abandoning the city by supporting this
inappropirate petition is still being entertained. Please WAKE UP!!!
Planning Board Members & City Council Members,
With respect, this is to plead once again to your reasonableness and appeal to your courage to do the right thing
and vote down the “missing middle” up-zoning. The whole effort is a private sector land-grab and, as it is your job
is to plan for and protect the well-being and best interests of the citizens and taxpayers of Cambridge, it is your
responsibility to prevent it, on behalf of the citizens of Cambridge. Its destructive impact will be irreversible and
felt for years to come.
Zoning laws represent civic values, don’t they? Think about the values represented in the existing zoning you want
to abolish — the protection of residents, their property rights, safety, fairness, access, the built and natural
environment, quality of life — many good and important things, vital to the health and life of a city. Cambridge has
always been good at zoning, so why the widespread changes? Have the underlying values changed so much that the
city is ready to abandon them?
The changes allowed by the petition will create even larger barriers to entry to Cambridge for those not earning
tech or professional salaries. It will marginalize the citizens who make the city a diverse, welcoming, dynamic,
attractive place. People struggle and work hard to be able to live here because it’s worth it to them. Why are you
considering a unilateral zoning re-write that will displace them and negatively impact daily life for everyone by
crowding out open space, cutting down trees, and making no provision for the steady increase in cars on the street
with nowhere to park, to name some of the threats?
This petition is an attempt to wrest carte blanch for profit-seeking business interests whose goal is to create
market share for luxury housing by pushing out other types of use. These interests do not need special zoning
unless it’s to take something away from others that the law currently prevents them from doing. Do you want to be
part of forsaking the city in this way? The legacy of the people who built it? The diverse families and communities
who call it home? The dedicated work force that keeps it running?
There are many ways that a vibrant, modern city like Cambridge needs to change and be adaptable. I think you
would find most folks who live here are reasonable people who want and expect it to evolve — especially because
we want it to continue to be a fair, diverse, thriving and accessible place. However, Cambridge will change
irrevocably in the wrong ways if this abdication of zoning controls is allowed to happen. No doubt the board
members and city councilors who have convinced themselves this is in Cambridge’s best interest genuinely believe
it is. Due respect to every individual’s right to their opinion. But in an urgent appeal to your integrity as public
servants, I beg you to reopen your minds and keep thinking objectively, so you see what you are poised to destroy.
If you allow this “anything goes" up-zoning to happen, you will write your place in history as the government that
sold out the City of Cambridge’s renowned liveability, balance, diversity, and character, not to mention its future. In
textbooks on municipal governance, you will be the case study of the administrators and leaders who allowed and
legalized the sell-out of the city to property profiteers who talked you into it. Please don’t let this be your legacy.

Public Comment for 6/7/21

Hello all,
You will be hearing my testimony tonight in strong support of Policy Order 114 and funding for the HEART program, and
in strong opposition to the proposed budget, particularly the increase in the Police Dear. I want to also mention a few
other things that I probably won't have time for.
The first is that I strongly oppose the Missing Middle Housing proposal, and will continue to oppose it as long as it lacks a
guarantee that truly affordable housing will be built. Despite no shortage of critique, the amended proposal continues to
throw in its lot with trickle‐down economics. Market‐rate housing is still way pricier than what many people in
Cambridge can pay. It may help some middle income people in the short run, sure, but in the long run, I fear it will only
exacerbate Cambridge's racial and economic disparities instead of alleviating them as the proposal claims.
If MMH won't guarantee resources for the people most affected by our chronic housing crisis and the most at risk of
being displaced, how is this proposal really addressing or working to ameliorate the crisis? Why are we trying this cynical
approach to our community when we could be doing something to help low‐income residents instead?
The second is that I'm in full support of Resolution 114 regarding the Juneteenth holiday at Harvard. Contracted workers
(who are majority‐minority) are critical and legitimate workers, and should absolutely have Juneteenth off, just as direct
employees do. (All I want for June Christmas is for Harvard to respect its labor force...)
Thank you for reading.

Missing Middle Housing

Dear City Council,
I'm writing to urge you to commit to supporting the changes proposed in the Missing Middle Housing petition when it
comes before the Ordinance Committee this Thursday. We desperately need more market rate housing ‐ the cost of
housing is far too high, even for those of us who do not qualify for affordable housing.
After the Planning Committee's failure to give MMH a fair hearing, it is incumbent on the Organizing Committee to
actually engage with the substance of the proposal and commit to ending exclusionary zoning in Cambridge.
Thank you,

Cambridge Missing Middle Housing

Good morning,
I'm writing this morning to tell you that I strongly support allowing new apartments to be built in residential
neighborhoods. I'm writing to you as someone who works in Cambridge, but not as a Cambridge resident—I can't afford
to live there, not to rent and not to purchase, and this is certainly not a problem affecting me alone. According to
cambridgemmh.org, Current zoning makes it infeasible to build multifamily housing in half of

neighborhoods, and in the other half makes it illegal entirely.

But multifamily housing is the only way I could afford to live in Cambridge, and the message that sends is clear: I'm not
wanted there, and neither is anyone else making 50% AMI or less—or even making less than 120% AMI, as in Cambridge,
1 person making $100,000 year is still qualified to end up on a waiting list or in a lottery for affordable housing.
The current zoning restrictions in Cambridge are exclusionary, and I urge you to do everything you can to make sure
Cambridge can be a home for all.
Sincerely,
Sarah Malley

Missing Middle Housing

To the Cambridge City Councillors,
I am writing in support of the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition.
I am a Cambridge resident with two children in Cambridge's public schools.
Affordable housing is one of the biggest problems in Cambridge. In order to address the crisis, the city needs to change
its restrictive zoning to add more multi‐family housing and smaller units that more people can afford. The current zoning
has roots in racist, classist city planning from a previous century, and the need for reform is urgent. Cambridge must
make way for more housing, and zoning reform is one of the necessary steps.
I feel lucky to live in Cambridge, but I know many people who want to stay and are not able to do so because of housing
costs. Just this past year, one of my child's teachers at a public school in Cambridge had to move out of the city due to
costs. This should not be happening. A Cambridge teacher should be able to buy a condo in Cambridge. Policies that
make it harder to construct this type of middle‐income housing are hurting our city.
I hope that you will vote in favor of the reforms outlined in the Missing Middle Housing petition. It is an excellent chance
to undo some of the harm that we have inherited from city planners of the past. Supporting this petition is one
important step toward a more equitable future.
Sincerely,
Caitlin Hopkins

Support more affordable, sustainable apartments throughout Cambridge

Councilors,
I am writing in support of the missing middle housing petition. We need to allow construction of wood‐built, low‐rise
apartments throughout all residential zones in Cambridge. Even better if no parking is required (better yet, not even
allowed).
First, two or three apartments on a lot will be more affordable than one home on that same lot. That’s just the way it
works because they will be smaller, thereby even if they cost more per square foot, a unit will be cheaper to rent or buy
For an individual or family.
Second, smaller buildings are made with wood, a renewable resource. The city should encourage more wood
construction rather than rely solely on expensive, carbon‐intensive steel and concrete structures for apartment building
Third, reducing parking will reduce car ownership and car use, thereby reducing traffic congestion and emissions. And
no, electric vehicles will not save us from congestion and environmental destruction.
I urge the council to support the petition.
Thank you,
Luis

Missing Middle zoning petition

I understand that the Ordinance Committee is likely to table the MMH petition at its next meeting, and I
heartily hope that the petition is, in fact, tabled.
Were this a perfect world whose only flaw is the lack of high-priced apartments in single-famiy neighborhoods,
the MMH would be a move in the right direction.
But it's not a perfect world, and what the MMH would accomplish, if passed, is to undermine the Affordable
Housing Overlay by making it, once again, more profitable to build market apartments than to build affordable
apartments -- this time in neighborhoods where, prior to passage of the AHO, neither form of development was
feasible.
Thank you.

Missing Middle Housing Petition

Hi,
I'm writing in strong support of the Missing Middle Housing Petition. While I was thrilled with the passage of the
affordable housing overlay, it's clearly not enough. We need to allow for all the types of buildings that have
made Cambridge great, including triple deckers and townhouses that are so characteristic of our
community. Under current zoning, huge swaths of Cambridge's housing stock is illegal. As a huge fan of
Cambridge's dense neighborhood, current zoning policy is an affront.
The affordable overlay allows for the public sector to accelerate housing supply but we need to also allow the
private sector to step in. The petition has been carefully designed to allow for the modest but essential housing
that families of moderate and higher income can afford.
This is my family's number one issue with respect to Cambridge's future. I hope you take a close look at the
petition and consider pushing it forward.
Thank you,
Fernando Hidalgo

Support for the Missing Middle Housing Zoning Petition

Dear Co-chairs Carlone and McGovern and esteemed Councilors,
I want to express my strong support for the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition and to urge you to
to commit your support for the concrete, substantial changes proposed by MMH: allowing triple-deckers
everywhere, removing residential parking mandates, and lifting density caps like minimum lot area per dwelling
unit.
I think this proposal would be an important tool to help our city meet the housing needs of today, as well as for
the future. As an aging Boomer and homeowner who has lived in Cambridge for over 40 years, I too love
today’s Cambridge and want it to remain just as it is.
Yet I feel a stronger commitment to younger and prospective Cantabrigians. I want to ensure that we create
the conditions for a Cambridge that preserves as much diversity as possible – diversity of age, class, race, and
ethnic origin. I want the vibrant young people who are flocking to our fair city, as so many of us did in decades
past, as well as those born and bred in Cambridge, such as my nephew and his friends, to be able to live and
thrive here, along with our city. I want us to create the conditions for neighborhoods that provide the
opportunity to live, work, play and shop in the same area, so as to greatly diminish our reliance on cars, and
protect our environment.
The MMH will allow us to work towards better addressing the housing shortage in Cambridge. It will help to
curb the ever increasing cost of housing by increasing the supply and by allowing for multi-family housing
which is less expensive to build. This will make it easier for working people and minorities, those who grew up
in Cambridge, as well as newer and future residents, to find housing they can afford. It would strengthen our
city’s climate resiliency by removing parking requirements for new construction and by allowing for the kind of
walkable neighborhoods that result in less auto usage.
On behalf of those future and younger generations, I urge you to support the Missing Middle Housing zoning
petition.
Thank you for your consideration.

Hello City Councilors,
I am writing to you in support of the Missing Middle Petition. I am concerned about the lack of medium sized housing
being constructed in Cambridge, MA. There are plenty of areas in our city that are inappropriate for large apartment
complexes yet need denser constructs that are allowable with our zoning laws. Building multi‐unit buildings should be
encouraged over more single family homes in order to meet the needs for our current residents.
In Cambridge, CLRS graduates about 500 students each year. Where are they going to be able to begin their lives
independent of their parents? If our city is not building housing for them, what does this tell them about their future in
our city? Are they no longer welcome in their hometown because we don't have space to house them?
I hear a lot from anti‐housing advocates that building housing will just attract people wanting to move into Cambridge
from the suburbs. But I hear nothing from them addressing what we are doing as a city to house the residents that are
becoming adults and looking to move into their own households.
If we don't do something to build more units in our city, we are telling our next generations that they are not welcome
to stay here. The Missing Middle Housing Petition is a step in the right direction to correct this.
Thanks,
Bryan Doran (he/him)

Please Support Missing Middle Housing Proposal at June 10 Meeting

June 9, 2021
Greetings Cambridge City Councilor,
I am writing in support of the Cambridge Missing Middle Housing zoning
petition before the city Council at the June 10, 2021 meeting.
Like many Cambridge citizens, I live in a building that could not be built
under current zoning laws: an attached four family dwelling in a
Residence B district on a 9,000 square foot lot with insufficient setbacks.
Yet, the property’s generous light, air, and other attributes are enhanced
by the fact that it’s in a walkable neighborhood close enough to shopping
and other amenities that I have not owned a car for over five years.
Like most laws that grew out of movements to eradicate substandard
housing and improve sanitation, Cambridge’s zoning restrictions were
well intended. However, as modifications designated less density and
more parking, our zoning requirements have evolved from a proactive
mechanism to ensure public health into a protective benefit that
generates wealth for property owners. Current zoning requirements
exacerbate three critical issues we face today: they foster
environmentally unsustainable development; reinforce economic
inequality; and entrench racial divisions rooted in the historic bias of
redlining that’s baked into zoning.
It is time to end this institutionalized privilege and create a more livable

Last year the Cambridge City Council approved the Affordable Housing
Overlay (AHO), and applied it across the entire city. I applaud this action.
As a long‐time supporter of local housing developer Just‐A‐Start
Corporation, I know firsthand how AHO is already making it easier to
create more affordable housing in our city.
The Missing Middle Housing zoning proposal is the next step toward a
more environmentally sustainable, economically equalitarian, and racially
integrated city. It extends select incentives of AHO to residential
development of all income spectrums throughout the city; reduces
parking requirements; and reinvigorates middle‐density development
such as townhouses and triple‐deckers: the backbone of livable urban
areas that were our city’s primary residential forms for decades.
The Missing Middle Housing zoning petition is a simple yet bold idea
whose time has come. I look forward to your support of this zoning
proposal as a solid step to creating the best possible Cambridge for all of
us.
Thank you for your consideration and your ongoing service to our city.

Missing Middle Housing: Letter in support

Hello, Cambridge City Council:
I write from Medford as a person who works in Cambridge.
Many of the objections to the MMH proposal stem from the observation that new housing created under the ordinance
won't be designated as "affordable housing."
Cantabrigians' altruistic concern for those having a tough time affording Cambridge housing is laudable. Opposition on
that basis is nevertheless misguided.
While many people who would like to live in Cambridge can't afford to, especially those that work in Cambridge take
comfort in the fact they can still live in other walkable urban communities in metro Boston that will still allow them to
have a semi‐reasonable commute to work and for them to live without a car. It's not a perfect solution, but without
**ANY** plan at all for Cambridge to build so much income‐restricted housing that they can all fit, preserving this
opportunity for would‐be Cantabrigians is vital.
The planning board articulated a concern that the new housing built under the missing middle proposal will be occupied
by techies from Kendall Square. As smaller units will be permitted in more neighborhoods, I think this is a misguided
assumption, and in fact the new housing will be cheaper than the new housing that goes up today. Nevertheless, I think
it would be worth asking where the planning board *wants* techies to live. Does the board wish for them to buy cars
and move to Maynard or up to New Hampshire, undermining Cambridge's stated goals to solve climate change? Does
the board wish for them to move to Allston or Malden or Chelsea, offloading Cambridge's affordability problems onto
poorer communities with less money to deal with it?
Concerns about displacement of certain vulnerable communities *within* Cambridge are nevertheless legitimate, and
the city should certainly spend some of its money to help prevent displacement. Cambridge should also adjust zoning to
allow more affordable housing development, such as the one proposed at 2072 Massachusetts Ave. But rejecting the
Missing Middle Housing proposal in order to prevent their displacement is folly.
Doing so offers *no* guarantees that the displacement won't occur anyway. And if it does, all the worse for those
displaced when they find that Cambridge's exclusionary policies have sent even fairly rich apartment‐hunters
throughout the region to find housing they can afford. While today those worried about displacement may take comfort
in the fact that they could at least move to Medford, Malden, Lynn or Chelsea and have a reasonable way to get to work,
in the future they may have to consider commuting from Worcester, Lowell, or some yet more distant city.
If Cantabrigians are interested in preserving the environment and in altruistically speaking up for those who have less,
they should support the petition, which will permit more people to live and work in Cambridge, rather than forcing
middle‐income and poor alike to look for housing elsewhere.
Even if housing in Cambridge remains pricey, everyone who gets an apartment there is a person who is *NOT* causing
traffic on The Pike, and is someone who is *NOT* bidding up housing prices somewhere else in the region (or some
poorer neighborhood within Cambridge!). And this might not be perfect, but we can't hold out for perfection: we need
to take whatever wins we can get.

I've also written before about the idea of increasing the tax on land values (while potentially decreasing the tax on
buildings). This reform would help address some of the concerns about land value uplifts from proposals like this one.
More generally, it will permit the city to benefit from rising land values, will discourage holding land out of use to profit
off appreciation, but while not discouraging productive investment in the buildings that the city needs to grow and
welcome more people. I remain enthusiastic about this policy and its power to help address the housing crisis and I am
happy to work with interested Councillors on investigating further.

Besides the missing middle housing proposal as a whole, I hope that even the skeptical will support the portion of the
proposal that repeals parking minimums city‐wide. Mandating space for cars in a dense urban city simply doesn't serve
any progressive goals.

Support for Missing Middle Housing

Dear members of the Cambridge City Council,
I live in Cambridgeport, and this is my first time sending comments to the Council. I am asking you to adopt the MMH
zoning petition to help ensure that our community is welcoming for all.
Envision Cambridge said that "Only broad market affordability will maintain Cambridge as a community for everyone.
Cambridge should lead the region to increase local and regional housing supply." My story shows that more small,
relatively affordable market housing is necessary to protect Cambridge tenants.
When I moved to Cambridge two years ago, I was working as an AmeriCorps legal advocate at Greater Boston Legal
Services. Now, I am studying in law school. If my partner and I weren't able to rent this one‐bedroom garden level
apartment, there are not very many other options that we could afford in Cambridge. I feel very lucky to be able to live
here!
Passing MMH and allowing more inexpensive, small units (studios, one‐ or two‐bedroom) instead of large detached
homes will mean that tenants like me can afford to live in Cambridge.
Thank you,
Ariella Katz

Missing Middle Housing Petition Comment

Esteemed councilors,
I would like to express my strong support for the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition. There are many reasons to
support this petition, and I want to outline some of the reasons I find most compelling
Access to Opportunity:
The Petition would increase the quantity of housing built in our city, and thus enable more people to enjoy the
enormous opportunity and quality of life that our City offers. As a CRLS graduate, I know that I owe much of what
success in life I have enjoyed to the institutions and general atmosphere of opportunity that exist in Cambridge. It is our
obligation, I think, to expand these opportunities as best we can. To do so, we must expand our housing stock.
Climate Change:
As I know Councilors recognize, we are living in a decisive moment for climate action. Research from Berkeley
demonstrates that by far the most effective local policy solution to address climate change is the addition of more units
of infill housing‐ [1]‐these units are less energy‐intensive than older and larger units, and moreover cities (such as
Cambridge) are more environmentally friendly than suburbs, exurbs, and rural areas. Furthermore, I imagine and hope
that future municipal legislation will only increase the climate‐friendliness of new construction in Cambridge.
The MMH also has two specific points in favor of it. First, it adds density in a way that is congruent with much of the
existing housing stock. Second, it would do so in a way that removes a form of zoning‐‐single‐family‐only‐‐that has been
used as a tool of exclusion. I am glad that the Council has, in principle, agreed that single‐family‐only zoning has to go. It
is my hope that Councilors will pursue this by, as a first step, enacting the provisions of MMH.

Many Thanks,

Missing Middle Housing

Dear Councilors
Thanks for your attention to this important matter. By now, the arguments for and against the Missing Middle Housing
petition are well known. As a member of the group that has been working on this for the past 9 months, I have learned
much about the history of zoning, the impact of zoning decisions on our community, and the political realities of zoning
reform. I come away from this experience feeling very confident that zoning reform is difficult but necessary.
Current residential zoning in Cambridge is the result of a century of political, social and economic priorities that have
changed over time. We are at a moment in which those priorities have shifted significantly enough that our zoning is no
longer aligned with them. In fact, the zoning process is in many ways antithetical to our collective values:
Exclusionary zoning, in which certain areas of the city are deemed more valuable and precious than other areas is no
longer an acceptable proposition. This codifies and reinforces social‐economic strata in a community that prides itself
on working against such structures.
Mandatory parking reinforces and eases the use of automobiles at a moment in which we need to quickly shed our
automobile dependency. The land area that is used for our automobiles is valuable and should be used for open space
or homes.
Middle‐density housing, that is so familiar to us in Cambridge, is the most environmentally sound and appropriately
scaled type of housing for our neighborhoods. Yet it is banned in most of Cambridge. Instead, developers build free‐
standing, single‐family homes, because that is what they are able to do quickly and legally ‐ without lengthy, expensive ,
unpredictable zoning variances.
The Missing Middle Housing Petition is not perfect. It is not an Affordable Housing initiative. It will not transform
Cambridge overnight. But it embraces strategic elements of the smartest, most progressive urban land reform
happening in progressive cities across the country right now. We look forward to working with you and the Community
Development Department to implement it.
Thank you,
Bill Boehm

In support of MMH Petition

Dear Councilors,
I am writing to express my support for the Missing Middle Housing Petition. This is a critical and needed
change to Cambridge's zoning which will help to provide more naturally affordable market‐rate housing to the
hundreds of thousands of people looking for a home in the greater Boston area, advance the city's climate
goals by providing denser housing[1], and help to alleviate price increases ‐ even in neighborhoods with a
higher population at‐risk for displacement [2].
The petition envisions a welcoming future for Cambridge where we make space for newcomers and aligns
with Envision Cambridge's goals towards serving those who live here, those who grew up here and want to
stay close, and those who come here looking for opportunity. The petition does so by proposing meaningful
changes to our current zoning regime, one which was forged through a racist and classist history and should
be critically examined [3, 4].
There are many ways we can enact a vision which consigns this history to the dustbin, and the MMH petition is
a vital tool to do so. We must move beyond a status quo which allows single‐family homes to sail through
permitting unchallenged, while modest 4‐family homes face a gauntlet of planning board and other process
impediments. This is a fundamental asymmetry which the city government is propping up in favor of the
wealthy, and it must end.
Finally, there is understandable concern about the effects of development on neighborhoods with populations
at‐risk for displacement. There is an emerging consensus among professionals and academics that even the
localized impacts of development tend to result in lower rents for surrounding buildings[1, 5, 6, 7, 8] ‐ and
there is no doubt that providing more homes lowers the cost of housing in the region. We can use this petition
to help bring market rate in reach of the middle class of Cambridge, and we can do so by moving beyond the
zero‐sum thinking which pervades our local politics and realizing that all benefit from more places to live.
Thank you,
Pawel Latawiec

Missing Middle Housing

To the Cambridge City Council
I am a Cambridge resident and homeowner, and also a professor in Harvard University. I am writing to express my strong
support for the "Missing Middle Housing" petition.
My two children have been in the Cambridge public school system for 9 years. In that time, I have seen time and again
families move out of the city because they are priced out of it. In particular a recurring pattern among my daughter's
classmates has been that immigrant and low income students end up needing to leave the city when their family's
economic situation improves and they want to move out of affordable housing to a place of their own. My daughter’s
middle school lost several students to this pattern: friends and schoolmates that have been with her since kindergarten
but just couldn’t stay in Cambridge.
I also live in Walden street, and I see that all new construction around me is one or two detached single family homes, in
lots that are easily big enough to fit denser housing such as triple deckers, row houses, or small apartment buildings.
If we want Cambridge to be a city that is not just for the very wealthy, but where young families can buy an apartment
and make their home, then we need to act now. I was very impressed with the thought given into the MMH petition and
especially the amendments that ensure it will not compete with the affordable housing overlay. The MMH proponents
are well aware that it only addresses part of the housing issues, and we also need more affordable housing as well
(including the 2072 Mass Ave project, which I also wrote to support).
In truth, building denser units in my area is probably against the short‐term interests of home owners and car drivers
like me. Parking will be harder and traffic in the already blocked Walden‐Mass Ave intersection will get worse. But the
long term way to address this is not by having fewer people but by having fewer cars.
Best,
Boaz Barak

MMH zoning petition

Please count me among those of your constituents who support the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition.
My reasons are mostly the same as those you’ve heard from the petitioners. But you may not have heard
about (or read) the many social‐media posts by exceptionally talented middle‐income international students
who couldn’t attend Cambridge’s leading universities for one reason: shared off‐campus housing wasn’t
available in their price range.
Nearly a third of Harvard’s graduate students (and a quarter of MIT’s) are international. (“Student Enrollment
Data,” https://oir.harvard.edu/fact‐book/enrollment.) International‐student groups have, however, generally
shied away from advocating for local political issues like middle‐income housing, mostly for cultural reasons.
And the most influential statewide student political group, Mass College Dems, expended a lot of its political
capital last year in an ad hominem attack on Alex Morse (now mayor of Provincetown). Still, Cambridge was
organized in 1636 to become the site for Harvard College — and we ought to keep students’ needs in mind.
Full Disclosure of Interests. I’m an MIT Alumni member. I’ve polled MIT graduate students in Cambridge Ward
5 as a Democratic ward committee member. I otherwise have no significant financial arrangement or
affiliation with any organization discussed in my message, or any competing organization.

Ordinance Committee (Ordinance #2021-2)

Dear Co-Chairs Carlone and McGovern, Members of the Ordinance Committee,
I write about the Missing Middle Petition, which I strongly oppose. Rumor is rife that the Ordinance
Committee will take no public commentary tomorrow evening and even that written testimony will not
be accepted, so I hope that is not true. It is extremely difficult for the public to express its views when
the rules change meeting to meeting without prior notification.
This petition should be tabled. Even before the extensive proposed amendments which make
significant major changes to the petition and should be grounds enough to table, the petition would
have increased housing costs, resulted in more single-family luxury houses instead of much needed
affordable housing, decreased critical open space, ignored the need for infrastructure (including
water, electricity, schools, libraries, grocery stores, etc., etc., etc.), and further damaged the tree
canopy we so badly need to improve.
Parking is, unfortunately, a necessary component of any development. Although we should
encourage those who can do so, not everyone is able to walk to public transportation (which is far
from adequate) or ride a bicycle. People who work outside of Cambridge or at odd hours of the day
cannot rely on public transit. Parents with children must often rely on private vehicles to maintain their
busy schedules and in emergencies. People who care for the elderly and the sick need the flexibility a
car provides.
Let’s start planning with a holistic approach. Cambridge has so much to recommend it, but we are
already incredibly dense and need to be smart in solving our housing problems without destroying our
city. We need to carefully weigh all the consequences of our proposed actions to really improve life
for all our residents.

Re: [Ordinance Committee}]- MMH - the "middle" part of the "missing middle" petition is missing

June 9, 2021
Honorable Council - Sitting as Ordinance Committee:
I write in the strongest opposition to the so-called "Missing Middle Housing" petition, by submitting
herewith the remarks I provided previously to the Planning Board on this same subject.
As long as there have been rules, people have been trying to bend the rules or break them - for
pleasure, or money, or both. But rules set limits, and limits have traditionally been dictated by
common sense. The average automobile today can cruise all day at 75 mph and reach well over 100
mph with ease. But Cambridge’s speed limits are 25mph on large streets and 20mph in our far more
prevalent densely-settled areas. That’s just common sense. Speed kills. And nobody wants to be
killed.
With the advent of steel frameworks, we have been able to construct buildings over 100 feet tall since
1890. Yet the average home height in Cambridge is closer to 30 feet. That’s just common
sense. Nobody wants to live in the shadow of a skyscraper like 107-foot-high William James Hall if
they can avoid it. And zoning rules were created so we can avoid it.
But builders want to build. And builders like the National Association of Home Builders - located in
the political power center of Washington DC - are not controlled by the needs or wishes of Cambridge
MA residents. NAHB spends millions of dollars lobbying to break down zoning limits so they can
build as much and as big as they can. The latest NAHB gambit is “Missing Middle Housing” which its
own website defines as:
“a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types, compatible in scale with detached singlefamily homes” ... called “middle ... because of its scale and because of its ability to deliver
affordability to middle-income households.”
On February 3, 2021 Cambridge resident Carolyn Fuller et al. submitted a “Missing Middle Housing
Zoning Petition” now before you. It is posted on a website which claims it is designed to:
“put an end to exclusionary zoning in Cambridge” and “counter ‘racist, classist’ rules which
encourage wasteful land use, produce more expensive housing, and help keep the city
economically and racially segregated.”
Not surprisingly, the Fuller MMH Petition garnered a lot of on-line support based on those claims. But
applied to Cambridge, even the NAHB definition it derives from has major flaws. One person who
has for years been very much concerned with the needs and wishes of Cambridge residents is
Robert Winters who puts it this way:

Cambridge needs and has the talent to develop zoning refinements that respond to conditions that
actually exist in Cambridge and that are designed to improve the quality of life for all who live and
work in Cambridge. The Missing Middle petition is exactly the opposite.
We now hear that a raft of major amendments are being proposed to make this poorly-drafted falselysold petition more palatable. But no end of amendments will cure this MMH petition’s glaring flaws,
any more than major foot surgery is a practical way to fit a foot into a wrong-size wrong-shape boot.
This MMH petition should be withdrawn by its sponsors or tabled by your Ordinance Committee so
Cambridge's abundant talent can be concentrated on developing zoning that meets Cambridge's real
needs.

It’s also worth noting that there’s really nothing in the petition that would in any way ensure that
the chief beneficiaries would be middle class residents. The petition is primarily a vehicle for
increasing densities and this could just as easily translate into larger homes for those who can
afford them or the freedom to add on significant additions to existing homes. In other words,
the "middle" part of the "missing middle" petition is missing.- RW

Missing MIddle Housing - zoning petition.

Dear City Council Members,
As a North Cambridge resident since 1994, a former member and chair of the Planning Board, and a professional urban
planning consultant with nearly 30 years of experience all over the country, I am writing to support the Missing Middle
Housing (MMH) zoning petition. The MMH petition would allow small, 2‐4 unit buildings in all Cambridge residential
neighborhoods, eliminating exclusionary zoning.
The 20th‐century zoning system we have today is based on separated, homogenous land uses, uniform dimensional
requirements, and protection of single‐family housing as the top priority‐‐an exclusionary system. It was imposed over
decades in Cambridge, but was never a good fit for our city. Many residential streets in Cambridge today still have a
mixture of building types with limited on‐site parking ‐‐ like my own street in a Res B (two‐family) zoning district, where
over half the buildings are non‐conforming triple‐deckers and the rest are singles and doubles. Triple‐deckers were
stigmatized in the 19teens as tenements for working class immigrants, but they have proven to be a durable and
appealing housing choice over the last century, serving the city's diverse population and households. We have long
permitted residential redevelopment of former industrial buildings adjacent to typical residential housing, so why should
small multi‐unit buildings be excluded in any zoning district in the city?
The current zoning system in Cambridge is outdated as well as exclusionary. It does not align with the housing needs of
the city's diverse households, the movement away from car ownership towards alternative transportation, and the
decarbonization of our economy. Adoption of the Missing Middle zoning amendment will provide Cambridge residents
with more flexibility over the medium‐ and long‐term in meeting Envision Cambridge goals for sustainability, equity, and
affordability. No single initiative is an immediate silver bullet to achieve these goals, but MMH zoning is an essential
step to modernize our regulatory regime to achieve our goals for the 21st century.

Opposition to the "Missing Middle" housing proposal

Dear members of the Cambridge City Council and City Clerk:
We understand that the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council will consider the socalled "Missing Middle" housing petition on June 10, 2021. We urge you to reject this proposal

for the construction of housing projects in Cambridge because, as currently designed, it
would weaken important zoning regulations, which make Cambridge attractive, and also
because it does not provide for any increase in the amount of housing that people making
the median income and less can afford.
We support the phasing out of zoning for exclusively single-family housing but believe than any new
system should mandate affordability and historic preservation, as proposed in the Donavan Petition,
which was filed in July 2020 but never acted upon by the city. We also urge the Ordinance
Committee to maintain strict design and environmental requirements in any new zoning system.
Thank you for considering our opinion.

Missing Middle Housing

Dear City Council,
I support the Missing Middle Housing zoning petition for the numerous reasons outlined in the MMH flier. As a
Cambridge resident, architect and local small business owner, this is an important issue to me.
It's disheartening that so many hard working people, even upper middle‐class families and individuals, cannot afford to
own their homes here in Cambridge. Meanwhile, developers are reducing our housing stock by converting 2‐family and
multi‐family buildings into single family homes. This zoning‐approved development only benefits a few wealthy
individuals.
The Missing Middle Housing makes many good points for adding housing, as well as increasing patterns of racial and
economic segregation; adding new housing with smaller scale developments; concerns with a culture of overlooking the
exploitative and overcrowded (illegal) rental housing market; and current development standards that conflict with the
city's environmental goals.
I hope the City Council supports this petition and is not swayed by the boisterous NIMBY‐ism that seems too content
with the current housing crisis in Cambridge...seemingly because they have theirs and too bad for everyone else.
I am optimistic that the City Council will support the long term benefits and overall fairness in this petition.
Thank you,
Dave

Strongly support missing middle petition

Dear City Council,
Please support the missing middle petition because:


Our zoning shouldn't look like 1930s redlining. That's racist.
Our zoning shouldn't incentivize cars. That's bad for the planet (and people's health).
Our zoning should allow for beautiful new housing like what already exists. We love it and need more!
Our zoning shouldn't encourage expensive McMansions. It should encourage affordable housing like the 2x2
nonconforming flat (technical term escaping me) that I live in with many exciting young professionals.
Our zoning shouldn't encourage lots of paved spaces. We need soil to absorb excess rain (formerly flooded Port
resident speaking here!).

But more than all of those reasons, I'm losing all my friends who want to settle down to the outskirts/Suburbs — they
want to stay, but can't afford it. Here is a partial list of my missing friends:










Elina — moved from C‐Port to E. Cambridge [to buy an apt]
Suelin & Dave — moved to Somerville from Mid‐Cambridge [to have a family]
Alfa & Alfa (these are actually 2 different people, a man and a woman; they're Ethiopian) — moved from
Cambridgeport to Newton [to have a family]
Ani — moved from Port to Somerville
Anna — about to move from Mid‐Cambridge [house‐hunting in the actual burbs]
Andrew & Meg — moved from C‐port to Medford [to have a family]
Katie & Rick — moving from Port to Newton in Sept [to make space for their family]
Jackson — moved from E. Camb to Medford
Nate — moved from Port to Somerville
Tracy & Mark — moved from C‐port (near her restaurant Pagu) to Lexington [now has 2 babies]
Jesse & Rachel — (ironically) moved from Wellington‐Harrington to JP [to buy a home and have a family]
Alexandra & Jeff — (also ironic) moved from C‐Port to JP [to buy a home and have a new baby Sam born on May
22!]

Every year this list gets longer. All these people wanted to stay in Cambridge. Expensive housing made that impossible.
There's nothing better than community and friends; there's nothing worse than seeing them leave. I miss having my
friends near!
As people with the power to do something about this: please help bring housing prices down in Cambridge!
Thank you,

Strong support for Missing Middle Housing

To Ordinance Committee Members,
I wanted to write again strongly supporting the Missing Middle Housing petition, coming before
the Ordinance Committee June 10. As Niko Bowie so eloquently put it at the Planning Board
meeting on 5/11/21 why do we keep restrictive zoning in place when it has caused such racial and
class segregation? Here is an opportunity to undo one aspect of these anti-density rules that
have prevented the construction of multi-family housing in all areas of the city. He implored us
to legalize the building of all types of housing. Opponents argue there isn't enough of a
guarantee of affordability in this petition, but of course we should continue to work to increase
the supply of housing affordable to the most vulnerable. That shouldn't be a reason not to
remove the restrictions on building denser housing that exist now. Supporting this petition is
promoting true diversity and it's something within the power of a local government to change.
Thank you.

Missing middle petition

Dear City Council,
I strongly support the missing middle petition because I believe we live in a city that wants to:
 end racism/increasing diversity
 increase socio‐economic diversity
 be inclusive/welcoming
 bring down housing prices
 reduce car pollution

But our current zoning rules do not align with any of the above goals, and many seem to have been (historically but
intentionally) designed to do the opposite. The current zoning rules increase disparities and drive families out of the city
in order to find an affordable place to live and raise children.
I've lived in Area 4 since 2003; first as a long‐time renter, and finally as a property owner in 2018. My husband and I love
Cambridge and are committed to raising our children here. We care about this community and hope the City Council
can work to amend the zoning rules to make them more in line with the values and ideals of the residents of this
community.
Thank you,
Hillary Kelly

Support Missing Middle Housing

Dear Ordinance Committee Members,
I write to support the Missing Middle Housing petition.
When my husband and I moved back to Cambridge in 2004, we rented an apartment in a two‐family in Cambridgeport
with another house in the backyard. We saved up and purchased a 1,000 square‐foot single‐family townhouse nearby.
After eight years, we sold that home and purchased a larger townhouse condo in East Cambridge, where my husband
and I currently live with our two young daughters.
What do all of our homes in Cambridge have in common? They are all a type of housing rarely permitted to be built or
expanded in Cambridge today due to exclusionary or “snob” zoning—Missing Middle Housing. Missing Middle Housing
allows young people and families like ours the chance to get a toehold in Cambridge, and the importance of such
housing has only grown in the wake of Cambridge’s housing crisis. As our housing costs have skyrocketed, the ability to
follow this path and move from renting to owning has become nearly impossibly for all but the wealthiest Cantabrigians.
In addition, the Missing Middle Housing petition allows denser housing and eliminates parking minimums, providing
significant environmental benefits to our community and region in the form of less energy and gas usage. It also legalizes
existing housing, allowing homeowners to renovate their homes with less cumbersome and costly review processes.
Further, ending exclusionary zoning, a frequent tool used to ensconce structural racism, is a positive end in itself.
For these reasons, I strongly support the Missing Middle Housing petition and encourage you to join me in supporting a
more equitable, diverse, and environmentally sustainable Cambridge.
Thank you,
Erin McHugh Saif

Missing Middle Housing

Dear Council,
I'm writing to urge you to pass the Missing Middle Housing petition. I'm 25, I cannot emphasize enough that everyone I
grew up with here in Cambridge assumes that if they want to own a home on their own, they have to leave Cambridge.
None of them want to, and some of them, from police officers or to people who work for Amazon, make a lot of money
and they still don't think they can stay here.
They don't think they can stay here because there simply aren't enough options, and that's because options are zoned
out of our housing policy. The remnants of a more open, pre‐zoning code Cambridge are the only "middle" type housing
options. Take this condo for example. It was built in 1910 and I doubt the structure would be legal under current zoning.
The condo is 800 square feet and is estimated at $795K. That's crazy. If there were more condos in more buildings like
this one because we made it legal to build such structures again, then maybe a 110 year old 2 bedroom wouldn't be so
expensive. But because our zoning code has made it an antique relic, it's out of range for a middle class buyer.
We need to allow more apartments and multi‐family housing units in Cambridge. We can't just talk about it, or even
"eliminate single family zoning" without doing anything about the setback, FAR and parking rules that really determine
what can be built here. Our future character of the city depends on it, and I don't mean neighborhood character. I mean
who actually gets to live here.
Thank you,
Michael Hoff

Missing Middle Zoning housing Petition, June 10, 2021

Dear City Councilors,
I am writing to encourage you to oppose the Missing Middle Zoning Petition. This proposal would allow forprofit developers to create more luxury housing for largely White high tech, biotech, and other
professional/managerial class people and make it increasingly impossible for low-income, immigrant, and
disabled residents and people of color to afford high quality housing in Cambridge.
Do members of the City Council really want to continue to give away our city to the interests of commercial
developers, high paying businesses, and high-income buyers? Where is your commitment to serving the needs
of the most vulnerable residents who need affordable, safe, high quality housing so that they and their children
can live decent, stable lives?
You are supposed to serve the needs and promote the present and future wellbeing of the most vulnerable
amongst us, not serve the economic interests of the commercial developers.
Affordable, high quality housing is a HUMAN RIGHT. If you are not willing to provide housing for the most
vulnerable and economically needy residents of the City of Cambridge, you should resign and give your
position to somebody who is willing to advocate for the wellbeing of our most vulnerable and needy members
of this community.
Please vote your conscience and OPPOSE this proposal. Start providing affordable high-quality housing for
low-income residents.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Hunter Aldrich

MMH petition

Hello,
My name is Peter Williams, I currently live at 35 Homer Avenue in West Cambridge, and I'm writing to express my strong
support for the Missing Middle Housing petition. While I recognize that MMH will likely have to be tabled for the time
being, I hope that the Council will really engage with its ideas over the coming months and return to it with enthusiasm
when the calendar permits.
I personally won't be around to support MMH the next time around because this spring I needed to buy a home where I
could start my family, and because I'm not ultra‐privileged ("only" very‐privileged), the idea of being able to afford such
a home in Cambridge was LAUGHABLE. So I'm moving to Watertown. I'm not asking anyone to feel sorry for me — I'll be
just fine — but I'll admit that I was pretty ticked off to see how many wealthy and complacent homeowners were, in
effect, eager to tell me to get lost. Seems unhealthy!
MMH won't solve Cambridge's housing crisis on its own, but I thought that Niko Bowie on the Planning Board did a great
job of explaining why so many of us feel that it's so urgent; hopefully you've seen these videos before:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3eEJZqCDu0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx8Ht3KAPKc
Normally I aim to be positive and constructive, but since is is probably my last communication to the City Council, I'll go
ahead and add that as I've gotten more interested in local housing policy, I've started attending meetings of groups such
as the Planning Board and the BZA, and they've been ... terrible. With the notable exception of Niko, the members have
generally been out‐of‐touch, complacent, bureaucratically incompetent, passive, narrow‐minded. The City should be
embarrased to have such important activities in their hands. Cambridge is full of folks like Niko, and the Council should
find a way to give them as much authority as they're willing to take on!
Thank you for your time,
Peter Williams

Missing Middle Zoning Petition

Dear Councilors,
I am writing to you to ask you not to support the Middle Missing Housing Petition. This proposal allows for‐profit
developers to create more luxury housing with NO requirement that they build ANY affordable housing. It will NOT help
remedy racial disparities in Cambridge. It WILL push out low and middle‐income community members, including many
people of color, from Cambridge.
Proponents argue that increasing the amount of market‐rate housing will lower the cost of existing housing. There is no
evidence that this will happen. Rather, in highly desirable cities like Cambridge, building more market-rate
housing generally drives up the cost of housing, thereby gentrifying neighborhoods and fueling the
displacement of low and middle-income people. This is because the demand for market-rate housing in
Cambridge is inexhaustible in the foreseeable future.
Additionally, creating more market-rate housing will not address racial inequality. There is no provision in the
petition that units go to people who have been historically excluded from housing. Nor is there any evidence
that many black or brown people will be able to purchase. Planning Board estimates that units would market at
$1,000 per square foot. It would therefore require access to wealth or an income well over $100k annually to
purchase these units. Clearly this does not address the needs of either middle income or those most
vulnerable to housing instability and displacement, low- income people. Racial inequality in housing is better
addressed by social housing, rent control and other tenant protections, community land trusts and limitedequity co-ops. Building more housing aimed at high income , largely white individuals would not.
Finally, there are additional adverse environmental consequences. By reducing the current 30 to 50% open
space requirement to 25% there is less room for trees, which according to the CDD could have detrimental
climate consequences.
What is important is that we need to think creatively about how we address two growing crisis; housing and global
warming. This proposal does neither.
Thank you,
Lynne Hall

Please vote against the Missing Middle Petition

To the Council:
As the Ordiance Committee considers the Missing Middle Petition this evening, we urge you to vote against further
consideration of this proposal. Contrairy to what this proposal implies, it will do nothing to help ease the housing crisis
for low and middle income families and will not combate racism in housing. The Cambridge Planning Board estimates
that units built from this proposed change would market for $1000 per square foot. Thus, a 1000 square foot condo
would sell for one million dollars. Therefore this is clearly housing for fairly wealthy people. It will do nothing to help
middle income individuals and families or those most vulnerable to housing instability and displacement, low‐income
people. And it certainly will not help BIPOC families, few of whom have access to this amount of money. Proponents
argue that increasing the amount of market‐rate housing will lower the cost of existing housing. There is no evidence
that this will happen. Rather, in highly desirable cities like Cambridge, building more market‐rate housing generally
drives up the cost of housing, thereby gentrifying neighborhoods and fueling the displacement of low and middle‐
income people. This is because the demand for market‐rate housing in Cambridge is inexhaustible in the foreseeable
future for several reasons. First, Cambridge encourages commercial development for high‐paying businesses such as bio‐
tech and information technology. This leads to an influx of relatively wealthy professional and technical workers who put
further pressure on our market‐rate housing. Second, wealthy investors find the real estate market attractive and they
buy empty units hoping for an increase in value and then a sale. Many of these investors never move to Cambridge and
keep units vacant, further driving up the cost of housing. Finally there is also housing demand from suburban empty
nesters.
The proponents of the Missing Middle petition argue that ending single‐ and two‐family zoning will help to redress racial
inequality. Although it is true that single‐family zoning is rooted in a racist past, there is no reason to believe that the
current proposal would redress that wrong. Certainly, there is no provision in the petition that units go to people who
have been historically excluded from housing. Nor is there any evidence that a significant number of Black or brown
people will be able to purchase. As Stephanie Guirand of The Black Response recently argued in the Cambridge Day,
“Asking for‐profit developers to fix the affordable housing problem is like asking an arsonist to put out their own fire.
What is their incentive? Up‐zoning without strategic government intervention rooted in a community process serves to
reinforce the underlying failures of zoning, resulting in further segregation and race and class stratification.” Racial
inequality in housing is better addressed by social housing, rent control and other tenant protections, community land
trusts, and limited‐equity co‐ops. Specifically supporting and funding these solutions would serve as a powerful form of
reparations for the harm done by past housing policies. Building more housing aimed at high income, largely white
individuals would not.
There are also a number of other unintended consequences. First, increasing the number of units allowed, increases the
value of land, making it more difficult to build low and middle housing. In fact, the Cambridge Development Department
concluded that: “[The proposal] would reduce the net additional benefit to affordable housing developments provided by
the Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) compared to market‐rate development. The Petition could make development
sites more attractive for market‐rate housing, resulting in more competition for sites that might otherwise be acquired
for affordable housing and potentially fewer opportunities for affordable housing development in residential
neighborhoods.” As written, the proposal may not even increase the number of units on a lot. The Community
Development Department has observed that it is “possible that the zoning could result in larger dwellings if property
owners prefer to enlarge existing units or create new larger units instead of adding a greater number of smaller units.”

Finally, the Missing Middle will have adverse environmental consequences. The proposal would reduce the current 30 to
50% open space requirement to 25% which means there is less room for trees, which according to the CDD could have
detrimental climate consequences. The proposal would allow denser housing with less open space even in the densest
parts of Cambridge such as the Port and North Cambridge that already have substantial amounts of new housing being
built in backyards or by tearing down houses; such development would particularly cause displacement of Black and
brown residents. Alternatively, we could build on other sites in ways that would not have this effect. For example, the
municipal golf course could be turned into a space that had both a large park with oxygen‐generating trees and
substantial amounts of low and middle‐income housing ‐‐ far more than the Missing Middle rezoning could ever create.
This is only one possible alternative. What is important here, is that we need to think creatively about how we address
two growing crises; housing and global warming.
For all these reasons, we urge you to vote against the Missing Middle and look to other solutions such as building more
social housing, community land trusts, and tenant protections such as rent control to solve our housing crisis. We all
agree that we need more housing for middle and low‐income people. The Missing Middle, however, is not the solution
and may in fact be harmful for achieving this goal.

Dear Councillors,
In spite of assertions by the proponents of the "missing Middle" zoning proposal, adopting the zoning rules in the
proposal achieves none of the goals in the Envision statement. Specifically, it does not contain any provisions to directly
lead to affordable housing for low‐income and middle income residents. It also disregards limits on reducing tree
canopies. It is an invitation for developers to creates market rate housing, ie. luxury housing.
This proposal must be defeated.

The Missing Middle rezoning proposal

Hi City Councillors:
You have been hearing from me on many issues lately, and I have to confess, that as a 40 year resident
of Cambridge, I have been shocked that my very pleasantly progressive city has a police department with
so much military-grade equipment, is so misinformed and mislead about the actions of the Israeli
apartheid regime that it cannot even take the mildest actions to support the rights of Palestinians, and,
now, is considering a housing development proposal that does not include any requirement for affordable
housing, nor require units go to people who have historically been excluded from decent housing through
red-lining and other such racist practices.
As a homeowner who could barely afford to buy almost 40 years ago, I would much rather see my city
institute rent control, community land trusts, limited equity co-ops and other creative, and just, ways of
addressing past inequitable housing policies. This would keep us a vibrant, diverse, progressive
community.
Sincerely,
Marilyn Frankenstein

Missing Middle Housing Petition

Dear Cambridge city council,
I'm a resident of Cambridge and live at 88 Hancock St. I'm writing in support of the Missing Middle Housing zoning
petition being considered. I have lived in Cambridge for the past 6 years and have loved it. I think there are few places in
the US where someone can walk to work everyday, walk to their favorite restaurants, beer gardens, and cafes, and run
into friends at the park or on a run on a regular basis. This is because Cambridge is dense and geographically small, made
possible by the abundant triple deckers that so many young families live in.
As much as I have loved living here, I am torn about my future in Cambridge, as I know many of my peers are, due to the
extremely high cost of living here. Sharing an apartment with roommates is one way many younger residents make living
here affordable, but for young couples starting families and building wealth through buying a home, living here long‐
term is just not viable. It's clear that for the vast majority of people looking to live and work in Cambridge, multifamily
housing is the only option for renting or buying. I can think of nothing more luxurious in Cambridge than a single‐family
home in the heart of the city and it seems absurd that it is legal to tear down triple deckers and other
apartment buildings and replace them with single family homes but that the reverse is illegal in most places.
Almost everyone claims to agree that there is a housing crisis in Cambridge but it seems that every time something is
proposed to address it, a wave of pushback appears from those who are content with (and who benefit from) the status
quo. If Cambridge is indeed the progressive community I thought it was, it urgently needs to adopt the MMH petition
and others like it designed to address this crisis.

Mary May

I oppose the Missing Middle proposal

I have lived and voted in Cambridge for almost 50 years, and I would not/could not be living here today, if
not for affordable housing.
Here's why I oppose this discriminatory measure:



Not only does it end zoning that only allows single- or two-family homes to be built in certain
areas of Cambridge,
It allows larger buildings throughout the city to be built with less associated green space than
is currently allowed and no longer requires parking spaces to be included.

The so-called Missing Middle:
o does not require a single unit of affordable housing on these proposed lots.
o does nothing to address contemporary racist housing practices.

Dear Co-Chairs,
I am hoping you will allow the Missing Middle Up-zoning petition to fade away because, with its new
spontaneous amendments, it is no longer the petition originally presented. It is also unfair that that
faction who both presented and promoted it continues to have a platform where those questioning its
validity as written are relegated to 2 minutes. This proposed plan affects 83% of the city’s land and 53%
of residences. This is not to be taken lightly and will have great consequences.
As with the cherry-picked AHO, the Missing Middle Housing (MMH) is based on the unfinished, unfinalized Envision Cambridge. To combine 5 distinct districts into a single blanket “N” district
disregarding their needs and zoning differences is the height of arrogance and ignorance. It eliminates
protections in favor of increased density at any cost. We still lack an impact study and resident outreach.
This is city-wide petition is being imposed on an uniformed public yet again.
This petition allows:
• 1.25 FAR to replace the basic .5 - .75 FAR in many neighborhoods, in some cases allowing for 6
stories in vintage communities. 6 stories on a traditionally 4-story street is not as detrimental
as 4-6 stories on a one ½ story street. This is why 5 distinct districts are so important. There are
differences! The new construction is aimed at transient millennial professionals making
$100,000 and not families looking to stay.
• It would encourage “formula-based” setbacks shrinking space between buildings on smaller
irregular (500 ft) subdivisions AS-OF-RIGHT with no DESIGN REVIEW OR ABUTTER RECOURSE.
• There is no accommodation for affordable housing or pathways to homeownership in the
petition.
• Single-family housing in Cambridge is relatively low at 8.8% and much of that is in a historic
district. Even New York City has 15%, Seattle has 81%.
• High-end jobs and housing are driving up land costs which drive out decent-paying, light
industrial jobs for people who are not college-educated.
• Competition for property between the AHO, 20% inclusionary and condo conversions does
nothing for middle income residents. It is not just units but the impact they have.
Nor is there any mention of historic Conservation districts, a target many proponents want to do away
with. Perhaps that is what the Crowe Petition, “amending Conservation District guidelines” is about- to
fix the AHO which recognized Cambridge History. The MMH certainly doesn’t. Proponents have cited
Harvard Street as the perfect example of mixed mid-rise, (historically based) multi-unit buildings. Those
bigger buildings have deeper setbacks and many of the stately houses have two- to 5 units per address.
This IS the middle income housing. Private owners set their own rents. Yet, this petition would

TO: The ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
RE: OPPOSING MISSING MIDDLE ZONING PETITION

b

THIS PETITION IGNORES WHAT IS CURRENTLY POSSIBLE.
1) Development of pre-existing non-conforming lots is already permissible. Residential structures are
being built on vacant lots, larger yards, parking lots. Additional units are permissible in basements and
attics, even in Conservation districts.
2) Older houses that are not deemed “preferably preserved” have been regularly replaced with designreviewed new multi-unit buildings.
3) Tearing down vintage buildings (which can be re-purposed) adds to landfill and the carbon footprint.
4) We have streamlined permitting and variances for particular larger projects.
5) This petition does NOT protect trees or open space which is also part of social equity and health.
Although that was “amended”, it is still a contradiction because mature trees have to be eliminated for a
bigger footprint. Just look at Jackson Park Housing.
6) Eliminating ALL PARKING creates HARDSHIPS AND STREET COMPETITION FOR SPACE. Working- and
middle-income people work in Woburn, Lowell, Nashua hunt for parking after returning home.

PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT ZONING:
•
•

We need multi-generational protection. A woman and her daughter were living in
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING when the mother died. The daughter had to vacate the unit.
A young family qualified for affordable housing until the parent exceeded the income level and
was evicted, making the choice to stay in poverty or lose housing.

This MISSING MIDDLE PETITION competes with other affordable housing zoning measures by raising
land costs. It is a gift to wealthy homeowners and developers and encourages house flipping.
Density may not result in greater racial equity- one of the proponents’ talking points. There is no public
transportation in certain parts of the city. As several proponents have stated at various meetings, the
most efficient action is to “tear down everything historical and build new”. That is pure ignorance.
Naturally occurring affordable housing are supplied by those very mid-size multi-family homes. If CHA is
$2 million short of losing a prime property, where is the CITY to subsidize and partner to secure more
PROPERTIES?
Quit depending on DEVELOPERS to do the CITY COUNCILORS’ JOB. A reminder, DEVELOPERS ARE NOT
URBAN PLANNERS AND WHACK-A-MOLE BUILDING WON’T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. Where is the city to
actually have meetings and take MMH points one at a time with everyone at the table? This is too
important to let a handful of private citizens enforce zoning rules on so many, much of it for their own
self-interest. PLEASE LET THIS SIMPLISTIC AND SHORT-SIGHTED “MISSING MIDDLE” PETITION EXPIRE.

Re: Missing Middle Rezoning Petition as Filed and as Amended

Dear Members of the Planning Board:
I serendipitously fell upon the newly minted amended petition on Friday, May 5, when
checking the date of the upcoming hearing. I note that such dramatic changes in the
petition, devoid of notice as statutorily required, deprives your residents of the due
process that is not just statutorily mandated, but arguably, given the breath of the
petition, constitutionally mandated.
For your convenience I provide statutory excerpts in support of this objection:
1. Relevant sections of MGL c. 40A, Sect. 5: Notice of the time and place of such public
hearing, of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, and of the place where texts and
maps thereof may be inspected shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in
the city or town once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication to be not less
than fourteen days before the day of said hearing, and by posting such notice in a
conspicuous place in the city or town hall for a period of not less than fourteen days before
the day of said hearing. Notice of said hearing shall also be sent by mail, postage prepaid to
the department of housing and community development, the regional planning agency, if
any, and to the planning board of each abutting city and town. The department of housing
and community development, the regional planning agency, the planning boards of all
abutting cities and towns and nonresident property owners who may not have received
notice by mail as specified in this section may grant a waiver of notice or submit an affidavit
of actual notice to the city or town clerk prior to town meeting or city council action on a
proposed zoning ordinance, by-law or change thereto. Zoning ordinances or by-laws may
provide that a separate, conspicuous statement shall be included with property tax bills sent
to nonresident property owners, stating that notice of such hearings under this chapter shall
be sent by mail, postage prepaid, to any such owner who files an annual request for such
notice with the city or town clerk no later than January first, and pays a reasonable fee
established by such ordinance or by-law. In cases involving boundary, density or use
changes within a district, notice shall be sent to any such nonresident property owner who

c

has filed such a request with the city or town clerk and whose property lies in the district
where the change is sought. No defect in the form of any notice under this chapter shall
invalidate any zoning ordinances or by-laws unless such defect is found to be misleading.

To be sure, by its own admission and it its own words, Petitioner presents the
Amended Missing Middle as a collaborative effort and in its prefatory statement asserts
the amendment is both MAJOR and TECHNICAL. And truly I agree with Petitioner.
From a quick glance, the amendments are absolutely MAJOR and absolutely
TECHNICAL. Given the late filing on the eve of Mother’s Day Weekend and given that
CDD Staff Memo in response, filed on May 5, does not even address the Amended
Petition language, I submit no line-by-line critique and rely on the Notice requirement of
Sect 40A. I also note that MGL chap. 40A also mandates notice to abutting towns.
While I see posted to Planning Board documents, two newspaper ads for the original
Petition in Cambridge Chronicle and Cambridge Wickedlocal, I see no formal notice to
the abutting towns. Since this zoning petition in its original form and amended form has
a breath that touches every border of our City, I submit that abutting towns should be
formally noticed.
Aside from the formal adequacy of Notice, I submit that this purported Amendment is
not a mere editorial/clerical amendment. It goes to the heart and soul of the original
petition, and in fact no one who was formally noticed would even recognize it as the
same. The cases are clear on this point:
In the case at bar, however, even if the action in form amending Article 28 of
the warrant be treated as an attempted amendment of the zoning by-law, the
change thereby sought to be wrought was truly fundamental and could not be valid
in the absence of a hearing and report on the new proposal by the planning board.
The original article upon which the planning board held its hearing and which was
inserted in the warrant for the town meeting sought to repeal the zoning by-law in
its entirety. It was nomere perfecting amendment which was sought to be adopted
reducing the area requirements in two kinds of districts and transferring certain
land from one district to another. In brief, the identity of the original proposed
article was utterly changed. The substance of the amendment involved too great a
departure to be covered by the provisions of G.L.(Ter.Ed.) c. 40, § 27, as appearing
in St.1941, c. 320, under which, in certain circumstances, a ‘town meeting may
adopt, reject, or amend and adopt’ a proposed by-law. See Nelson v. Belmont, 274
Mass. 35, 174 N.E. 320. Furthermore, Article 28 in the warrant did not sufficiently
apprise the voters of the subject matter of the vote finally taken. It did not ‘indicate
with substantial certainty thenature of the business to be acted on. Haven v. Lowell,
5 Metc. 35;Wood v. Jewell, 130 Mass. 270; Matthews v. Westborough, 131 Mass. §
521.’ Coffin v.
Lawrence, 143 Mass. 110, 112, 9 N.E. 6, 8.Tuckerman v. Moynihan, 282
Mass. 562, 565, 185 N.E. 2. For these reasons, the amendment of the zoning by-law
voted at the adjourned meeting was invalid.

The judge rightly excluded evidence of informal advertisement in a local newspaper and of
announcement by sound truck of possible reconsideration of the zoning question at the adjourned
town meeting. Failure to comply with the pertinent statutes could not, of course, be cured in
these ways. For the same reason there was no error in excluding evidence of expenditures and
acts of the respondent Deutschmann and others in reliance upon the amendment as voted, which,
we hardly need to add, did not tend to show the existence of a nonconforming use covered by
G.L.(Ter.Ed.) c. 40, § 26, as appearing in St.1933, c. 269, § 1.
Fish v. Town of Canton, 322 Mass 219 (1948)

And also see:
It is a settled principle that warrants for town meetings are to be liberally
interpreted and are not to be construed with great strictness. It is sufficient if
intelligible notice of the subject to be considered is given. Substantial certainty as
to the nature of the business to be acted upon is all that is required. Grover v.
Pembroke, 11 Allen, 88;Coffin v. Lawrence, 143 Mass. 110, 112, 9 N. E. 6;
Commonwealth v. Wentworth, 145 Mass. 50, 52, 12

N. E. 845. That principle is not applicable to the case at bar. It cannot validate a vote
changing the dividing line between two districts established by a zoning by-law of which no
notice was given in the warrant for the town meeting. So to hold would be contrary to the clear
requirement of the governing statute. That statute demands an exact statement of a defined
proposed modification of a zoning by-law. Its provisions are not satisfied by a general and
unspecified reference to a possible modification not set forth in unmistakable terms.
Nelson v. Town of Belmont, 274 Mass. 35 (1931).

Last Planning Board Meeting I spoke to address the history of zoning in Cambridge.
I spoke as a 4th generation East Cambridge resident, the daughter and grand daughter
of neighborhood factory workers. While much has been promoted about redlining
rooted in Cambridge racism, and I readily admit East Cambridge was redlined, that
designation was based on the conditions in the neighborhood, surrounded by 9
slaughterhouses, an ink factory, glue factory, rubber factory. The first public health trial
in the country was brought by the residents of East Cambridge. The trial took place at
the State House. The case was Tyler v. Squire’s. You can read the transcript here, all
600 pages:

=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA3
To be sure, if I had been contacted by the Federal Government, I would have
categorized East Cambridge as a blighted area and a high risk for investment. There
were three major Squire’s fires. One in the 19th Century actually burned 20 acres of the
Squire’s complex. During my lifetime there were two major Squire’s fires and the last
fire burned 6 days and the fire could be seen in New Hampshire. We were an

extraordinarily industrialized area. To view our zoning through the specter of racism
does a great disservice to the City, our ancestors and our extraordinary history. I am
attaching here a fascinating newsclip on the extent of industrialization in East
Cambridge during its heyday. I know that others have written to you with links to the
recent presentation of Charles Sullivan on the history of zoning in Cambridge. I urge
you to stop and listen. I publicly thank Charles Sullivan and our Historic Commission
since no one wants to discuss the elephant in the room. We are not Biloxi; we are not
New Orleans. Our zoning was based on health and safety. Despite redlining of East
Cambridge, the population of immigrants, Irish, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, were able to
secure bank loans and purchased homes. Banks were free to ignore the Federal
Government redlining maps and surely they did.

Respectfully submitted,

To Whom This May Concern
City of Cambridge, MA Ordinance Committee
I write in opposition to the Missing Middle Housing Zoning plan (MMH) before the Ordinance
Committee.
The MMH plan sidesteps the core issue that should determine housing policy in the City of
Cambridge. That issue is economics. That issue is affordability. The MMH would accommodate
young professionals coming to the city to work for Google, Facebook and the bio-tech industry.
It would do nothing for teachers, health providers, construction trades people, restaurant workers
and artists.
The city would be well advised to require digital and bio-tech employers of scale to take
responsibility for developing housing for their present and future employees. They can afford to
play that role. Public policy assistance coming from the City of Cambridge, be that in relaxed
zoning changes or other kinds of subsidies, should not substitute for the investment wealthy
employers can make on their own.
I have been a renter in Cambridge since 1974, for 47 years. Cambridge is a city with 60% or
more of its citizens living in rental housing. MMH petitioners have very little, if anything, to
contribute to the circumstances facing renters. It is apparent that MMH would introduce huge
incentives to homeowners who rent units in their buildings to substitute the construction of highend permanent homes. Additionally, MMH would introduce the same incentives to the few
remaining multi-unit freestanding rental buildings to convert to condos. Renters would be worse
off under MMH.
The slogan being employed by MMH advocates of “more homes” begs the question. Homes for
whom? MMH would exacerbate the economic divides that already exist in the City of
Cambridge. It should not pass.
Sincerely,
Christopher Mackin
