September 16, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-40, regarding a request to explore the
possibility of hiring American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters to translate at City press
conference, and to explore the possibility of using an app, such as “Language Line Solutions” to
enable officers and other City personnel to communicate with the deaf community, Director of
Emergency Communications and 911 Christina Giacobbe reports the following:
There are available resources through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to request ASL
interpreter services for press conferences. Over the next year, the City will pilot the use of ASL
interpreters for all City press conferences. During the pilot, costs and ASL interpreter availability
will be tracked to assess future viability. It is important to keep in mind that securing an ASL
interpreter may be challenging during an immediate threat, and there may be times when the City
is not able to secure an interpreter due to lack of availability. In such instances, the City will
seek to provide additional messaging through social media and the Cambridge Alert Network.
The Commission on Persons with Disabilities will confer and coordinate with the Police
Department, Fire Department, Mayor’s Office and Public Information Office on the pilot
initiative.
When first responders are responding in the field, they are faced with many challenges.
Effective communication between the community and public safety officials is integral to the
safety and well-being of residents and visitors. Currently, there is limited availability of smart
devices that can be used or deployed to launch apps such as Language Line Solutions to connect
virtual interpreters in real time for public safety officials. We are continuing to explore smart
devices that can be more versatile than the current deployment of cruiser and apparatus laptops.
However, in the meantime we have begun deploying a new tool to help residents, drivers,
pedestrians and visitors who are Deaf or hard of hearing communicate better with public safety
officials. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
recently released a Visor card for a visual tool for Police Officers and the Deaf and hard of

Packet Pg. 42

1.8

hearing community. The Visor cards are designed for attachment to a vehicle's sun visor and can
be used by both the motorist and an officer, firefighter or EMS personnel to communicate more
effectively with one another through the use of graphics. For example, if an individual is pulled
over by the Cambridge Police Department, an individual who is Deaf or hard of hearing can use
this card for the purpose of immediate communication.
These Visor cards will provide an immediate tool that we believe will improve communication
between police officers and drivers who are Deaf or hard of hearing during an encounter that can
often be stressful as well as when interacting with the Fire Department and EMS personnel. The
Commission for Persons with Disabilities, Police, Fire and Emergency Communications
Department will be collaborating with other departments and organizations to ensure we are able
to make these cards available to community members. We have attached a copy of the
Visor/information cards as well as a wallet sized version that can be used by pedestrians and
public safety officials.
With the help of other departments and community organizations, we will ensure outreach and
public information efforts inform residents that this Visor tool is available. In addition, we will
explore other means to enhance communication with the deaf community such as:
•
•

•

•
•

Include additional opportunities for the deaf community to offer perspectives in planning,
testing, training in communication with public safety departments.
Ensure accurate reception of Voice over Relay Service (VORS), IP, and Captioned
Telephones calls and Text to 9-1-1 calls in the Emergency Communication Center
(ECC).
Conduct additional outreach to the deaf community in general, and form relationships
with community leaders to continue to enhance emergency services and fostering
relationships.
Promote further training in interacting with deaf individuals for public safety officials and
others.
Distribute materials that can help the deaf community interact with public safety officials
during emergencies.

There are additional resources and tools that are currently in use to support the Deaf community
in communicating with emergency services such as Text to 9-1-1, Cambridge Alert Network and
Smart911. Members and visitors of the community can contact emergency services by utilizing
Text to 9-1-1 or dialing 9-1-1. The current 9-1-1 system is currently equipped with the text
feature and is currently being utilized by the Emergency Communications Center (ECC). Text to
9-1-1 provides the disability community with another way to communicate with public safety
agencies and request emergency services. The Emergency Communications Department has
been working closely with the Fire and Police Department on outreach and education on this new
tool. The campaign has been focused on promoting responsible use of Text to 9-1-1. As always,
calling 9-1-1 is the quickest way to get emergency services. However, we want to assure
members of the Deaf and hard of hearing community that in the event they dial 9-1-1 and are not
able to communicate, the Call Taker will process the call as a silent call and Police will be
dispatched to assess and aid the caller immediately.

Members of the Deaf and hard of hearing community can also sign up for emergency
notifications through CodeRed. CodeRED is an emergency notification system that allows the
City to send emergency notifications to subscribers via email, text and phone calls. This service
is used in the event of emergencies affecting the City, such as snow emergencies, evacuations,
large-scale water outages or other significant service disruptions. We strongly encourage anyone
who lives, works, attends school, owns property or is otherwise interested in being informed
about emergencies connected to one or more Cambridge addresses to enroll online at
<https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/CambridgeAlertNetwork>. Once enrolled, residents
are encouraged to set up an account so that it can be self- managed. Because of this, it is vitally
important that members of the community use CodeRED online subscription page to add their
home phone (land line), cell phone numbers which receive text message notifications, email
addresses, and VoIP-type phone numbers.
An additional tool to benefit members of the Deaf and hard of hearing community is Smart911.
Smart911 is an application that allows residents, workers, and visitors of Cambridge the
opportunity to create a Smart911 Safety Profile that helps 9-1-1 call takers and first responders
make faster and better decisions about care needed, increase response times, and save lives by
having specific information related to the caller. By creating a free Smart911 Safety Profile at
<http://www.Smart911.com> or on the Smart911 mobile app
<https://www.ravemobilesafety.com/rave-911-suite>, first responders will have access to
information such as medical conditions, disabilities/impairment, lists of medications, phone
numbers, home and work addresses, family member information, photos and pet information can
be included as well in the profile. The Smart911 profile provides additional data to the
Emergency Telecommunications Dispatcher (ETD) which allows for a faster, more effective
response as the safety profile comes in to the ECC when the registered caller dials 911. When
members of the Deaf and hard of hearing community need to contact emergency services, this
critical patient information allows first responders to prepare for treatment of the patient prior to
arriving on scene and assessing the condition. This results in better clinical care to our residents
as well as responding to any emergency of the caller.
Lastly, the Emergency Communications Department made a presentation to the Cambridge
Commission for Persons with Disabilities on May 9, 2019. The presentation focused on Text to
9-1-1, Smart911 and other resources that are available to the community for communicating with
public safety departments. In addition, we agreed to meet with the Commission annually or
more frequent as needed to discuss improvements in communication and/or outreach efforts to
engage with the disability community.

Awaiting Report 19-95 – Idling Vehicles

Dear Sir:
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report 19-93, whereby it was requested that
the Cambridge Police Department report on whether idling vehicles may be added as
a complaint category in SeeClickFix, or whether a non-emergency text hotline could be set up to
transmit photographic or video evidence of truck idling and blocked bike lanes to the Police
Department to help enforce the idling laws.
Adding Idling Vehicles as a complaint category in SeeClickFix
Through discussions with the City’s 311 Project Manager, Dan Riviello, it should be noted that
SeeClickFix (Commonwealth Connect) currently allows residents to report into a variety of categories
that are assigned to City staff to address.
One such category, “Bike Lane Obstruction,” is assigned to the Police Department for follow up and is
used as a way for police to collect data on problem locations that may benefit from additional
enforcement or possible changes to road design. It is not intended to be a real-time mechanism for
generating a police response.
This category, as with all categories, should not be used to elicit an immediate response from City staff.
When using the system (either online or via a smartphone app), residents are shown a message stating,
“…For public safety issues or issues that require immediate attention (such as hanging wires, double
parked cars, sick/injured animals, etc.) please call 617-349-3300 to report as this system is not monitored
24/7 and you should not expect an immediate response” before they submit their report. This is to
encourage direct reporting to the non-emergency number as it is the preferred method for requesting a
timely response.

While Massachusetts General Law Part I, Title XIV, Chapter 90C, Section 3 indicates “If a police
officer observes or has brought to the officer's attention the occurrence of a civil motor vehicle
infraction, the officer may issue a written warning or may cite the violator for a civil motor vehicle
infraction…” the Cambridge Police Department requests residents who witness a possible motor
vehicle violation (e.g. idling, bicycle lane obstruction, etc.) to record the license plate number, pull

A reported violation not witnessed by an officer can easily lead to issues associated with the veracity
of the photo or video evidence in court. For the citation to be upheld, it is required to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the person in a vehicle is the same person who committed the documented
violation. Additionally, documenting pictures or videos while traveling in a vehicle or bicycle is
illegal, unsafe and could potentially lead to a confrontation with the documented party. Reporting
violations to the Cambridge Police removes potential safety issues that follow attempts at a resident’s
own policing. An officer may follow-up with the reporting party and request any evidence associated
with a violation as part of its investigation.
SeeClickFix reports alone should not be the basis for issuing a citation, and since we do not want to
encourage residents to use SeeClickFix to report issues requiring immediate attention, we do not believe
creating an “Idling Vehicles” category in SeeClickFix would be prudent.
Vehicles that may idle for “necessary” or “unavoidable” purposes
MGL Ch. 90 sec. 16A does provide exemptions but does not provide a specific list. It would be
reasonable to include the following:
• Police, Fire, EMS and other government vehicles that utilize emergency lights, radios
for communication, or have computers to access applications such as dispatch screens, RMV
databases etc.
• Armored cars actively delivering or picking up
• Delivery vehicles that utilize engine powered accessories such as refrigeration, lifts, hydraulic
functions, etc.
• Wheelchair lift equipped vehicles including private vans, chair car service, and buses
• Medically necessary for heating or cooling
• Necessary to clear windows of ice and snow to ensure safe operation
It may not be immediately apparent that an idling vehicle is engaged in “necessary” or “unavoidable”
idling. This is another reason why citations based on online reports alone would not be advisable.
Massachusetts General Law chapter 90, section 16B pertains specifically to vehicles on school
grounds. Section 16B prohibits all unnecessary idling of motor vehicles within one hundred feet of
a “public or private accredited preschool, accredited Head Start facility, elementary, vocational or
secondary school whether or not in session, and shall include any athletic field or facility and any
playground used for school purposes or functions which are owned by a municipality or school
district, regardless of proximity to a school building, as well as any parking lot appurtenant to such
school, athletic field, facility or playground.”
Since 2016, the Cambridge Police Department has received 403 calls for service for idling vehicles.
14 citations have been issued during the same time period.

In response to the above referenced awaiting report please be advised that Public Works staff
inspects all of the parks mentioned in the order on a daily basis. Specific to Greene-Rose
Heritage Park, this park is maintained by both in-house employees and contracted services. On
a weekly basis in-house crews sweep hard surfaces, pickup litter, and mow all the grass areas.
Every other week planting beds are pruned weeded and litter is removed utilizing one of our
park contractors.
Over the last several weeks Public Works has been supplementing litter sweeps at Green Rose
Heritage Park. These operations include litter pick-ups on a daily basis and such will continue
throughout the Autumn until the park is given a full fall cleanup. We will re-evaluate
operations at this location over the winter and make adjustments to schedules next Spring where
necessary.
For the other parks mentioned (Clement
Morgan, Anthony Paolillo, and Sennott),
the majority of the maintenance at these
parks is being done through contract
services. Supervisors have had
discussions with our contractors to
insure they are diligently adhering to
contract specifications. In-house crews
have also been deployed to do additional
sweeps and cleanups of each of these
parks. These locations will also be
monitored through the remainder of the
fall season to assure that they are kept in
a clean and safe condition, and we will
also re-evaluate the need for any
additional services in these locations for
next spring.

September 16, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report 19-56, regarding a report on the feasibility of constructing a
quick-build complete streets project to provide separated bike lanes on Massachusetts Avenue in
Central Square, from Sidney Street to Putnam Avenue, Director of Traffic, Parking, and
Transportation Joseph Barr, Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq,
and Commissioner of Public Works Owen O’Riordan report the following.
In analyzing this request, it is important to look at both the process that is used to determine
priorities for the implementation of complete streets improvements (including separated bicycle
lanes), as well as to look at this corridor in multiple segments based on the complexity of street
and land use. Within the overall segment identified in this request, we would divide the corridor
into two sub-segments:
•

•

The segment from Putnam Avenue to Bigelow Street, which is narrower, has a different
density and mix of land uses, and does not currently have marked bicycle facilities (other
than a couple of blocks near Bigelow Street).
The segment from Bigelow Street to Sidney Street, which travels through the heart of
Central Square and is wider, has a higher density and range of land uses, is host to a Red
Line Station and several high usage bus stops, and currently has conventional on-street
bicycle lanes.

It is also important to note that the continued success of Central Square as a vibrant and livable
community hub for business, culture, and government relies on a delicate balance of different
activities that go beyond transportation. Any planning related to complete streets and
reconfiguring Central Square for the benefit of street users of all ages and abilities must take into
account a broad range of factors and stakeholders, to avoid taking any actions that would change
that balance in a negative way. We want to ensure that as we contemplate changes that serve our
City goals related to promoting sustainable transportation and improving access to community

Packet Pg. 53

1.12

resources and economic opportunities, we do not inadvertently make it more difficult to achieve
other goals that we have related to Central Square.
Separated Bicycle Lane Prioritization Process
One of the key elements of any new vision for Central Square is likely to be the introduction of
separated bicycle lanes, based both on current safety outcomes and feedback we have already
received from the community. The 2015 Cambridge Bicycle Plan created a Network Vision that
identified streets where greater separation of bicycle travel from motor vehicle travel was a
priority. Implementation of those improvements can occur in a few possible ways:
• As part of street reconstruction that occurs through the Five Year Sidewalk and Street
Reconstruction Plan. Since the passage of the Cycling Safety Ordinance, the City is
required to implement separated bicycle lanes when streets in the Five Year Plan have
also been identified in the Network Vision, subject to the exceptions noted in the
Ordinance.
• As part of street reconstruction that occurs due to private development or is completed by
state agencies on their facilities.
• As quick build projects, for streets that are not part of any of the processes noted above.
Because the 2015 Plan did not identify specific time lines for projects, the 2020 Update to the
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (currently underway) includes tasks to complete planning level
feasibility analyses for streets that were identified for separated bicycle lanes, as well as to
develop a clear prioritization process that enables the public to provide input on its priorities and
for the City to establish a rational framework and timeline for implementation of separated
bicycle lane projects (particularly those that are potential quick-build projects).
Public input on concerns and priorities is underway, and feasibility analysis of the various
corridors has also begun. This fall, we expect to start identifying projects that could be
implemented over the next couple of years. Given that Massachusetts Avenue is a primary travel
corridor, we expect to be look at the feasibility for all segments along it (including the two noted
above) and identify priorities for implementation. We would also emphasize that any projects
resulting from the plan update will need to include a robust community engagement process as
part of the planning and implementation process.
Next Steps by Segment
We have identified the following next steps for moving forward with separated bicycle lane
planning and implementation along this corridor.
•

•

As part of the Market Central development project (formerly known as Mass + Main), a
grade-separated cycle track is being constructed on the westbound side of Massachusetts
Avenue between Sidney Street and Douglass Street, to replace the pop-up separated
bicycle lane that was installed in late 2016. This facility is expected to open in mid-2020.
The segment of Massachusetts Avenue between Bigelow Street and Putnam Avenue will
be included in the feasibility analysis and prioritization for a quick-build project through
the 2020 Bicycle Plan Update, as discussed above. We will prioritize early feasibility
evaluation of this segment, building on some initial planning work that was started in
Packet Pg. 54

1.12

•

2017. Although the feasibility analysis will consider the design and impacts in greater
detail, it is likely that a separated bicycle lane in this segment will require the removal of
a significant number of parking spaces.
Massachusetts Avenue between Sidney Street and Bigelow Street is now included in the
City’s Five Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan, which will allow the City to
create a design that incorporates improved bicycle facilities, along with additional
transportation enhancements to improve safety and accessibility for all users of the
square, particularly those who use sustainable transportation. This reconstruction project
will include a significant community engagement effort that takes into account views
from a wide range of stakeholders and street users, including residents, transit users and
operators, businesses (including the recently-formed Central Square Business
Improvement District), and non-profits.

The City very clearly recognizes the need for significant bicycle safety improvements in this
corridor, but we also believe that it is important to do this within the context of ongoing planning
and design efforts that consider the comprehensive range of users and uses, so that we can create
the safest and most beneficial improvements. We look forward to continuing to work with the
City Council, residents, businesses, advocacy organizations, and other stakeholders to continue
implementation of our separated bicycle lane network.

Awaiting Report 19-55 – Feasibility of Creating a Play Streets
Permit

This memo is in response to Order 6 from the May 6, 2019 City Council
Meeting (Awaiting Report 19-55) requesting that the City evaluate the feasibility
of a Play Streets program similar to programs that exist in Seattle and other
communities.
As noted in the original Policy Order, a Play Streets program is distinct from a
block party in that they typically occur on a more regular basis and do not
require individual approvals for each closure, but rather establish a process for
closing streets to non-local access on a recurring schedule. This creates the
opportunity for simple recreational and community-building activities by making
streets space available for purposes other than the movement and storage of
vehicles. During the times when streets are being used as Play Streets, they
typically remain open to local residents/abutters, and provisions are always
made for ensuring emergency vehicle access.
More specific information about Play Streets programs in Seattle and San
Francisco programs is available here:
Seattle: http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-andprograms/programs/public-space-management-programs/play-streets
San Francisco: https://sfplaystreets.org
After consulting with License Commission Chair Nicole Murati-Ferrer and
learning more about the play streets programs in other communities (notably
Seattle and San Francisco), both the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation
Department and the License Commission believe that such a program is
feasible. We would recommend moving forward with a pilot version of such a
program, so that we can better determine the level of interest, the logistical
requirements, and the operational impacts, before we determine whether such
a program should be expanded. The License Commission would not need to

How frequently would we generally allow a street to be closed as a Play
Street?
What are the resources (staff, materials, and funding) required to
operate such a program?
How often would a Play Streets permit need to be reviewed and reapproved?
Would the establishment of a Play Street require that parking be
restricted on that segment of street, or can parked cars remain on the
street?
How well used is the pilot location and are there any overall lessons
learned from the pilot?
What is the overall response from local residents and are there any
unintended consequences or unexpected impacts?
How to Play Streets permits (and the associated activities) relate to the
existing Block Party program?
How do we handle issues such as outreach/notification,
rubbish/recycling, and controlling access to the street for local residents
and emergency vehicles.
How do we ensure that Play Streets locations are located in a way that
is equitable to different neighborhoods and groups?
What types of community partners are available to help organize and
support Play Streets?
How do we ensure that there are meaningful recreational and
community activities happening during a Play Street, such that the street
closure truly benefits the local community?
What fees should be associated with a Play Street permit?

It is worth noting that although some communities make it free to apply for a
Play Streets permit, operating a Play Street does require resources from local
partners, in terms of both materials and staffing. For example, San Francisco
has established six specific “Captain Roles” that must be filled for each Play
Street (requiring at least three different people to be involved), while Seattle
requires that an adult monitor be located at the closure location to move the
barricades to allow local access.

In response to the above-mentioned Awaiting Report 19-77, we submit the
following. Harvard Square is an important and central destination for bicycles
in Cambridge. As such, there are on-going efforts to add bicycle parking
around the Square as opportunities arise. As part of the Smith Center
renovation, fifty bicycle racks with capacity for one hundred bicycles, were
installed on the three surrounding sidewalks on Holyoke, Mt. Auburn and
Dunster Streets.
Currently, work on the Smith Center is continuing with roof replacement, and
project scaffolding is covering some of the bicycle parking, making almost half
of the bike parking spots unusable. Work on the building is expected to be
completed in October 2019. Once the work is complete, the scaffolding is
removed, and all of the installed bicycle parking becomes available, a survey of
bicycle parking use will be conducted. We have identified potential locations
around the project where additional racks may be installed. If a need for
additional bicycle parking is identified by the survey, City staff will work with
Harvard University and the Harvard Square Business Association to review final
locations for installation of bike racks in suitable, publicly accessible space.

In response to the above-mentioned Awaiting Report, we submit the following.
The Net Zero Action Plan (NZAP), adopted by the City in 2015, proposed that the
whole suite of recommendations be reviewed every five years throughout
implementation. These reviews are intended to allow for the overall strategy to be
adjusted based on changing economics, technology and stakeholder needs. The
review process is expected to be supported by staff and be informed by a group of
diverse stakeholders.
The Community Development Department will initiate the first of these reviews in
FY20. The review process will:
1. Evaluate the impact of the Net Zero Action Plan to date, based on existing
data sources and projections regarding NZAP targets and impacts. Establish
a methodology for ongoing NZAP progress assessment.
2. Review the current context of GHG reductions from buildings in Cambridge
including the science of climate change and Cambridge’s climate change
commitments; relevant climate policies at the local, regional, state, and
federal level; and technological and economic feasibility of net zero
construction.
3. Recommend adjustments to the Net Zero Action Plan, if needed, to align
the observed and projected Plan impact with the results needed to achieve
Cambridge’s climate change commitments, considering both GHG
reductions and estimated impacts of proposed changes.
4. Develop a plan including timelines, resources, and stakeholder roles for
implementation of the recommendations, including an assessment of the
social equity impacts and opportunities associated with the plan.

New Street Overlay District Zoning Petition

On July 30, 2019, the City Council accepted the report of the Ordinance
Committee on the New Street Overlay District Zoning Petition (the “Petition”)
and adopted a policy order to instruct the Community Development Department
revise the language in the Petition and to include specific changes in the revision.
The attached zoning text incorporates the amendments recorded in the Ordinance
Committee Report as well as some minor clarifying text edits to improve the
language. In addition, this memo highlights some issues noted by staff that should
be considered if the Council moves to ordain the Petition. Also attached to this
memo, as requested by a member of the Ordinance Committee, is a chart
summarizing the changes to development potential that would result on the two
affected lots if the Petition is adopted.
Developer Commitments
The Petition was submitted by Self Storage Group, LLC (the “Petitioner”) for the
purpose of establishing an overlay district, to be known as the New Street Overlay
District, that would apply to an area along the eastern side of New Street currently
zoned as Industrial A-1. The Petition would allow the development of a selfstorage facility and would relax the dimensional requirements in the base zone for
such a facility. The Petition would also add “self-storage facility” as a use in the
Zoning Ordinance’s Table of Uses, set forth in Article 4.000, Section 4.31.

Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

In presentations to the Ordinance Committee, the Petitioner outlined a set of
public benefits that if proposed would be associated with the proposed
development of a self-storage facility, including development of affordable
housing units, storage space for low-income families and for recreational
organizations, maintaining a fitness center on the site, development of a “Net Zero
Energy” building and solar array, creation of a new bike/pedestrian path,
stormwater flooding mitigation, and the contribution of approximately $2 million
in incentive zoning payments (the latter two benefits would be provided for any
project of this type under current zoning requirements). However, the Petitioner
has not provided a letter of commitment setting forth its proposed commitments
that it would make to the City in connection with the proposed zoning and
committing to any such proposed public benefits.

Packet Pg. 67

Attachment: New St Overlay Zoning Memo 09-16-19 (CMA 2019 #251 : proposed amendments to the New Street Overlay District Zoning Petition)

1.17.a

Legal Analysis
In cases where a property owner is petitioning to change the zoning of their
parcel, it is important for the property owner to affirmatively commit to providing
specific benefits through a letter of commitment that is accepted by the City
Council and incorporated in and made part of the Zoning Ordinance by reference
(a “Letter of Commitment”). This is important in order to avoid such proposed
zoning targeted only to specific parcels from being impermissible spot zoning (or
reverse spot zoning, as the case may be), and possibly subject to challenge as an
exaction of a property interest. The proposed zoning amendment text itself should
not require direct benefits from the owner but should rather set forth clear
standards for development and, in this case, the specific criteria for granting a
special permit.
One important matter that would need to be specified in a Letter of Commitment
is the property owner’s commitment to producing affordable housing units. The
Petition would allow an increase in density and height for a self-storage facility
with one of the criteria for approval being the inclusion of 20,000 square feet of
affordable housing (according to the latest amendments forwarded to the full City
Council by the Ordinance Committee). However, the latest materials from the
Petitioner suggest that not all of the affordable housing would be funded by the
developer, and some would be proposed to be developed with public funding,
which would be requested from the Affordable Housing Trust and other public
sources. The materials note that the Petitioner will commit to funding the creation
of 15 units of affordable housing, or approximately 15,000 square feet, and
therefore it would appear that the additional development potential provided in
the Petition would only be possible if public funding is committed to fund the
remaining portion of the required 20,000 square feet. The specifics of this
arrangement are not entirely clear and should be set forth in detail in a Letter of
Commitment from the Petitioner before any final action is taken.
Another concern with this Petition as it relates to public benefits is that it affects a
parcel that is not controlled by the Petitioner. If a Letter of Commitment is
accepted and made part of the Zoning Ordinance, it is unclear how the Petitioner
would honor those commitments, as they would apply to the other affected
property owner who does not appear to be a party to the agreement between the
Petitioner and the City that is being proposed by the Petitioner.
Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the proposed public benefits should be set
forth in a Letter of Commitment and not the zoning amendment text itself and I
have concerns about the City accepting a Letter of Commitment that would apply
to another affected property owner who is not a party to the agreement. Requiring

1.17.a

public benefits in the text of the zoning amendment or in a Letter of Commitment
that a property owner has not agreed to could both be subject to challenge.
Clarity of Requirements
When the Planning Board discussed this Petition, one of the issues noted was that
the language setting forth requirements and criteria for granting a special permit is
not very clear. An example is that it references “lots that are greater than 300 feet
in depth, but do not have street frontage in excess of 150 feet” but the text does
not specify if that is a required qualification for granting of a special permit. The
other special permit criteria that are enumerated are very broad, which would
make it difficult for the Planning Board to evaluate whether or not they are met.
The Planning Board did not suggest improvements because it made an
unfavorable recommendation on the proposal in general. If the City Council
adopts the Petition, the next step would be for the Planning Board to evaluate a
development proposal for conformance with the special permit criteria, and
therefore it would be beneficial for the Council to articulate its development
expectations in the form of specific criteria for the Planning Board to apply. Staff
are available to assist with drafting appropriate language if the Council reaches
consensus on the substance of the criteria that should be included.
Use Categories
The Petition proposes changes to Articles 4.000 and 6.000 of the Zoning
Ordinance that could have impacts beyond this particular development proposal.
After conferring with the Inspectional Services Department, it is apparent that a
“self-storage facility” as it has been described would be allowed in Industry
districts under current zoning as a “Storage warehouse, cold storage plant, storage
building, but not including storage or bailing of junk, scrap metal, rags, waste
paper or used rubber” (Paragraph 4.37 k.). Accordingly, it is not necessary to add
“self-storage facility” to Articles 4.000 and 6.000 because a self-storage facility
use is already allowed under the Zoning Ordinance. Additionally, if the Council
wishes to add “self-storage facility” as a separate use in Articles 4.000 and 6.000
the Petition does not provide a definition for “self-storage facility,” so it may be
ambiguous whether a particular building would be considered a “self-storage
facility” or a more general “storage building.” A specific, narrow definition of a
“self-storage facility” would help to make that distinction. Also, as noted in a
prior CDD memo, the Petition does not specify bicycle parking or loading
requirements for that use, which may also create ambiguity if self-storage
facilities are established in the City in the future.

be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.900. It is the intent
of this section that these regulations will apply to that area along the eastern side of New Street
currently zoned as Industrial A-1.
20.92 Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.900 to augment base zoning regulations in the
District in order to enhance the development of low traffic generating uses that support the
multi-family dwellings in the adjoining Alewife Overlay District and surrounding Residential
Districts, encourage affordable and market rate housing production, and accomplish the City's
climate mitigation and adaptation goals.
20.93 Applicability. The New Street Overlay District shall be an overlay district on the zoning map
established by Section 3.20.
20.93.1 The building and land uses within the New Street Overlay District shall be regulated by the
provisions of the applicable base zoning district except as modified by the requirements of this
section 20.900, which shall apply in addition to regulations imposed by the base zoning district
designations. Where the base zoning regulations for non non-residential uses differ from the
requirements of this Section 20.900, the stricter provisions shall apply, unless a Special Permit is
issued by the Planning Board pursuant to Article this Section 20.900.
20.94 Dimensional Standards in the New Street Overlay District
20.94.1 Maximum Height. The maximum height of any non non-residential structure in the Overlay
District shall be that permitted in the applicable base zoning district, provided however the
building height for a self self-storage facility (Section 4.37.n) may be increased to sixty-five (65’)
feet upon issuance of a Special Permit by the Planning Board, provided however that portions of
buildings exceeding fifty-five (55) feet in height shall be set back behind forty-five (45) degree

20.94.2 Minimum Required Setbacks. The minimum required front yard setback for any structure in the
Overlay District shall be that permitted in the Industry A-1 District.
20.95 Special Gross Floor Area Provisions. The Floor Area Ratio for a self self-storage facility (Section
4.37.n) may be increased to 3.0 of the lot area by issuance of a Special Permit from the Planning
Board. The additional floor area is intended to allow for the construction of a commercially
viable self self-storage facility on lots that are greater than 300 feet in depth, but do not have
street frontage in excess of 150 feet.
20.95.1 Criteria for Granting Special Permit. In granting the Special Permit for increases in Gross Floor
Area and height for a self self-storage facility pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall
find that the additional GFA proposed can be reasonably accommodated on the site without
generating significant traffic that will have an adverse effect on surrounding uses. In addition to
the foregoing, the Planning Board shall find that such development has met all of the following
criteria in addition to the other criteria specified in Section 10.43:
1.

The development contains at least 8,000 sf twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of
gGross fFloor aArea devoted to affordable housing which shall comply with and be
subject to the provisions of the Standards for Eligibility, Rent, Initial Sale Price, and
Parking Fees for Affordable Dwelling Units Created through lnclusionary Housing
provisions of Article 11.200 set forth in Section 11.203.4 of this Zoning Ordinance. The

2019 at 12:06 PM in the Sullivan Chamber to continue discussions on proposed amendments to the
Affordable Housing Overlay District petition. He announced that there will be no public comment. He
announced that the hearing was being televised.
Present were: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor
Simmons, Councillor Siddiqui, Mayor McGovern, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Zondervan,
Councillor Toomey, Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer, CDD, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, Chris
Cotter, Director of Housing, CDD, Jeff Roberts, Senior Manager of Zoning and Development,
CDD, Cassie Arnaud, Housing Planning, CDD, City Clerk Anthony Wilson, Will Durbin, Chief of
Staff for Mayor McGovern and Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk’s Office.
Also present were Elaine DeRosa, 4 Pleasant Place, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, Skip Schloming,
102R Inman Street, Young Kim, 17 Norris Street, James Zall, 203 Pemberton Street, Elizabeth Gombosi,
42 Irving street, Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street, Carol O’Hare, 172 Magazine Street, Lynn Cetnito, 46
Grozier Road, Douglass Payne, 24 Sherman Street and John Pitkin 18 Fayette Street.
Councillor Carlone outlined the format of the meeting. He noted that the City is the petitioner and there
are handouts distributed by Community Development Department including an Affordable Housing
Zoning proposal, comparison charts dated August 29, 2019 (ATTACHMENT 46), a memo from
Community Development dated August 29, 2019, additions to the Affordable Housing Overlay petition
are highlighted in blue and Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Draft dated August
29, 2019. He stated that is also a handout compiled by the Mayor’s Office as of September 3, 2019 with
the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay and this will be used as a guide (ATTACHMENT
47). There is also a handout that outlines which amendments are on hold, pending language from City
Solicitor and the items that were referred to Community Development Department (ATTACHMENT
48).
Mr. Roberts gave an overview of the material submitted to the Ordinance Committee by e-mail last
Thursday. The main document is a revised version of the zoning text (ATTACHMENT 49). There were
Packet Pg. 74

2.1

changes to the proposal that were voted on by the Ordinance Committee and they have been incorporated
into the zoning text and made some clarifying changes based on comments by the Planning Board that
needed clarification. He spoke about clarifying edits which have also been incorporated into the revised
text and includes commentary on the right side to be able to identify the substantive changes. He stated
that there is a memo on CDD letter head transmitting supplemental information on questions that were
asked at the previous Ordinance Committee hearings (ATTACHMENT 50). This memo includes
commentary information relating to Net Zero Ready Buildings, Displacement/Relocation Assistance,
Transportation Demand Management Requirements, Density Limits/FAR Caps, Applicability and Import
of the Tree Ordinance and Historic Preservation and greater clarification about language in the zoning
related to the State Register of Historic Places. He stated that another document was an updated
comparison charts and maps that illustrate the provision of the Affordable Housing Overlay compared to
the base zoning limitations across the base zoning districts in the zoning ordinance (ATTACHMENT
51). He noted that this was presented with the original proposal and this has been updated based on the
recent set of changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. He stated that there is an updated set of Design
Guidelines incorporating comments made by the Ordinance Committee (ATTACHMENT 52). Mr.
Thorkildsen will provide a summary of the changes.
Councillor Carlone asked if the key points be reviewed by the staff in the presentation. Mr. Roberts
stated that he will go through the substantive changes to the zoning text. Councillor Carlone noted that
the FAR is different. Mr. Roberts stated that in response to a change to FAR staff looked at. He stated
that there was a report that went to the City Council that was prepared with assistance from the Assessing
Department. The basis for AHO proposal is the notation for site to be acquired and for the ability to do
affordable housing developments in a way where sites could be feasible acquired and develop would
require greater density in order to spread the acquisition costs for sites over a greater number of units.
The conclusion depending on the site and acquisition costs of site there could a lot of variation but as an
approximate mid-point in lower density residential districts an affordable housing project would need to
have a FAR of 2 in order to come up with a feasible acquisition per unit. He stated that a FAR of 2 was
seen in those districts as a reasonable limitation that would allow affordable housing developments to be
feasible on sites in the lower density areas. He stated that as the analysis that was done shows that there
are some sites that this would not be feasible and some it would be depending on the character and nature
of the site. This was seen to be a reasonable limitation on density.
Mr. Cotter stated that there were several amendments that introduced the idea of FAR and the City
Council asked CDD staff to review this and come back with comments as to what would be an
appropriate FAR. He stated that building from the analysis recently done with the Assessors and the
market to see what level of density might be needed in order to make more sites possible for affordable
housing development. He stated that he feels comfortable with the FAR of 2.0 even before discussing the
form-based approach that was discussed is deriving from a FAR of 2.0. He stated that with the interest in
having a cap on density in the neighbor districts this was taken as a good reason to bring up the 2.0 again.
This has been put into the petition and was noted in the memo. Councillor Carlone commented that the
non-applicable on the higher density zones means that there is no change in the high-density zones. Mr.
Cotter responded in the affirmative and stated that there is no cap on FAR that would apply in the
neighborhood districts where the FAR is under 1 there would be a cap set at 2. There is no theorical cap
in the corridors or the areas expected to see development, but there is a cap based on the size of the
building envisioned based on the number of stories and height. Councillor Carlone asked if the lower
density districts being affected and was there any studies done on A2, B, C and C1. Mr. Roberts stated
that site study models were previously presented; there were several site development alternatives that
modeled a building outcome that would be at a FAR of 2. He explained that when the models were done,
they were not shown in specific locations. It was decided that it was preferable to show more generic
context rather than picking specific sites. The examples are shown in a context with a range of different
buildings that may be typical in Res. A, B, or C or lower density districts. There were 2 alternatives
shown. One alternative had more units and less parking with a FAR of 2.4. This would exceed the
limitation. The second alternative, referred to as Site 3 Alternative B, shows parking on the site with a
FAR of 2. Councillor Carlone asked that the alternatives be resubmitted and reworded and that it
be based on the submission of today.

Mr. Thorkildsen provided a summary of the changes to the Design Guidelines. The change is in the way
that the Guidelines are presented, and the language was simplified. The introduction was revised. The
text was cleaned up and included principals and objectives and included Historical Guidelines and
included illustrations. Councillor Carlone commented that these are still suggestions. Mr. Thorkildsen
stated that these are recommended guidelines and not directives.
City Solicitor Glowa commented on the definitions of abutters and public way. Ms. Glowa stated that the
abutter language is included in the revised text. She stated that on page 23 language has been
incorporated from the zoning ordinance and Chapter 40A regarding notice and to whom notice is sent.
She stated that she is unclear on what she was to provide committee and welcomes further guidance to
provide the information. She stated that received a document that refers to 36A amendment and does not
appear to be related to public ways. Councillor Carlone noted that there was some concern about how the
public way is defined. He noted that there is an amendment to 36A which adds “and the public way.”
City Clerk Wilson referred to section 7.6 in the ordinance there are four subsections and there is a
proposal to amend subsection (d) that reads New outdoor light fixtures installed in an AHO project shall
be fully shielded and directed to prevent light trespass onto adjacent residential lots and the public way.
He noted that a question at the last Ordinance Committee hearing was how to appropriately define public
way. Councillor Carlone stated that there was not a definitive definition on public way and
informed the City Solicitor that she could get back to the Ordinance Committee on this. City
Solicitor Glowa stated that it is unclear what guidance is sought. She stated that there is some light on
public ways, and it is not clear whether the committee is looking for language that would keep all light
from being shed onto any public way. She stated that she could provide suggested language at the next
meeting. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that in the revised Design Guidelines there is now a reference to
following some of the suggestion in the Outdoor Lighting Ordinance which was never adopted. She
stated that the example that she used was the light at the Tobin School that was not shielded and was
intended to be a security light for the school which went well beyond the school grounds and blinded
pedestrians who were passing. This was a precaution to acknowledge that lighting that is on a property
can spill out into the public way and not be pleasant to pedestrians and not provide security. She did not
know how to put this into zoning language. City Solicitor Glowa wanted to figure out how best to
address this issue. Councillor Carlone stated that this maybe shielded from the public but letting some
indirect light go forward. This is about is glare that the Vice Mayor is referring to. City Solicitor Glowa
stated that there is a difference between being shielded and not shedding any light. She stated that there
are other places in the zoning ordinance that talks about shielding from direct light trespass onto
neighboring properties. She stated that she would work on a proposal that is more refined to get to what
the committee is getting at.
Councillor Carlone proceeded to the amendments that were placed on hold.
Amendment # 1. Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to remove striking out the word
“limited.” He stated the question is, is 4 times the increase in zoning worthy of the word limited being
removed. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the word limited in this sentence refers to height. This is
limited increases in height. She noted that a previous amendment she offered was to add the word
incremental. She noted that the increases in height are somewhat limited. On an affirmative vote of 9
members the amendment carried. City Solicitor noted that the word “incremental” was adopted by the
Ordinance Committee on August 8th. Councillor Carlone noted that the word “incremental” was
approved on Amendment # 5. Councillor Carlone Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment
to add after the word “allow” the word “incremental” and leave in the word limited. On an
affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment carried.
Amendment # 2. Councillor Carlone noted that this was an amendment by Councillor Zondervan to
include in the Affordable Housing Overlay Eligible Households by adding at the end the words “or a
household that was living in a building that is built or refurbished under the AHO.”

Packet Pg. 76

2.1

Councillor Simmons stated that she finds this restrictive and will not support it. She noted that this
throws off the AMI configurations. She stated that this is more troublesome and requested that it be
removed.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked Councillor Zondervan if the household that was living in a building that was
either rebuilt or refurbished through the AHO met the guidelines for being an AHO tenant is this the
intent. Councillor Zondervan responded that this would already be covered by the existing language.
The amendment was to address a situation where tenants are above the income limits and are displaced
from their home and would not be allowed to return.
Councillor Simmons spoke about the funding that AHO projects would have. She noted that this is
addressed in the memo by CDD. She stated that if an individual is at market rate and moves out and this
will bring the tenant back in. She stated that this is not the purpose of the AHO; the AHO is for
individuals under a certain percentage of AMI. Mr. Cotter noted that displacement relocation was
addressed in the CDD memo. He stated that the goal is not to displace household and work with
households to the extent where relocation may be needed whether it is temporary. In the case where
households may be eligible for AHO housing that may be created or permitted where a housing provider
will work to help someone identify options either within their other affordable housing stock or within the
market. This is problematic to have this type of definition in the zoning because it could conflict with
requirements of funding sources as well as present logistical issues where a family may need to be moved
to create a housing for seniors and to offer them the right to return would be challenging in terms of
compatibility if a building is designed for a certain population it may not be appropriate to have tenants
move back and they may have been options in a different type of housing. He added that from a policy
perspective this is supported and would want to work through this with the housing providers but to have
that element of the definition could be challenging from a practical standpoint as to how AHO housing
projects would be financed. On a voice vote amendment # 2 failed.
Amendment # 3. Councillor Carlone stated that this is the definition of a Net Zero Ready Building.
Councillor Carlone read the proposed definition. He stated that affordable housing developments are
more efficient than market rate housing because of costs and eliminating long-term heating and cooling
costs. He stated that this definition connects with a later amendment on making buildings meet this
standard. He favors doing as much as possible to be efficient.
Mr. Cotter this was addressed in the memo and recommended in the memo requiring a narrative for
affordable housing projects to show a path to net zero at some point in the future recognizing that getting
to net zero at this point can be prohibitively expensive and could undermine efforts to create affordable
housing if this requirement were set. He stated that affordable housing is seen as performing better and
advancing sustainability for using renewables and making the efforts to create housing that will be better
for residents, the community and to operate over time. This is challenging to have this requirement if this
were to be a prescriptive requirement. He stated that this definition is challenging as it refers to
maximizing without setting standards. He stated that if there were such a definition it was recommended
that there are clear standards so that an affordable housing provider would know what the baseline is to
meet that definition. He noted that the goal and intention is appreciated but recommends approaching this
in a different way. Councillor Carlone stated that the recommendation is to treat this as part of the overall
Net Zero Action Plan as far as phasing and not penalize prospective affordable housing. Mr. Cotter stated
that the intent in this concept for the AHO petition which was to look at affordable housing providers and
not require anything more of them than is now required in the market but trying to give them the
advantages to better compete in the market recognizing that the challenges to do that now.
Councillor Simmons suggested striking out this language based on the recommendations from CDD. She
acknowledged that the affordable housing developers built to the highest efficient standards. She noted
that this encumbers that process.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the City cannot allow emissions to increase and causing climate change
to continue to worsen and causing death. In 2013 a petition was filed that asked the City to increase
energy efficiency requirements and to require new construction be net zero and nothing has been done to
Packet Pg. 77

2.1

date. The City builds net zero with the King Open School Complex and leads by example and cannot ask
affordable housing developers to build net zero. He stated that this is not prohibitively expensive, and it
is inappropriate to use this term. He added that there is a health and safety issue as well where burning
gas in buildings pollutes the indoor air and is unhealthy for the occupants. This does not maximize
energy efficiency and are burdening the tenants with unnecessary high utility bills. He stated that from a
climate change perspective for the City to say that it needs to continue to build buildings that continue to
add to emissions, continue to make climate change worse and continue to kill people is not acceptable to
him. Councillor Carlone stated that in the Net Zero Plan what are the projected dates for housing to be
Net Zero. Councillor Zondervan responded it is 2022 for small residential construction and 2025 for
large residential and commercial buildings. He added that many of the affordable housing projects would
not fall under the Net Zero requirements until 2025.
Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about the CDD memo and asked why there would be a different way to do
this through a net zero narrative and if adopted this requirement would apply to affordable housing
projects subject to Green Building Requirements, generally projects of 25,000 square feet or more. When
will the Green Building Requirements be adopted? She stated that a project of 25,000 square feet is a 25unit building. She stated that it is not clear to her how many smaller AHO projects there will be and
asked if there will be AHO projects that will be less than 25,000 square feet. Mr. Cotter spoke about the
types of affordable housing this would affect. He stated that it is expected to see a range of project types
and a way to think about this is the number of units and more units are expected in larger buildings along
the corridors. One of the goals of the petition is to create opportunities in areas of the City where there is
no affordable housing. He spoke about the types of projects expected with a cap of 2.0 is expected to be
on smaller sites in the City. He stated that goal to create sustainable buildings is shared and is in the
housing priorities. He stated that this is to create affordable housing and the more that the affordable
housing providers are asked to do other things the more the intent is undermined. When this was
reviewed with the housing providers the reaction was that it would be more challenging to meet the
requirement. He stated that if the zoning has this type of requirement of a narrative for buildings that are
25,000 square feet it would become a fundamental eligibility criterion for the AHO.
Mr. Roberts addressed the question about the updates to Green Building Requirement. He stated that they
are currently being worked on and will be forwarded to the City Council shortly. This is complex and the
roll out of the NZAP. He stated that part of the complexity is that it does not fall entirely within the realm
of zoning. This needs to work with the energy code requirements which are not regulated by zoning. He
stated that finding the right way to balance zoning along with other standards and requirements and
figuring out what can and cannot be regulated is part of the challenge. He stated the roll out complexity
of the standards will be worked on by various departments.
Councillor Kelley appreciates the sentiment and the language that the City is continuing to build buildings
that are killing people is super extreme and not super helpful. He stated that the City has passed a plan
but is still waiting on a variety of ordinance suggestions to include things like modifying the zoning to
allow for different types of insulation that would otherwise bring the building into non-compliance. He
noted that there are no zoning requirements that push to Net Zero, there is a plan. Mr. Roberts stated that
the AHO zoning proposal refers to the Green Building requirements. He stated that as part of the NZAP
there are changes to Green Building Requirements that track the recommendations of the NZAP and
includes moving from a baseline standard from LEED Silver to LEED Gold. There are other association
improvements. She stated that there are other changes coming with this package, such as flexibility in
some zoning standards that are meant to enable adding insulation to an existing building which may be
non-conforming and may encounter issues with zoning if trying to add insulation to the exterior of a
building. He stated that in the AHO included some flexibility in the zoning that would enable these types
of improvements. He stated that there are increases in requirements that need to be met but there are also
changes meant to create more flexibility in the zoning that would enable improvements that might
otherwise not be able to be made. Councillor Kelley stated that he is confused about what is required at
this point and the down the line requirements for creating this plan. He is under the impression that it is
being done but not part of the zoning yet. He stated that this proposed amendment seems to leapfrog over
current City efforts to change the zoning and other rules to bring people into Net Zero. He added at some
Packet Pg. 78

2.1

point the current efforts will come to the City Council in the form of similar zoning changes. Mr. Roberts
responded in the affirmative and further stated that the approach with this proposal as initially conceived
is for projects being built under the AHO to continue to track the same environmental standards that
would apply to comparable residential developments and as they change in the future then affordable
housing projects over this AHO as well as all other residential projects would be subject to the same
uniform set of standards.
Councillor Mallon stated that there are extensive efforts that are being put into place, and this does
leapfrog. She spoke about the memo from CDD regarding requiring AHO projects to build to Net Zero
standards sooner than otherwise required for all development would put affordable housing builders at a
disadvantage relative to the developers of market rate housing. She stated that it is important not see any
more stunting of affordable housing and does not want this to stop affordable housing from being built.
She stated that she will not support this because of leapfrogging.
At this time Councillor Carlone called for the vote on amendment # 3. On this motion the roll was called
and resulted as follows:

Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor
Zondervan

and amendment # 3 –
Failed.
Amendment # 4. Councillor Carlone moved to remove this amendment to add a definition for
Permeable Parking. On an affirmative vote of 9 member the amendment was adopted.
Amendment # 7. Councillor Carlone amendment was to add after Section 4.35. the words “All such
ground floor uses shall”. He stated that in the revised text on page 5 contains language. He stated that
his amendment was services shall be provided to the general public.
Councillor Mallon stated that in her notes from August 8th she has that this amendment would be
discussed with amendment # 32 which was around retail space and whether it could be a use that was
non-retail but active related to abutters. Councillor Carlone noted that this is what the zoning specificity
calls out. This is active uses. She stated that on page 19 of the revised text in (e) it appears that CDD
took the spirit and intention of #7 and #32 and put them together in (e). Councillor Carlone noted that
question is the word “may” or “shall.”
Mr. Roberts spoke about section 11.207.4 entitle “Use.” This sets forth what uses are allowed. It is
important to establish clearly what uses are allowed. He explained that the AHO only applies to
residential uses but there is an exception in an affordable housing overlay project can have some nonresidential uses at the ground floor and it is important to clarify what those uses are. In the revised text
the reason for the addition is has to do with section 4.34 includes both office and lab uses and there was a
question if this meant to include labs and that it would be helpful to clarify that it is only office. This is
the reason for the text Paragraphs a. through e. This just states what uses are allowed and this is the
intent. He stated that if the City wants to be expansive and encourage active ground floor use it is helpful
to be as expansive as is reasonable so that there are different options for what that space can be used for.
Councillor Carlone noted that some districts require active ground floor, but this would negate that. Mr.
Roberts stated that this section of the zoning is meant to establish that in any zone in districts that allows
non-residential uses and could be districts that allow institutional uses, such as community centers,
libraries or social services and could include business districts that allow retail use or office districts that
allow office uses that in those districts if an affordable housing development is being built under the AHO
it can have one of these allowed uses at the ground floor. He stated that this zoning can be utilized for a

Packet Pg. 79

2.1

project that is all affordable housing plus one of these listed non-residential uses that are otherwise
allowed in the base zoning at the ground floor. This is not restrictive.
Councillor Kelley is confused about stories at ground, above and below grade which is found on page 18
of the revised text in paragraph (f) and what is allowed at ground stories. Councillor Carlone stated that
this will be addressed later.
Councillor Carlone stated that based on the explanation of Mr. Roberts he moved to remove his
amendment. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was removed.
Amendment # 8. Councillor Carlone stated that this is an amendment submitted by Councillor
Zondervan to insert in Section 4 Use a new (b) (i).
Councillor Zondervan stated that the idea is to protect existing retail or other services being provided on
ground floor in a building that is potentially being redeveloped under the AHO. He stated that the
motivation behind this is that there are a lot of single-story buildings along the transit corridors that
should have housing on the top. This overlay attempts to create these incentives that will allow this to
happen. He stated that without protection for these existing businesses or small business this would make
it less likely that those sites would get developed. He spoke about Mayor McGovern’s concern about
formula businesses but those can and often are owned by local small business owners who are operating a
franchise under a formula business brand. He stated that this underscores the tension and the challenge
with this approach because the City is trying to achieve many of the goals at the same time and cannot
simply prioritize one goal at the expense of others. He stated that there needs to be some way to protect
these existing buildings and using this protection as a way to unlock those development opportunities so
that both goals of producing more affordable housing and promoting small local businesses and
maintaining vitality on the street. Councillor Carlone stated that he agreed but the amendment is very
specific in a rental amount of 5% of the annual gross income. Councillor Zondervan commented that he
meant to state no greater than 5%. He stated that this was provided as the right amount to limit so that
the business would be able to operate in that space. He spoke about the vacant storefront across the City
because of the high rents and further stated that it is important to put a limit on the rent so that these
businesses are not being displaced.
Mayor McGovern stated that he is opposed to this because affordable housing developer would have to
relocate a major business and does not want to do this on the back of affordable housing developers; this
is not required of for-profit developers. He is open to any amendment that does not undermine the
financial viability of affordable housing. This would be impossible for an affordable housing developer
to do. He stated that the City needs to look at how to better support, particularly small businesses but
putting this on the backs of affordable housing developers is not right.
Councillor Siddiqui agreed with the Mayor. She stated that legally this is not tenable. This amendment is
unreasonably impractical. There is one goal from the beginning which is to figure out how to make
affordable housing more cost effective and this gets in the way of this goal. She commented that the City
is trying to figure out what can be done to help the City’s retailers. This does not make sense.
Councillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and it needs to be resolved.
Councillor Simmons understands the idea behind the amendment but it is putting a burden on something
that we are trying to correct through an economic development perspective on the AHO. She added that
the AHO is not the place for a cure all. This is prohibitive. She stated that the community-based builders
have stated that because of so many restrictions and financial burdens it is hard to build affordable
housing. She stated that this amendment may be well-intended it is a putting a strain on building
affordable housing and making it prohibitive. She requested Councillor Zondervan to withdraw his
amendment or she would have to vote against it.

Councillor Kelley asked when a Special Permit is issued outside of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay
District it requires some amount of retail at the ground floor could the Planning Board require absent the
base zoning that there be retail set aside for a project. City Solicitor Glowa responded that the only way
that the Planning Board can impose such a requirement is if it exists somewhere within the ordinance
provisions that relate to that Special Permit. Councillor Kelley spoke about Huron Village which does
not have a ground floor retail requirement and if an individual purchased property today and developed it
per the zoning ordinance they would not be required, and the Planning Board could not require them to
put in ground floor retail. Mr. Roberts stated that if zoning does not require it, it cannot be specifically
required. The Planning Board as part of a more holistic project review takes into account the character of
the area, what the planning for the area dictates and the desirable outcome. He stated that there are
instances where the Planning Board reviews a project for the first time and comments that the project
would be approved if there were retail at some place in the project on the ground floor and this is
something that evolves through project review. He stated that in the context of this proposal it would not
be appropriate for the Planning Board to require a particular retailer be brought back or put provisions in
place regarding the commercial rents that could be charged. Councillor Kelley stated that the lack of a
Special Permit process which is proposed for a variety of reasons and this changes the discussion for
whatever projects might come. He stated that if the AHO gets passed the rules change dramatically and it
is difficult to compare the new rules with current rules. He stated that there is some ability for the
Planning Board to push a project to have ground floor retail where the underlining zoning does not
require it but is not codified and cannot push overly hard. Mr. Roberts stated that much that is in the
AHO proposal does acknowledge that in many areas of the City projects do not require review by the
Planning Board. But the acknowledgement of the AHO is meant to create a permitting path that would
not require a Special Permit or Variance where they may otherwise might be required. He noted that the
AHO does impose specific requirements. He noted that the committee was currently discussing an
amendment on relocation and rent for existing retailers. He stated that elsewhere in the AHO there is a
requirement that in certain business districts where retail uses are allowed if there is an existing retail use
then the AHO must produce an active ground floor space that was intended to continue and support the
street front character of the area.
Mayor McGovern stated that it would be helpful to stick with the amendment that is in front of the
committee. He announced that these changes only apply under a very strict set of rules. This is not
about all development or all zoning. He stated that if a 100% affordable housing development is not
being built the extra height and the streamline permitting process does not apply. It is important to note
that under very specific projects only do these changes apply. This is for a 100% affordable housing
projects only.
Councillor Carlone stated that one of the prime areas for redevelopment is one-story retail districts and
will have an impact with retail that is struggling.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that there is a place mentioned later where it states that if there is existing
retail in a business district and refers to the AHO. She asked where this appears in the revised text. Mr.
Cotter stated that this on page 18 in the revised text in paragraph (e). The Ordinance Committee amended
the text from and to or. These would require an AHO project to include ground floor retail in projects
that are built on site that had a former retail site or abut another parcel that has a retail use. Mayor
McGovern stated that (e) on page 18 of the revised text is not the amendment being discussed. He added
that the amendment before the committee is an amendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan about
relocation fees and bringing retail back.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that on August 13th the Ordinance Committee voted on this. She added that
it is important to remember that the committee did vote on a provision for maintaining retail. She stated
that she understands that the amendment by Councillor Zondervan is different but wanted the committee
to have the conversation about relocation also remembering that there was a vote to keep the local retail.
She added that clearly there is a great deal of confusion about what this zoning actually states.

Councillor Zondervan commented that this amendment is being characterized as creating an obstacle to
affordable housing development and most of these sites will not be developed if there is not some
provision to protect the existing retailer in the building. He stated that by not having this provision this is
excluding good sites for affordable housing development and this is to unlock more opportunities for
affordable housing and if the associated costs are not paid for them the affordable housing will not be
built. He stated that this whole zoning is built on the fact that the City is funding, to a large extent, this
affordable housing construction. He stated that if the zoning is only addressed and these other obstacles
are not the goals may not be achieved of unlocking more affordable housing opportunities. There is a
need for something to protect existing businesses in sites that really should have 2-4 stories of affordable
housing above the retail.
Councillor Simmons stated that she did not agree with this in this context. She commented that the
zoning is a living document. She recommended vote the amendments the body can and then come back
to the other amendments. She urged Councillor Zondervan to withdraw this amendment or let the
Ordinance Committee vote on this.
Councillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and this needs to be solved. There are other
communities that builds affordable housing above retail.
The question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:

Amendment #13 and #14. Councillor Carlone stated that this has been modified in the presentation by
CDD. It was FAR in any district.
Mayor McGovern moved adoption of the recommendations by CDD appearing in the revised text
as 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density sections (a) and (b).
Mr. Roberts stated that his understanding from the last hearing is that there were some different
amendments proposed that would have set different standards for density limitation and were discussed
by the Ordinance Committee. The Ordinance Committee asked CDD to review the matter further and
came forth with a suggestion.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he believed that he also had an amendment in a different location. The
amendment was part of Amendment # 36 in subsection (d) as follows: Notwithstanding any other
requirements, any building permitted through the AHO shall be limited to a Floor Area Ratio
(FAR) of 3.0 or double the base zoning, whichever is less, to ensure sufficient land area for green
space to mitigate heat and flooding considerations of climate change. Mayor McGovern stated that
there were three amendments that dealt with FAR.
Mayor McGovern moved to strike amendment # 13. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the
amendment was adopted.
Councillor Carlone moved to strike amendment # 14. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the
amendment was adopted.

Vice Mayor Devereux questioned the BA-4 district created on Waldon and Sherman Streets relating to
the Masse Development. She stated that it would not be included in 2.0 cap; this is a small district. She
asked if this was an oversight by CDD not to because it allows height taller than the Masse Building
which is under 45 feet.
Mr. Robert stated that the overarching principal here is to apply the same variations in height and density
for affordable housing development under overlay within districts that are roughly comparable to each
other. The BA-4 district was modified to allow a specific development on a specific site, in terms of the
overall density and height limitations it is comparable to a Business A or a Business A-2 district. He
stated that adjustments were made to make the height lower and density higher but in most respects the
density and height are very comparable to Business A. He stated that under this AHO we wanted to treat
those districts in roughly comparable ways. Across all these districts, under the most recent height
amendment adopted by the Ordinance Committee where it currently allows 44-45 feet the AHO would
allow six story buildings. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she does not think this should be because the
Sherman Street district was created specifically to be financially feasible for this development to put
parking underground. This density was increased; the height was not increased. She stated that putting a
6-7 story building on Walden Street near Sherman Street is not the outcome wanted. This makes it
equivalent to what is allowed on North Massachusetts Avenue in a BA-2 district. This district cannot
support a 60-70-foot high building with an unlimited FAR. Councillor Carlone comment that this is an
unusual district in that there is very little business in this location. Vice Mayor Devereux does not think
that the BA-4 district extends across Walden Street to include Paddy’s. She stated that the zoning for
this section should be looked at more closely to see what the City wants to see there. Councillor
Kelley asked if Vice Mayor Devereux was submitting amendment of not. Vice Mayor Devereux stated
that this came up because she was looking at where the 2.0 FAR does not apply and prompted her to look
at why it does not apply and it is because the cut off for capping at 2.0 was to say which ones under the
current zoning have a 1.0 FAR or less and because this one was up zoned to help the developer to create
to 27 units of housing on the corner lot it was up zoned to 1.75 or 2.0 FAR if it has ground floor retail.
This was zoning to enable one project.
Vice Mayor Devereux made the following motion:
ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the Community
Development Department to review both the density and height under the AHO for
the BA-4 district and make a recommendation to the Ordinance Committee.

The motion was adopted on an affirmative vote of 8 members. Councillor Simmons was recorded
as present.
Mayor McGovern stated that he had previously made a motion to accept the recommendation of CDD for
2.0 and suggested voting on this amendment together with the amendment offered by Councillor
Zondervan.
The recommendation by CDD was in the revised text in section 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density in
subsection (a).
Councillor Carlone questioned that the only place the AHO will work is in areas with a FAR of less than
1.00. Mr. Roberts stated that the proposal is to establish a limit on the FAR in districts where the current
district standards would limit it to 1.0 or less. In other districts there would be no maximum FAR. This
would be as originally proposed where the development density would be limited by the overall height
and the other dimensional controls that are in place and there would not be a numerical limit on FAR.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the comparison chart has a table that shows each district FAR and the
proposed limit. He stated that his understanding of the language is that it only applies if the FAR is less
than 1.0. Mr. Roberts stated that there is no district that is 1.0.

Packet Pg. 83

2.1

Vice Mayor Devereux stated that this is trying to make these projects more financially attainable for
affordable developers and the ones in .5 districts have higher land values and is the 2.0 a rough guess and
how this will work as land values continue to increase. She noted that no districts are being referenced
and only referencing where the FAR is less than 1.0 assuming that the zoning passes and lasts for a
decade or two there is a possibility that the base zoning districts could change and asked if the committee
wanted a reference to the 1.0 or call out which districts this is about. Councillor Carlone stated that every
district should have a FAR and be honest about the FAR.
Mayor McGovern moved suspension of the rules in order to bring forward Councillor Zondervan’s
amendment #36 (d).
Councillor Zondervan moved to amend the recommendation by CDD by substitution with the language in
36 (d) for (a) in section 11.207.5.2.2. The question came on the motion to amend by substitution and the
roll was called and resulted as follows:

And the amendment –
Failed.
Mayor McGovern proceeded to move adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 residential density (a). On an
affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
Mr. Roberts clarified the language in 11.207.5.2.2. (b). He stated that in the original version of the
petition there was language to the effect that there would be no limitation FAR or lot area per dwelling
unit. He explained because now there is a limit on FAR there was the need to move the sentence.
Councillor Carlone moved adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the
amendment was adopted.
Amendment # 23. An amendment by Councillor Zondervan to amend (a) in Section 6 Parking and
Bicycle Parking.
Councillor Zondervan noted that this was referred to CDD to review the language.
Mr. Roberts stated that on page 12 of the revised text there is new language suggested to the effect of
what the Ordinance Committee voted on. He read the revised text in 11.207.6.1 (a). He stated that the
language was cleaner. He stated that language was added to 11.207.6.1 (b). He stated that in zoning the
standards only apply to parking spaces or loading bays. There are no specific standards for pick up and
drop off and deliveries. It was important to establish that the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department would have a role in certifying that such facilities are being provided in a way that is
reasonably suited to accommodate that activity in a way that would not cause significant hazard or
congestion and there would be the ability for Traffic and Parking to promulgate regulations so that
overtime there could be clearer standards put into place for what would constitute appropriate pick up,
drop off and delivery facilities.
Vice Mayor Devereux questioned why there would be either on or off-street deliveries because most of
this activity is wanted to be off-street. By removing the obligation to provide actual parking spaces does
not mean that there will not be any parking in these projects, but this is a broad thing to say.

Packet Pg. 84

2.1

Mr. Roberts stated that after consultation with Traffic, Parking and Transportation stated that things can
vary by scale and by existing conditions and if it is a small site or small number of units the concern is
having the ability for a small moving van which is routinely handled by Traffic and Parking by issuing
permits to allow for this on a temporary basis.
Councillor Zondervan moved to amend his amendment by substituting in the language suggested by
CDD in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On the motion to amend by substitution on an affirmative vote of 9
members the amendment was adopted. The question now came on adoption of the substituted
language in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amended language was
adopted.
Amendment #23C. An amendment by Vice Mayor Devereux. She stated that this was covered in the
memo from CDD on the cost of providing a TPass for a full year.
Mr. Roberts stated that there is commentary in the CDD memo under the Transportation Demand
Management section but is no change to the zoning text. He spoke about the issue of on-going
commitments.
Mr. Cotter spoke about the perspective of on-going costs and understanding the impact of offering a
TPass subsidy would mean to a project in terms of the subsidy and it was found to be significant. He
stated that issue as to whether or not such a subsidy on an on-going basis might be considered as income
was reviewed. He stated that under a strict definition of income it would be. He stated that at the bottom
of page 4 in the memo offered a recommendation to modify the petition text to change the provision of
discounted TPasses for three-month duration in the original petition to increase it to six-months.
Vice Mayor Devereux commented that what is in the memo did not migrate to the revised text. She
moved to amend section 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by striking out
three- months and substituting in place six-months. She announced that this only applies to AHO
projects that are not providing off-street parking at a ratio of .4 space per dwelling unit or more.
Councillor Simmons spoke about the impact of the TPass. She asked if the TPass would impact income.
Mr. Cotter stated that the definition of income under HUD regulations which are applicable to CHA and
other housing providers would likely suggest that providing on-going subsidies for a transit pass would be
considered income but do not think that it would rise to be considered income if it were provided on a
limited or short-term basis.
Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by
striking out three-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by
inserting six-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
Councillor Carlone now moved that acceptance of 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in
(a) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
Councillor Carlone moved a Recess at 2:56 PM.
On a motion by Councillor Carlone the hearing reconvened at 3:15 PM.
Amendment # 28. To amend 7.3 Building Façade. This amendment appears in the revised text in
11.207.7.3 (a) and incorporates the recommendations made by Councillor Carlone on the amount of glass
in facades going from 15% to 20 % on building facades facing a public street. He stated that the average
affordable housing is 23% and market rate housing is 28-30%. He stated that for buildings located in a
Business A, Business A-2, Business B or Business C district this figure shall be increased to 30% from
25%.

2.1

Councillor Carlone moved the amendment to 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 15% and inserting 20%.
On an affirmative vote of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was
recorded as present.
Councillor Carlone moved to amend in the business districts by striking out 25% and inserting in place
30%.
Councillor Mallon questioned if this was a recommendation by CDD or was this a change made based on
the discussion at the Ordinance Committee. Mr. Roberts stated that these were changes voted by the
Ordinance Committee. Councillor Carlone stated that these were not voted on by the Ordinance
Committee but were referred to CDD. He noted that he had written 30% residential and 70% active use
on the first floor. There is no comment on this.
Mr. Roberts stated that transparent window standards are in the zoning districts throughout the City to try
to promote a street friendly character building. He spoke about the overall there is a variation of the
windows across the City. He spoke about historic building having a friendly historic character the
percentage of windows may be 20-25% and is compatible with surrounding area and create a decent
streetscape. He stated that the more requirements in place the more limiting it is on design. He stated
another concern is if buildings are being expected to be meeting strong energy efficiency standards in
some cases requiring a large amount of clear windows could work counter to this and may have a
negative effect.
Mr. Thorkildsen stated that in looking at some example facades there were nice facades with a low
percentage of glass but had other architectural details. He stated the question about higher percentage
ratio on street facades in Business B etc. districts are a good idea but should check some examples. It is
not unreasonable to ask for more. Councillor Carlone asked about retail frontage. Mr. Thorkildsen stated
that 70% is a reasonable number.
Councillor Carlone commented that 15% is low and in older buildings the more there is vertical glass
windows per people is a friendlier building. He stated that 70% solid is a lot of solid in any room.
Mr. Roberts stated that the revised text on page 18 in section (iii) contained a requirement that the portion
containing active non-residential uses would be at least 50% transparent glass and based on the Ordinance
Committee amendment language was incorporated stating that if it is retail or consumer service it be 70%
along one street in case of a corner lot. The language was put in for greater clarity. Councillor Carlone
stated that the 30% should not include the ground floor in the calculation; this should be excluded and
separate.
Councillor Carlone moved adoption of the language in the revised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking
out 25% and inserting 30%. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
Councillor Carlone questioned the clarifying revisions by CDD and asked if they need to be adopted. Mr.
Roberts stated that in the revised text there are suggested changes made by CDD. There are also
clarifying revisions made by CDD.
City Solicitor stated that the intent was to strike the language in 11.207.7.3 (c) and in addition to
recommend adding this language into the Design Guidelines. She stated that a vote is required to strike
out the language. Councillor Carlone asked if this was added to the Guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen
responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Carlone moved to strike out in 11.207.7.3 (c) and move this to the Guidelines. On an
affirmative vote of 9 members this amendment was adopted.

City Solicitor Glowa, in response to a question by Councillor Carlone, stated that the committee needed
to move to substitute the entire document submitted by CDD with its various amendments or to vote each
clarifying amendment separately.
Councillor Carlone moved to substitute and replace existing language with the amended language
proposed or distributed by CDD to the entire City Council. No action taken.
Mayor McGovern suggested that the committee go through the document with the amendments and vote
on these amendments and then act on the revised text by CDD.
Amendment #30. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD was to provide the minimum dimensions for a twoway driveway.
Mr. Roberts stated that the width of driveways is regulated in Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance. He
stated that the minimum width each way for a one-way driveway is 10 feet and a two-way driveway
would be 20 feet. Councillor Carlone asked if there is a need for a walkway on the side of the driveway.
This is contained in the revised text in 11.207.7.4 (b).
Mr. Roberts stated that there was discussion at the last Ordinance Committee hearing about the amount of
space needed for a driveway or a curb cut and is in the zoning in Article 6, so this does not need to be
specified in the zoning. He stated that the maximum in residential districts is 20 feet for residential streets
and in other districts the maximum is 30 feet.
City Solicitor Glowa noted that any contextual change needs to be voted upon by the Ordinance
Committee. The multicolored document has been what has been worked on. The language in the revised
text does contain additional language changes and if the City Council wishes to consider the additional
changes it should be voted upon at this time while discussing this section or if there is interest by the
committee to move all the changes in this document it would be a different option.
Councillor Carlone noted that it could be more specific. He remembers it being principal street on a
corner lot. He asked could this be the longer street.
Mr. Roberts stated that the one change that was not voted on in this motion. He stated that the request
was for CDD to provide the minimum dimension for a two-way driveway. His understanding of the
intent of the 75% of the length of the façade to exclude the driveway access and that is why this additional
language is there and would need to be voted on. He stated that his recommendation would be to leave
this as it is in the revised text.
Councillor Carlone moved to accept the language provided by CDD in 11.207.7.4 (b). On an
affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.
City Solicitor Glowa informed the City Council that any textual changes will need to be voted on by the
committee. will this undue any of the changes previously made. She added that the committee has been
going through the multicolored document which listed a number of changes that were either voted upon
from the original time that document was made. The revised text, the blue document is the text of the
actual petition with the changes that CDD and with the assistance of the Law Department has reviewed
and provided the changes that were explicitly voted upon by the committee or changes that were
requested by the committee. The staff was working from the actual petition language and this other
document is confusing.
Councillor Simmons asked the City Solicitor if the committee took a vote on the textual changes would
this undue or change anything that was not voted on up to this point.
Mr. Roberts stated that the only change that the committee has voted on today that is not reflected in the
revised text is the change regarding the TPass subsidy from three months to six months. The changes that
Packet Pg. 87

2.1

the Ordinance Committee has voted on were changes that were incorporated into the revised text and
other clarifying text changes.
City Solicitor Glowa there is no question of undoing any votes taken. She stated that if committee wishes
to it could move to adopt all of the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the multicolor
document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text these changes can be inserted into the
revised text so that moving forward there would be one integrated document with changes voted upon.
Councillor Simmons moved to adopt all the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the
multicolored document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text and that they be
inserted into the revised text. Councillor Carlone suggested that this motion be made at the end of the
amendments.
Mayor McGovern noted that there are only a few more amendments to go and when completed CDDs
amendment can be moved to be accepted. If this is moved out of committee today, CDD will produce a
clean document of the text.

Amendment #36B. Councillor Zondervan stated that B is about the Net Zero Ready which was placed
on hold pending Article 22 amendments to be submitted to the City Council in September which has a
definition of Net Zero Ready. He added that this can be kept on hold or vote to strike this amendment.
Mayor McGovern moved to strike in 7.6 (b). The question now came on the amendment and the roll

and the amendment to strike out 36B was Adopted.
Amendment #36 (c). Councillor Mallon question that the language in the revised text was what was
voted on by the committee.
Mr. Roberts stated that in the CDD memo there was a request at the last Ordinance Committee to study
the cost implications which are incorporated into a section of the CDD memo on tree protection. The
language has been incorporated on page 20 in 11.207.7.6 (c) intended to be cleaner. He stated that it is
funny to state in zoning that the zoning states that these requirements apply from another ordinance is the
one that might exempt projects under this overlay from being subject. This is what was incorporated into
the draft. Councillor Mallon wanted to ensure that the committee was voting on the CDD language rather
than what was presented in the multicolored document.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that in the CDD language it states it shall comply with the requirements of
such ordinance to the extent that it would be required to comply if not an AHO project. Vice Mayor
Devereux asked what other projects do not have to comply with the Tree Ordinance. Mr. Roberts stated
that under the zoning ordinance only some projects are required to comply with the provisions of the Tree
Protection Ordinance as set forth in the zoning and also in the Tree Protection Ordinance.
Councillor Simmons commented on the CDD memo on page 5 that states making AHO project subject to
the requirements of the Tree Ordinance it will make some cost complications. She noted that the whole
idea of the AHO was to make it easier or facilitate the building of affordable housing units. She will vote
Packet Pg. 88

2.1

present because it may complicate the AHO and adds a small obstacle in this process. The intent was to
clear or make easier the path and this does not do this.
Councillor Zondervan suggested amendment the CDD language by striking out AHO and inserting in
place affordable housing project because it may make it clearer.
City Solicitor Glowa stated that the Tree Protection Ordinance does not apply to afford housing projects
and this language was intended to make it clear that AHO projects would be exempt from the
requirements of the Tree Protection Ordinance.
Councillor Simmons asked does this make it more difficult for developers under the AHO.
Mr. Cotter stated that it does make it more complicated to comply with the Tree Protection Ordinance.
He stated that adding any requirement does make things more complicated from the standpoint of a
housing development provider. This amendment would eliminate the exemption.
Councillor Simmons stated that this provides a restriction even though well intended and she would be
inclined not to support this amendment.
Councillor Zondervan moved his amendment to strike out AHO and insert affordable housing
project and then substitute the revised text language for his original amendment. On a voice vote
of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present.
The question now came on the motion to substitute the amended revised text for his amendment to the
original petition. On this question the roll was called and resulted as follows:

adopted.
Amendment #36A. Councillor Mallon asked is ISD able to decide based on whether this is fully shielded.
City Solicitor Glowa stated that shielded may be more appropriate than fully-shielded. She stated
that she will look at existing language, confer with the Commissioner of Inspectional Services and
report back to the committee at the next meeting.
Councillor Mallon wanted fully shielded kept.
Amendment #41 Overlay Design Consultation Objectives.
Councillor Carlone wanted to state the objectives clearly.
City Solicitor Glowa stated that one of the sensitivities here is the appealability of any. In this case this
case the requirement for a Special Permit has been removed but a developer of an AHO project would
still need a building permit and building permits are appealable. By having language that is more
subjective or qualitative as opposed to quantitative requirements there is the possibility that this could
Packet Pg. 89

2.1

open the City or developer up to having a building permit appealed on the basis that there are some
unclear standards here in the zoning ordinance. An opponent of the project could state that they did not
meet the requirements. So, the recommendation was to move these into the Design Guidelines so that
they are guiding the process for the consultation that will occur with the Planning Board of Design
Review but not be mandatory requirements that would need to be met in order to obtain a building permit
because this could create some additional legal hurtles.
Councillor Carlone stated that he does not see why this cannot be a guide to the Planning Board in their
evaluations. He has concern with non-binding review by the City.
Mayor McGovern stated that there is vagueness and leaves it open to interpretation. He likes the
guidance and if it goes in the zoning it is harder to assess. This should be in the guidelines and not in
zoning.
Councillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board would use this as an evaluation of whether or not it
meets the intent. He noted that the Guidelines mean nothing.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked how the Design Guidelines get promulgated or voted upon. Councillor
Carlone stated that he feels that guidelines should be voted upon. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that
CDD does not want to put guideline in zoning and how is guidelines implemented.
City Solicitor Glowa stated that in the revised text in 11.207.9 the City Manager has authority to
promulgate regulations and Design Guidelines was added to CDD.
Councillor Mallon spoke about changes to the Guidelines, one of which was a pre-designed analysis of
the character of the street was a change in the design guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that Pre-design
analysis of the character of the street was incorporated in a section in the guideline includes the language
on page 7 and page 10. Councillor Mallon stated that CDD will have input based on the design
guidelines as set forth in this document and intended to be complied with.
Councillor Carlone asked who is responsible for doing the analysis of the context of the street. Mr.
Thorkildsen responded the proponent. Councillor Carlone asked who will review this. Mr. Thorkildsen
stated that it is the basis of the community meetings and the Planning Board’s review and the Affordable
Housing Trust’s review.
Mr. Roberts stated that one of the changes made in the CDD text to add an additional required community
meeting to the process to share the site and street context analysis with the residents and other interested
parties prior to building design and to receive feedback.
Councillor Carlone asked what binds the developer to follow this. Mr. Cotter stated that given the
economics of this builders will be building with subsidy funds or coming to the Affordable Housing
Trust. He stated that having a report from the Planning Board and staff to the Affordable Housing Trust
on the design advisory review and the process that the project went through with the neighbors. With this
it is expected that the objectives will be achieved.
On a motion to move Amendment #41 to the guidelines on an affirmative vote of 9 members the
motion was adopted.
Amendments #42-43 and 43A. Councillor Mallon stated that in the revised text CDD has taken the
essence of the conversation of the three amendments together. Councillor Carlone moved that the
three proposed amendments #42, 43 and 43A be removed. On a voice vote of 9 members the
amendment was adopted.
Councillor Carlone moved to substitute the text from CDD in 11.207.11 (a) and (b) Review of

Vice Mayor Devereux commented on the Five-Year Progress Review. She asked should the Planning
Board be involved in a five-year review. Mr. Roberts stated that if it is the will of the committee to add
this language it could be added. Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend section (b) to add after Council,
the Planning Board.
Councillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter if the Planning Board reviews housing policy. Mr. Cotter
responded that the Planning Board will review housing policies that intersect with zoning. Vice Mayor
Devereux noted that this is zoning. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD is staff to the Planning Board.
Mr. Cotter stated that he would like to share the report with the Planning Board and the Affordable
Housing Trust. Councillor Simmons moved to amend to add the Affordable Housing Trust.
Mayor McGovern stated that there is a difference between sharing a report or being part of the evaluation.
This should be done after CDD does evaluation. He will vote to share the evaluation with the Planning
Board and the Affordable Housing Trist and not be part of the evaluation.

Councillor Kelley moved to amend section 11.207.2 to add a new (c) that reads:
(c)
An AHO project shall not be permitted on any property whose units are already no more
than 100% of AMI.
He explained his amendment. The housing project are not under 1.0 FAR and limited to a 2.0 FAR and
may never be redeveloped.
Councillor Zondervan stated is this stating that this should not apply to those already providing affordable
housing.
Councillor Carlone stated that Councillor Kelley’s amendment is to consider not allowing this to happen
where there is existing reasonable density, low-moderate income housing.
Councillor Kelley stated that if the AHO passes as currently written there may be incentives such as
redeveloping existing affordable housing developments because this may be the most cost-effective way
to get more affordable housing.
Councillor Siddiqui stated that she is not comfortable voting on the substantive amendment. At
Roosevelt towers is undergoing renovations and it is not to increase units. She will not support this
amendment.
Councillor Simmons stated that this would prevent an existing affordable housing developer from
increasing density. Councillor Kelley stated that the AHO as proposed may provide incentives that are
difficult to ignore; this may not happen, but it is a possibility. Councillor Simmons stated that she would
not support this amendment.
Councillor Toomey stated that he would not vote in favor of this amendment.

Vice Mayor Devereux commented on Open space in 11.207.5.2.4 (a). She stated that the open space can
be reduced to 15% regarding historic preservation. She asked how necessary this is and why cut the open
space in half in exchange for protecting historic projects. She noted that when this was originally drafted
all of the open space had to be at ground level and subsequently the committee voted to allow 25% of the
open space to be above ground if a common roof deck or balcony. She noted that this is not a good idea.
She stated that in section (b) exempting AHO projects from the requirement that is in the rest of the
zoning which some of the open space has to be in a configuration of a 15 X 15 space which is eliminated
and without this it means that the open space can be met. She wanted to see a site plan to see how this
works and not eliminating so much usable open space that we have no place to plant trees.
Councillor Zondervan questioned why just completely exempt an historical building or reduce by 50%
because it is a historic building.
Councillor Carlone stated that the rationale is the historic buildings 2.5 stories high and the rest is 4
stories the units above are missing or you cannot build right up to the historic building on the side.
Mayor McGovern commented that there is no formal amendment.
Mayor McGovern moved to substitute the entirety of the AHO language as introduced with
amendments offered by CDD except as they might conflict with actions taken on September 3, 2019.
On an affirmative vote of 9 members the motion carried.
Mayor McGovern moved to forward the AHO ordinance as amended to the full City Council with a
favorable recommendation. On this motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:

April 1, 2019
To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am submitting the attached proposed Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance to the City Council
which would, among other things, create a social equity and economic empowerment applicant preference
for proposed cannabis businesses in the City. The recent zoning ordinance passed on December 17, 2018
by the Council provided at §11.806 that the zoning for cannabis businesses would take effect on April 20,
2019 “or upon passage of a ‘Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance,’ whichever comes first.” After the
Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance is enacted, actions required by the City Council relating to
cannabis businesses in the City would be completed.
This draft Ordinance creates an independent permitting process that all cannabis businesses in the City
will be required to satisfy as a condition to operating in Cambridge. The Ordinance applies to Cannabis
Retail Stores, Cannabis Cultivators, Cannabis Product Manufacturers and Cannabis Transporters. The
Ordinance creates an initial two-year period of exclusivity allowing only Priority Applicants, as defined
in the Ordinance, to obtain a Cannabis Business Permit in the City. After the two years, other applicants
may also be granted Cannabis Business Permits. Group A Priority Applicants are defined in the
Ordinance as those certified by the Commonwealth as Economic Empowerment or Social Equity Program
applicants, or a Women or Minority Owned business. Group B Priority Applicants are existing
Registered Marijuana Dispensaries (“RMDs”) selling medical cannabis who also want to sell retail
cannabis. All applicants must satisfy the ten permitting requirements listed in section 5 of the Ordinance.
The permitting process will be primarily administered and enforced by the Inspectional Services
Department. However, the Community Development Department, Public Health Department and the
Police Department will also have a role to play in the administration and enforcement of the Ordinance
provisions. In brief, the Ordinance proposes the following steps in the overall City permitting process for
Cannabis Businesses:
a. Priority Applicants to request certification as such by the Director of the Economic
Development Division of the Community Development Department;
b. All applicants to enter into a Host Community Agreement with the City to be executed by the
City Manager and the applicant;
c. All applicants to apply for and obtain a Planning Board special permit in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance;

Packet Pg. 308

2.4

d. All applicants to obtain all other permits and approval required by State and local laws and
regulations to the extent that such other permits and approvals can be obtained prior to the
City’s issuance of the Cannabis Business Permit; and
e. All applicants to obtain the Cannabis Business Permit from the Inspectional Services
Department provided for by the attached Ordinance.
The Cannabis Business Permit will be subject to annual renewal and will be subject to revocation
if the holder violates the applicable laws and/or permit conditions. Both ISD and CDD will have
authority to promulgate regulations to implement the Ordinance with respect to their respective Ordinance
responsibilities.
This Ordinance has been informed by discussions that have taken place over the past several months at
the City Council and its Public Safety Committee, Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee,
and Economic Development and University Relations Committee. This draft was prepared with the
participation of several departments, including the Law Department, Community Development
Department, Public Health Department, Inspectional Services Department, Police Department, Traffic,
Parking and Transportation Department, Department of Human Services Programs and License
Commission.

In the Year Two Thousand and Nineteen
AN ORDINANCE

That the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be amended as follows:
To replace the current text of Section 4.22 with the following text:
4.22

Accessory Apartments. The purpose of this Subsection 4.22 is to allow for the creation of
accessory apartments in all districts. Many large existing single and two-family dwellings or
other accessory buildings on their lots are underutilized. Alteration of these buildings to provide
one additional dwelling unit on the lot would be prohibited in most cases due to the existing
floor area ratio and/or lot area per dwelling unit requirements of Subsection 5.31, among other
zoning limitations. Given contemporary lifestyles, housing needs, and energy and maintenance
costs, it is beneficial to the City to allow greater flexibility in the use of such buildings to add new
dwelling units without substantially altering the environmental quality of their surrounding
neighborhoods. This Subsection 4.22 gives the Board of Zoning Appeal the authority to relax
such requirements in certain instances as enumerated below.

4.22.1 In all districts the Board of Zoning Appeal may grant a special permit for the alteration of an
existing single-family detached dwelling, two-family dwelling, or accessory building on the same
lot as a single-family or two-family dwelling to provide one accessory apartment if the following
conditions are met:
1. The building containing the accessory apartment has been in existence since on or before
February 1, 2019.
2. In the case of an accessory apartment within a single-family or two-family dwelling, prior to
alteration the dwelling contains at least one thousand eight hundred (1800) square feet of
gross floor area.
3. In the case of an accessory apartment within a single-family or two-family dwelling, such
accessory apartment shall not occupy more than 900 square feet or thirty-five (35) percent
of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is less. An accessory apartment
created within an accessory building shall not occupy more than 900 square feet.
4. No more than one accessory apartment shall be allowed on any lot.
4.22.2 In all districts any existing two-family dwelling may be converted to a single-family detached
dwelling with one accessory apartment by right, without need for a Special Permit, if the
conditions set forth in Section 4.22.1 above are met.

1. Accessory apartments shall not be counted in applying the lot area per dwelling unit
limitations of the zoning district.
2. The Board may relax applicable floor area ratio (FAR) or gross floor area (GFA) limitations, to
the extent necessary, to enable the creation of an accessory apartment within the envelope
of an existing structure; however, any additional GFA created outside the envelope of the
existing structure shall comply with applicable FAR or GFA limitations for the lot.
3. The Board may alter applicable yard setback or height limitations, to the extent necessary,
to enable site improvements that may be required to ensure the safe habitation of the
accessory apartment, including but not limited to emergency egress routes; however, any
movement or alteration to the principal exterior walls or roof of a building shall comply with
applicable yard setback and height limitations for the lot.
4. No off-street parking shall be required for an accessory apartment.
4.22.4 In granting a special permit for an accessory apartment, the Board shall determine that the
General Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance are met and
that any alterations that are visible from the exterior of the building shall be compatible with
the appearance and character of the neighborhood and are minimally necessary to enable the
creation of the accessory apartment. The Board may impose such conditions as it may deem
appropriate to ensure ongoing compliance with such criteria and to avoid undue detriment to
the neighborhood or to nearby persons or property.

Passed to a second reading as amended at the City Council
meeting held on April 22, 2019 and on or after May 6, 2019
the question comes on passage to be ordained.

Proposed Changes to the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance

Introduction
I offer these proposed changes in response to concerns raised by my colleagues and members of the
public at the April 11, 2019 Ordinance Committee hearing. I believe these simple changes will address
many of the concerns raised and will allow us to move forward expediently with one of the most equitable
cannabis licensing processes in the Commonwealth. The biggest proposed change is to simply exclude
non-priority applicants entirely, and to limit Priority B applicants to RMDs that are already operational or
permitted in the city. I have included a red-lined version of the draft ordinance immediately following
descriptions of the proposed changes.

Add low-income Cambridge residents to Priority A
This expands the definition of a “Group A Priority Applicant” to also give priority to Cambridge residents
making below 50% of AMI. The window to qualify for Economic Empowerment designation has closed
at the state level, so this would create an avenue for people to continue to qualify based on their economic
status. A geographical preference on its own lets anybody buy their way in.

Change Priority B to Exclude Future RMDs
This changes the definition of a “Group B Priority Applicant” to exclude future RMDs (ones that aren’t
already operating/permitted in the city at the time of ordination) from obtaining priority status. I’m also
proposing here to exclude existing RMD’s from obtaining priority A status.

City Councillor

Changes to Permitting Preferences for Priority Applicants
Here I’m proposing to strike the two-year exclusionary period in section 4A, which means the city would
ONLY issue permits to Priority applicants, indefinitely. I’m also proposing that we strike section 4B
entirely, which would mean that the city would NEVER issue permits to non-Priority applicants. Future
councils could of course change either of these, of course.

Changes to Permitting Requirements
Here I am proposing we strike sections 5A2 and 5A3 entirely. By excluding all non-priority applicants
indefinitely, we are giving priority applicants a huge advantage. With that change, it makes sense to strike
these sections because we don’t want to put burdensome requirements on priority applicants that could
ultimately undermine their success. As written, the city could deny a license renewal if a minority-owned
business hires 49% minority employees. I don’t think that is consistent with our intent. We should trust
our priority applicants to have every incentive to lift up their own communities, without imposing
additional restrictions on them and unnecessarily giving the city more power to oppose them.

Clarify Host Community Agreement Process
Where it is mentioned in both 5A10 and 6, we should clarify that the host community agreement is
negotiated through the City Manager’s office.

Enforcement
We should remove the “3 strikes you’re out” provision in section 8 because even a single violation of
selling to an underage minor should be punishable by denial of license.

Store, Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product Manufacturer and/or Cannabis Transporter
(collectively “Cannabis Business”) applicants to certify compliance with certain conditions in the

to Priority Applicants, as defined herein.

Manufacturer and/or Cannabis Transporter.
Cannabis Cultivator. An entity licensed by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission as

Commission as a Marijuana Product Manufacturer to obtain, manufacture, process and package
cannabis or marijuana products and to transfer these products to other cannabis or marijuana
establishments, but not to consumers.

marijuana products to consumers for use off the premises, but not to cultivate, manufacture,

Retailer or registered as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, also known as a Registered
Marijuana Dispensary (hereafter “RMD”), or both, in accordance with applicable applicate state
laws and regulations.
Cannabis Transporter. An entity, not otherwise licensed by the Cannabis Control
Commission, that is licensed to purchase, obtain, and possess cannabis or marijuana, or

Cambridge resident earning less than 50% of AMI in the tax year prior to application-to be known as Group A Priority Applicants.

b. Group B Priority Applicant. An RMD operating within the City at the time of
ordination that will sell cannabis products in a Cannabis Retail Store pursuant to the
Commonwealth’s medical use of marijuana laws, either alone or in addition to operating
as a licensed marijuana retailer pursuant to the Commonwealth’s adult use of marijuana
laws-- to be known as Group B Priority Applicants. Those who qualify as Group B
priority applicants cannot also qualify for Group A.

3. Applicability
This Chapter shall apply to any proposed Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product Manufacturer,
Cannabis Retail Store, or Cannabis Transporter that is seeking licensure from the Cannabis

Cannabis Business Ordinance Follow Up Inquiry

At our Ordinance Committee meeting on 11 April to talk about the proposed Cannabis
Business Ordinance, Committee members had a number of questions and concerns, some of
which we asked City staff to address as quickly as possible, so we could reconvene equally
quickly and try to solidify this Ordinance and create adult cannabis sales opportunity in
Cambridge.
Given the Committee’s overarching belief that our Cannabis Business Ordinance should,
as much as possible, try to create a more equitable world, we wanted to know the legal limits the
Council faces in:
1. Altering the proposed 2-year license limitation of .040(b) or even eliminating it
completely.
2. Can we legally require non-equity retail stores to provide shelf or floor space for
permitted equity/empowerment applicants?
3. Can we use any fees generated from cannabis sales in a targeted way to assist
equity/empowerment applicants in areas such as:
a. Subsidized loans
b. Business training
c. Legal assistance
4. Pertaining to Host Community Agreements, which were a choke point in the process
noted during public comment:
a. How much discretion does the Manager have in approving/denying them
b. Can we/should we put specifics about how they are issued in this ordinance
5. If we do not allow all currently permitted RMDs to become adult use retail, how do we

a. Lottery?
b. Only ones in operation as of a certain date (such as date of ordination)
c. Other?
6. Should we redefine our “Group A” and “Group B” terminology to
a. Set income limits for qualification
b. Set residential requirements to Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Areas.
c. Set criteria for membership in these groups so that if the criteria are not met, the
permit would not be granted (somewhat along the lines of setting out percentage
requirements under .050)
7. Can we drop the number of illegal sales to 1 rather than three prior to allowing for
revocation of a license?
8. Pertaining to the percentage requirements for employees and board members under
.050(a)2 and 3:
a. Is this legal in any way?
b. If it is legal, can we phase in percentage changes over time to allow the makeup to
morph from what exists now in some companies
c. Are convicted felons excluded from participating and, if so, can we insert
language that changes that constraint
9. Given that the state has set ownership limits, can we further limit how many
establishments, and of what type, any one owner has in Cambridge?
10. Would the ordinance be the proper place to put in information about timelines, points of
contact and so forth or would we have a separate guidance document for that?
11. Can we use this Ordinance to set up a process to keep equity/empowerment applicants
from setting up shop virtually, or even literally, next door to each other? There was some
concern expressed that, absent such a limitation, places like Central Square may only
have one non-equity cannabis facility but may have a huge number of equity shops.
12. How can we make sure that Equity and Empowerment applicants are not pitted against
each other? Is that something we should worry about?
13. How would we go about reviewing how successful our attempts at providing an equitable
program actually turn out to be? Can we put relevant language in the Ordinance?
I appreciate the work everyone, including City staff, applicants, members of the public
and Councilors is putting into trying to make this new law and related business opportunities
reflect the drive for justice we all feel. Given the imperfections of the state law within which we
must work, I imagine there are some things we cannot legally do, some things that may be less
clear and some things that are obviously under our jurisdiction. Understanding all of that will
help the Council get to the best possible place.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This memo is in response to Policy Order #3 from the March 25th City Council
Meeting (Awaiting Report 19-39), which requests the creation of an “arts
friendly” page and related navigation on the City of Cambridge website
highlighting the key licenses and permits available to support artists, arts
organizations, and creative enterprises in developing and producing their work
for the benefit of local and regional audiences.
Working in partnership with the Cambridge License Commission and the
Information and Technology Department, Cambridge Arts created a dedicated
web landing page that provides an organized approach and direct access to
specific municipal licenses and permits that are most frequently required by
artists and organizations to produce and carry out their work. This information
and list were informed by the participating departments and expanded by
Cambridge Arts to include key additional permits issued by the Department of
Public Works and Traffic, Parking & Transportation.
The expanded list of permits and licenses is informed by the work that
Cambridge Arts does to support local and regional creatives throughout the
year via core programs, including: Cambridge Arts Grant Program, Public
Art/Percent-for-Art, Cambridge Street Performer Program, and a variety of
produced events such as Cambridge Arts River Festival, Cambridge Arts Open
Studios, Summer in the City, Cambridge Poetry Programs, and Cambridge Arts
Creative Marketplace. Importantly, it also took as a guide the licenses and
permits most frequently issued to those individuals and organizations
approved by the DPW Special Events Committee to conduct work in
Cambridge.

Awaiting Report 19-14, Policy Order #4

This memo is in response to Policy Order #4 from the February 11th City
Council Meeting (Awaiting Report 19-14), which requests a report on
conducting surveys of local arts organizations and private foundations that
may support their work locally and efforts to make this information more
readily available on the City of Cambridge website and through other
communication sources. Based on discussions amongst staff from our two
departments, we have the following information to report to the City Council.
Cambridge is a city that is home to many and varied arts organizations that
provide significant services, connection, presentation, and other
opportunities to showcase and celebrate the work of local and regional
artists and creatives. This work connects positively to residents, regional
audiences, and visitors to the City and inspires joy, positive community
engagement, beautification of public spaces, and powerful cultural
experiences that strengthen the social fabric of the community. In
addition, local arts organizations employ people from Cambridge and the
region, purchase goods and services from other local businesses, and
attract tourists to visit and spend time and money in the City. Given these
important roles and outcomes from their presence in our midst, it is
important to know these organizations, where they are located, and what
support they need to thrive and carry out their mission-driven work.
Working collaboratively, Cambridge Arts and Economic Development
Division of Community Development have arrived at the following
outcomes that will provide a better understanding of what organizations

exist, their location in the city, and the general impact they have through
services and programming to neighborhoods, retail districts, and the city more
generally.
Arts Organizations Inventory & Survey Information
In partnership with Americans for the Arts (AFTA), the nation’s lead arts
advocacy and research organization, and with financial support from the Barr
Foundation locally, Cambridge Arts implemented the Arts & Economic Prosperity
5 initiative to conduct an economic impact and audience study of the nonprofit
arts and culture sector in the City. As one of 300 partners across all 50 states
and the District of Columbia, Cambridge Arts collected detailed financial and
audience data about our local nonprofit arts and cultural organizations in a
broad array of focus areas and disciplines, including: theater, music, dance,
visual art and museums, film, festivals and arts education. The study provided
an opportunity for the City and surveyed arts organizations to gain a clearer
understanding of the local impact of the arts in Cambridge and quantify the
impact of the arts in the areas of jobs and employment, the purchase of goods
and services from local businesses, and the significant role that arts play in
driving tourism and economic development in the City.
This study began in 2016 and was conducted over a period of 18-months
through a direct partnership with the City’s Economic Development Division of
Community Development. Through this partnership, staff jointly secured data
through organizational surveys, questionnaires, and via direct audience
intercepts. The report also accessed and utilized data from the Massachusetts
Cultural Council and DataArts, a national database and study of organizational
capacity, economic health, and employment. As part of the preparation for the
study, significant review was conducted to create local outreach lists that could
ensure that we had the broadest possible representation and participation from
local arts-focused organizations for the data received. Data sources came from
the following partners and initiatives and has been used to make key updates to
the information provided to artists and the community via the “Resources”
section of the Cambridge Arts and City of Cambridge website.

The Arts Mean Business
By Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts
In my travels, I meet business and government leaders who speak passionately about
the value the arts bring to their communities—fueling creativity, beautifying
downtowns, and providing joy. Many also share with me the challenge of balancing arts
funding with the demands to support jobs and grow their economy. To these community
leaders, Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 offers a clear and welcome message: the arts
are an investment that delivers both community well-being and economic vitality.
Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 (AEP5) is Americans
for the Arts’ fifth economic impact study of the
nation’s nonprofit arts and cultural organizations and
their audiences. By every measure, the results are
impressive. Nationally, the nonprofit arts industry
generated $166.3 billion of economic activity in
2015—$63.8 billion in spending by arts and cultural
organizations and an additional $102.5 billion in eventrelated expenditures by their audiences. This activity
supported 4.6 million jobs and generated $27.5 billion
in revenue to local, state, and federal governments (a
yield well beyond their collective $5 billion in arts
allocations). AEP5 is the most comprehensive study of
its kind ever conducted. It provides detailed economic
impact findings on 341 study regions representing all
50 states and the District of Columbia. Data was
gathered from 14,439 organizations and 212,691 arts
event attendees, and our project economists customized
input-output models for each and every study region to
ensure reliable and actionable localized results.
When Americans for the Arts published its first
economic impact study in 1994, it worked with 33
local communities. As evidence of the value of these
studies, AEP5 has grown this local participation tenfold. We also have witnessed a corresponding growth
in the understanding of the economic value of the arts.
The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example,
now publishes an annual Arts & Cultural Production
Satellite Account, which extends beyond the nonprofit
sector to include the full breadth of commercial and
for-profit arts, education, and individual artists, and
lists the sector as a $730 billion industry (4.2 percent of
the nation’s GDP—a larger share of the economy than

AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS | Arts & Economic Prosperity 5

transportation, tourism, agriculture, and construction).
As another example, many state and local governments
have established agencies to track and grow their
creative economy.
What continues to set AEP5 apart from other studies is
exactly why it is so useful: it uses localized research
that not only focuses on arts organizations—but also
incorporates the event-related spending by their
audiences. When patrons attend an arts event, they may
pay for parking, eat dinner at a restaurant, enjoy dessert
after the show, and return home to pay the babysitter.
The study found that the typical attendee spends $31.47
per person, per event beyond the cost of admission.
AEP5 also shows that one-third of attendees (34
percent) traveled from outside the county in which the
arts event took place. Their event-related spending was
more than twice that of their local counterparts ($47.57
vs. $23.44). What brought those visitors to town? Twothirds (69 percent) indicated that the primary purpose
for their visit was to attend that arts event. The message
is clear: a vibrant arts community not only keeps
residents and their discretionary spending close to
home, it also attracts visitors who spend money and
help local businesses thrive.
AEP5 demonstrates that the arts provide both cultural
and economic benefits. No longer do community
leaders need to feel that a choice must be made
between arts funding and economic development.
Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 proves that they can
choose both. Nationally as well as locally, the arts
mean business.

“Even in a strong economy, some may perceive the arts as an
unaffordable luxury. Fortunately, this rigorous report offers evidence that
the nonprofit arts industry provides not just cultural benefits to our
communities, but also makes significant positive economic contributions
to the nation’s financial well-being regardless of the overall state of the
economy. The arts as a driver of employment, vibrancy, tourism, and
building a creative workforce is certainly something to applaud.”

The Economic Impact of the
Nonprofit Arts and Culture Industry in
the City of Cambridge
Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 provides evidence that the nonprofit arts and culture
sector is a significant industry in the City of Cambridge—one that generates $174.8
million in total economic activity. This spending—$119.8 million by nonprofit arts
and cultural organizations and an additional $55 million in event-related spending by
their audiences—supports 6,129 full-time equivalent jobs, generates $98.3 million in
household income to local residents, and delivers $13.6 million in local and state
government revenue. This economic impact study sends a strong signal that when we
support the arts, we not only enhance our quality of life, but we also invest in the City
of Cambridge’s economic well-being.
This Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study documents
the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture
sector in 341 study regions—113 cities, 115 counties,
81 multicity or multicounty regions, 20 states, and 12
arts districts—representing all 50 U.S. states and the
District of Columbia. The diverse study regions range
in population (1,500 to four million) and type (rural to
large urban). Economists customized input-output
models to calculate specific and reliable findings for
each study region. This study focuses solely on the
economic impact of nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations and event-related spending by their
audiences. Spending by individual artists and the forprofit arts and culture sector (e.g., Broadway or the

Defining Economic Impact
This proprietary study methodology uses four economic
measures to define economic impact: full-time
equivalent jobs, resident household income, and local
and state government revenues.
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Jobs describes the total
amount of labor employed. An FTE job can be one fulltime employee, two half-time employees, etc.
Economists measure FTE jobs, not the total number of
employees, because it is a more accurate measure that
accounts for part-time employment.
Resident Household Income (often called Personal
Income) includes salaries, wages, and entrepreneurial
income paid to residents. It is the money residents earn
and use to pay for food, shelter, utilities, and other
living expenses.
Revenue to Local and State Government includes
revenue from local and state taxes (e.g., income, sales,
lodging, real estate, personal property, and other local
option taxes) as well as funds from license fees, utility
fees, filing fees, and other similar sources. Local
government revenue includes funds to governmental
units such as city, county, township, and school
districts, and other special districts.

Economic Impact of Spending
by the Nonprofit Arts and Culture Industry
(Combined Spending by Both Organizations and Their Audiences)
in the City of Cambridge
In communities coast-to-coast, from our smallest towns to our largest cities, America’s 100,000 nonprofit arts and
cultural organizations make their communities more desirable places to live and work every day of the year.
The arts and culture provide inspiration and joy to residents, beautify public spaces, and strengthen the social
fabric of our communities. Nonprofit arts and cultural organizations are also businesses. They employ people
locally, purchase goods and services from other local businesses, and attract tourists. Event-related spending by
arts audiences generates valuable revenue for local merchants such as restaurants, retail stores, parking garages,
and hotels.
During fiscal year 2015, spending by both the City of Cambridge’s nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations and their audiences totaled $174.8 million. The table below demonstrates the total economic
impact of these expenditures.

“The success of my family’s business depends on finding and cultivating a
creative and innovative workforce. I have witnessed firsthand the power of
the arts in building these business skills. When we participate personally
in the arts, we strengthen our ‘creativity muscles,’ which makes us not just
a better ceramicist or chorus member, but a more creative worker—better
able to identify challenges and innovative business solutions.”
— Christopher Forbes, Vice Chairman, Forbes, Inc.

Economic Impact: Total, Direct, Indirect, and Induced
How can a dollar be respent? Consider the example of a theater company that purchases a five-gallon bucket
of paint from its local hardware store for $100—a very simple transaction at the outset, but one that initiates a
complex sequence of income and spending by both individuals and other businesses.
Following the paint purchase, the hardware store may use a portion of the $100 to pay the sales clerk
who sold the bucket of paint. The sales clerk then respends some of the money for groceries; the
grocery store uses some of the money to pay its cashier; the cashier then spends some of the money
for rent; and so on.
The hardware store also uses some of the $100 to purchase goods and services from other businesses,
such as the local utility company, and then to buy a new bucket of paint from the paint factory to
restock its shelf. Those businesses, in turn, respend the money they earned from the hardware store to
buy goods and services from still other local businesses, and so on.
Eventually, the last of the $100 is spent outside of the community and no longer has a local economic
impact. It is considered to have leaked out of the community.
The total economic impact describes this full economic effect, starting with the theater’s initial paint purchase
and ending when the last of the $100 leaks out of the community. It is composed of the direct economic
impact (the effect of the initial expenditure by the theater), as well as the indirect and induced economic
impacts, which are the effects of the subsequent rounds of spending by businesses and individuals,
respectively.
Interestingly, a dollar ripples very differently through each community, which is why an input-output model
was customized for the unique economy of Middlesex County.

Economic Impact of Spending
by Nonprofit Arts and Cultural ORGANIZATIONS
in the City of Cambridge
Nonprofit arts and culture organizations are active contributors to their business community. They are employers,
producers, and consumers. They are members of the Chamber of Commerce as well as key partners in the
marketing and promotion of their cities, regions, and states. Spending by nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations totaled $119.8 million in the City of Cambridge during fiscal year 2015. This spending is farreaching: organizations pay employees, purchase supplies, contract for services, and acquire assets within their
community. These actions, in turn, support jobs, generate household income, and generate revenue to local and
state governments.
The City of Cambridge’s nonprofit arts and cultural organizations provide rewarding employment for more than
just administrators, artists, curators, choreographers, and musicians. They also employ financial staff, facility
managers, and salespeople. In addition, the spending by these organizations directly supports a wide array of other
occupations spanning many industries that provide their goods and services (e.g., accounting, construction, event
planning, legal, logistics, printing, and technology).
Data were collected from 35 eligible nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that are located in the City of
Cambridge. Each provided detailed budget information for fiscal year 2015 (e.g., labor, payments to local and
nonlocal artists, operations, administration, programming, facilities, and capital expenditures/asset acquisition).
The following table demonstrates the total economic impact of their aggregate spending.

Economic Impact Beyond Dollars: Volunteerism
While arts volunteers may not have an economic impact as defined in this study, they clearly have an enormous
impact by helping nonprofit arts and cultural organizations function as a viable industry. Arts & Economic
Prosperity 5 reveals a significant contribution to nonprofit arts and cultural organizations as a result of
volunteerism. During 2015, a total of 2,934 volunteers donated a total of 149,286 hours to the City of
Cambridge’s participating nonprofit arts and cultural organizations. This represents a donation of time
with an estimated aggregate value of $3,517,178 (Independent Sector estimates the dollar value of the average
2015 volunteer hour to be $23.56). Volunteers can include unpaid professional staff (e.g., executive and program
staff, board/commission members), artistic volunteers (e.g., artists, choreographers, designers), clerical
volunteers, and service volunteers (e.g., ticket takers, docents, ushers, gift shop volunteers).
The 35 participating organizations reported an average of 83.8 volunteers who volunteered an average of 50.9
hours during 2015, for a total of 4,265.3 hours per organization.

The Value of In-Kind Contributions to Arts Organizations
The organizations were asked about the sources and value of their in-kind support. In-kind contributions are noncash donations such as materials (e.g., office supplies from a local retailer), facilities (e.g., office or performance
space), and services (e.g., printing from a local printer). The 35 participating nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations in the City of Cambridge reported that they received in-kind contributions with an aggregate
value of $2,471,390 during fiscal year 2015. These contributions can be received from a variety of sources
including corporations, individuals, local and state arts agencies, and government agencies.

"Investments in arts and culture enhance the quality of life, the third-highest
measurement businesses use when gauging development trends—behind skilled
labor and highway accessibility but ahead of other factors such as corporate tax
rates and incentives. These investments are breathing new life into our downtown
areas, creating educational opportunities, and attracting businesses and highly
skilled workers to Iowa. Today, nearly 6,000 arts organizations employ 23,000
people in Iowa, and that number jumps to 73,000 when all creative fields are
counted. In all, that's about four percent of our workforce."
— Governor Kim Reynolds, Iowa

Economic Impact of Spending
by Nonprofit Arts and Cultural AUDIENCES
in the City of Cambridge
The nonprofit arts and culture industry, unlike most industries, leverages a significant amount of event-related
spending by its audiences. For example, when patrons attend a cultural event, they may pay to park their car,
purchase dinner at a restaurant, shop in nearby stores, eat dessert after the show, and pay a babysitter upon their
return home. Attendees from out of town often spend the night in a hotel. This spending generates related
commerce for local businesses such as restaurants, parking garages, retail stores, and hotels. Local businesses that
cater to arts and culture audiences reap the rewards of this economic activity.
To measure the impact of spending by cultural audiences in the City of Cambridge, data were collected from 775
event attendees during 2016. Researchers used an audience-intercept methodology, a standard technique in which
patrons are asked to complete a short survey about their event-related spending (while they are attending the
event). In the City of Cambridge, cultural attendees spent an average of $34.04 per person, per event as a direct
result of their attendance at the event.
The 35 participating nonprofit arts and cultural organizations reported that the aggregate attendance to their events
was 1.6 million during 2015. Event-related spending by these attendees totaled $55 million in the City of
Cambridge during fiscal year 2015, excluding the cost of event admission. The following table demonstrates the
total economic impact of this spending.

Why exclude the cost of admission? The admissions paid by attendees are excluded from the audience analysis because those
dollars are captured in the operating budgets of the participating nonprofit arts and cultural organizations and, in turn, are spent by
the organizations. This methodology avoids “double-counting” those dollars in the study analysis.

Cultural Tourists Spend More
The 775 audience survey respondents were asked to provide the ZIP code of their primary residence, enabling
researchers to determine which attendees were local residents (live within Middlesex County) and which were
nonresidents (live outside Middlesex County). In the City of Cambridge, researchers estimate that 48.3 percent of
the 1.6 million nonprofit arts attendees were residents; 51.7 percent were nonresidents.
Nonresident attendees spent an average of 71 percent more per person than local attendees ($42.53 vs.
$24.95) as a result of their attendance to cultural events. As would be expected from a traveler, higher
spending was typically found in the categories of lodging, meals, and transportation. When a community attracts
cultural tourists, it harnesses significant economic rewards.

Each of the nonresident survey respondents (i.e., those who live outside Middlesex County) were asked about the
purpose of their trip: 80.8 percent indicated that the primary purpose of their visit to the City of Cambridge
was “specifically to attend this arts/cultural event.” This finding demonstrates the power of the arts to attract
visitors to the community.
The audience-intercept survey also asked nonresident attendees if they would have traveled somewhere else
(instead of to the City of Cambridge) if the event where they were surveyed had not occurred: 60.9 percent of
nonresident attendees would have “traveled to a different community to attend a similar cultural event.”
Of the 51.7 percent of arts attendees who are nonresidents, 7.0 percent reported an overnight lodging expense. Not
surprisingly, nonresident attendees with overnight expenses spent considerably more money per person during
their visit to the City of Cambridge than did nonresident attendees without overnight lodging expenses ($136.77
and $35.44, respectively). For this analysis, only one night of lodging expenses is counted toward the audience
expenditure, regardless of how many nights these cultural tourists actually stayed in the community. This
conservative approach ensures that the audience-spending figures are not inflated by non-arts-related spending.

The Arts Retain Local Dollars
The survey also asked local resident attendees about what they would have done if the arts event that they were
attending was not taking place: 51.9 percent of resident attendees said they would have “traveled to a
different community to attend a similar cultural event.”
The cultural tourism findings on this page demonstrate the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture
industry in its truest sense. If a community fails to provide a variety of artistic and cultural experiences, not only
will it fail to attract new dollars from cultural tourists, it will also lose the discretionary spending of its own
residents who will travel elsewhere for a similar experience.

"As a banker, I have visited businesses in almost every city and town in my state.
There is a visible difference in places with a vibrant arts community. I see people
looking for places to park, stores staying open late, and restaurants packed with
diners. The business day is extended and the cash registers are ringing!"

Past President, American Bankers Association

Conclusion
The nonprofit arts and culture sector is a $174.8 million industry in the City of
Cambridge—one that supports 6,129 full-time equivalent jobs and generates
$13.6 million in local and state government revenue.

Nonprofit arts and cultural organizations are businesses in their own right. They spent
$119.8 million during fical year 2015 to employ people locally, purchase goods and
services from local establishments, and attract tourists. They also leveraged a
remarkable $55 million in additional spending by cultural audiences—spending that
pumps vital revenue into restaurants, hotels, retail stores, parking garages, and other
local businesses.

This study puts to rest a misconception that communities support arts and culture at
the expense of local economic development. In fact, communities that support the arts
and culture are investing in an industry that supports jobs, generates government
revenue, and is the cornerstone of tourism. This Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study
shows conclusively that the arts mean business in the City of Cambridge!

The Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 Calculator
To make it easier to compare the economic impacts of different organizations within the City of Cambridge (or to
calculate updated estimates in the immediate years ahead), the project researchers calculated the economic impact
per $100,000 of direct spending by nonprofit arts and cultural organizations and their audiences.

Economic Impact Per $100,000 of Direct Spending by ORGANIZATIONS
For every $100,000 in direct spending by a nonprofit arts and cultural organization in the City of Cambridge, there
was the following total economic impact.

Full-Time Equivalent Jobs

An Example of How to Use the Organizational Spending Calculator Table (above):
An administrator from a nonprofit arts and cultural organization that has total expenditures of $250,000 wants to
determine the organization’s total economic impact on full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in the City of
Cambridge. The administrator would:
1. Determine the amount spent by the nonprofit arts and cultural organization;
2. Divide the total expenditure by 100,000; and
3. Multiply that figure by the FTE employment ratio per $100,000 for the City of Cambridge.
Thus, $250,000 divided by 100,000 equals 2.5; 2.5 times 4.34 (from the top row of data on Table 1 above) equals
a total of 10.9 full-time equivalent jobs supported (both directly and indirectly) within the City of Cambridge by
that nonprofit arts and cultural organization. Using the same procedure, the estimate can be calculated for resident
household income as well as for local and state government revenue.

The economic impact of event-related spending by arts audiences can also be derived for an individual
organization or groups of organizations in the City of Cambridge.
The first step is to determine the total estimated event-related spending by attendees who are residents of
Middlesex County. To derive this figure, first multiply the total attendance by the percentage of attendees that are
residents. Then, multiply the result by the average per person event-related expenditure by resident attendees. The
result is the total estimated event-related spending by resident attendees.
The second step is to do the same for nonresidents of Middlesex County. To derive this figure, first multiply the
total attendance by the percentage of attendees that are nonresidents. Then, multiply the result by the average per
person event-related expenditure by nonresident attendees. The result is the total estimated event-related spending
by nonresident attendees.
Then, add the results from the first two steps together to calculate the total estimated event-related audience
spending. Finally, the ratios of economic impact per $100,000 in direct spending can then be used to determine the
total economic impact of the total estimated audience spending.

2.6.c

An administrator wants to determine the total economic impact of the 25,000 total attendees to his/her
organization’s nonprofit arts and cultural events on full-time equivalent (FTE) employment in the City of
Cambridge. The administrator would:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Multiply the total attendance by the percentage of attendees that are residents;
Multiply the result of step 1 by the average per person event-related expenditure for residents;
Multiply the total attendance by the percentage of attendees that are nonresidents;
Multiply the result of step 3 by the average per person event-related expenditure for nonresidents;
Sum the results of steps 2 and 4 to calculate the total estimated event-related audience spending;
Divide the resulting total estimated audience spending by 100,000; and
Multiply that figure by the FTE employment ratio per $100,000 for the City of Cambridge.

Thus, 25,000 times 48.3% (from Table 8 on the preceding page) equals 12,075; 12,075 times $24.95 (from Table
8) equals $301,271; 25,000 times 51.7% (from Table 8) equals 12,925; 12,925 times $42.53 equals $549,700;
$301,271 plus $549,700 equals $850,971, $850,971 divided by 100,000 equals 8.51; 8.51 times 1.68 (from the top
row of data on Table 9 on the preceding page) equals a total of 14.3 full-time equivalent jobs supported (both
directly and indirectly) within the City of Cambridge by that nonprofit arts and cultural organization. Using the
same procedure, the estimate can be calculated for resident household income as well as for local and state
government revenue.

Making Comparisons with Similar Study Regions
For the purpose of this analysis and unique report, the geographic region being studied is defined as the City of
Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Census Bureau, the
population of the City of Cambridge was estimated to be 109,694 during 2015. For comparison purposes, 458
pages of detailed data tables containing the study results for all 341 participating study regions are located in
Appendix B of the National Statistical Report. The data tables are stratified by population, making it easy to
compare the findings for the City of Cambridge to the findings for similarly populated study regions (as well as
any other participating study regions that are considered valid comparison cohorts).
The National Summary Report and National Brochure are available both by download (free) and hardcopy
(for purchase). The National Statistical Report (more than 500 pages in length) is available by download
only. All documents and resources can be found at www.AmericansForTheArts.org/EconomicImpact.

About This Study
This Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study was conducted by Americans for the Arts
to document the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture industry in 341
communities and regions (113 cities, 115 counties, 81 multi-city or multi-county
regions, 20 states, and 12 individual arts districts)—representing all 50 U.S. states
and the District of Columbia.
The diverse local communities range in population
(1,500 to four million) and type (rural to urban).
The study focuses solely on nonprofit arts and
cultural organizations and their audiences. The
study excludes spending by individual artists and
the for-profit arts and entertainment sector (e.g.,
Broadway or the motion picture industry). Detailed
expenditure data were collected from 14,439 arts
and culture organizations and 212,691 of their
attendees. The project economists, from the
Georgia Institute of Technology, customized inputoutput economic models for each participating
study region to provide specific and reliable
economic impact data about their nonprofit arts and
culture industry: full-time equivalent jobs,
household income, and local and state government
revenue.

The 250 Local, Regional, and
Statewide Study Partners
Americans for the Arts published a Call for
Participants in 2015 seeking communities interested
in participating in the Arts & Economic Prosperity
5 study. Of the more than 300 potential partners
that expressed interest, 250 local, regional, and
statewide organizations agreed to participate and
complete four participation criteria: identify and
code the universe of nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations in their study region; assist
researchers with the collection of detailed financial
and attendance data from those organizations;
conduct audience-intercept surveys at cultural
events; and pay a modest cost-sharing fee (no
community was refused participation for an

AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS | Arts & Economic Prosperity 5

inability to pay). Thirty of the 250 partners included
multiple study regions as part of their AEP5
participation (e.g., a county as well as a specific city
located within the county). As a result, the 250 local,
regional, and statewide organizations represent a total
of 341 participating study regions.
The Cambridge Arts Council responded to the
2015 Call for Participants, and agreed to complete
the required participation criteria.

Surveys of Nonprofit Arts and
Cultural ORGANIZATIONS
Each of the 250 study partners identified the universe
of nonprofit arts and cultural organizations that are
located in their region(s) using the Urban Institute’s
National Taxonomy of Exempt Entity (NTEE)
coding system as a guideline. The NTEE system—
developed by the National Center for Charitable
Statistics at the Urban Institute—is a definitive
classification system for nonprofit organizations
recognized as tax exempt by the Internal Revenue
Code. This system divides the entire universe of
nonprofit organizations into 10 Major categories,
including “Arts, Culture, and Humanities.” The
Urban Institute reports that approximately 100,000
nonprofit arts and cultural organizations were
registered with the IRS in 2015.
The following NTEE “Arts, Culture, and
Humanities” subcategories were included in this
study:

To collect the required financial and attendance
information from eligible organizations, researchers
implemented a multipronged data collection process.
Americans for the Arts partnered with DataArts to
collect detailed budget and attendance information
about each organization’s fiscal year that ended in
2015. DataArts’ Cultural Data Profile (CDP) is a
unique system that enables arts and cultural
organizations to enter financial, programmatic, and
operational data into a standardized online form. To
reduce the survey response burden on participating
organizations, and because the CDP collects the
detailed information required for this economic
impact analysis, researchers used confidential CDP
data as the primary organizational data collection
mechanism for the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5
study. This primary data collection effort was
supplemented with an abbreviated one-page paper
version of the survey that was administered to
organizations that did not respond to the CDP survey.

A99 – Arts, Culture, and Humanities (miscellaneous)

In addition to the organization types listed above,
the study partners were encouraged to include other
types of eligible organizations if they play a

20

substantial role in the cultural life of the community
or if their primary purpose is to promote participation
in, appreciation for, and understanding of the visual,
performing, folk, literary arts, and/or media arts.
These include government-owned and governmentoperated cultural facilities and institutions, municipal
arts agencies and councils, private community arts
organizations, unincorporated arts groups, living
collections (such as zoos, aquariums, and botanical
gardens), university presenters and cultural facilities,
and arts programs that are embedded under the
umbrella of a nonarts organization or facility (such as
a community center or church). In short, if it displays
the characteristics of a nonprofit arts and cultural
organization, it is included. With rare exception, forprofit businesses and individual artists are excluded
from this study.

Nationally, information was collected from 14,439
eligible organizations about their fiscal year 2015
expenditures, event attendance, in-kind contributions,
and volunteerism. Responding organizations had

budgets ranging from $0 to $785 million
(Smithsonian Institution). Response rates for the
341 communities ranged from 9.5 percent to 100
percent and averaged 54.0 percent. It is important to
note that each study region’s results are based
solely on the actual survey data collected. No
estimates have been made to account for
nonparticipating eligible organizations. Therefore,
the less-than-100 percent response rates suggest an
understatement of the economic impact findings in
most of the individual study regions.
In the City of Cambridge, 35 of the 67 eligible
nonprofit arts and cultural organizations
identified by the Cambridge Arts Council
participated in this study—a participation rate
of 52.2 percent

Surveys of Nonprofit Arts and
Cultural AUDIENCES
Audience-intercept surveying, a common and
accepted research method, was conducted in all 341
of the study regions to measure event-related
spending by nonprofit arts and culture audiences.
Patrons were asked to complete a short survey
while attending an event. Nationally, a total of
212,691 attendees completed a valid survey. The
randomly selected respondents provided itemized
expenditure data on attendance-related activities
such as meals, retail shopping (e.g., gifts and
souvenirs), local transportation, and lodging. Data
were collected throughout 2016 (to account for
seasonality) as well as at a broad range of both paid
and free events (a night at the opera will typically
yield more audience spending than a weekend
children’s theater production or a free community
music festival, for example). The survey
respondents provided information about the entire
party with whom they were attending the event.
With an overall average travel party size of 2.56
people, these data actually represent the spending
patterns of more than 544,489 cultural attendees.

AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS | Arts & Economic Prosperity 5

In the City of Cambridge, a total of 775 valid
audience-intercept surveys were collected from
attendees to arts and cultural performances,
events, and exhibits during 2016.

Economic Analysis
A common theory of community growth is that an
area must export goods and services if it is to prosper
economically. This theory is called economic-base
theory, and it depends on dividing the economy into
two sectors: the export sector and the local sector.
Exporters, such as automobile manufacturers, hotels,
and department stores, obtain income from customers
outside of the community. This “export income” then
enters the local economy in the form of salaries,
purchases of materials, dividends, and so forth, and
becomes income to residents. Much of it is respent
locally; some, however, is spent for goods imported
from outside of the community. The dollars respent
locally have an economic impact as they continue to
circulate through the local economy. This theory
applies to arts organizations as well as to other
producers.

Studying Economic Impact Using
Input-Output Analysis
To derive the most reliable economic impact data,
input-output analysis is used to measure the impact of
expenditures by nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations and their audiences. This is a highlyregarded type of economic analysis that has been the
basis for two Nobel Prizes. The models are systems
of mathematical equations that combine statistical
methods and economic theory in an area of study
called econometrics. They trace how many times a
dollar is respent within the local economy before it
leaks out, and it quantifies the economic impact of
each round of spending. This form of economic
analysis is well suited for this study because it can be
customized specifically to each study region.
To complete the analysis for the City of
Cambridge, project economists customized an

input-output model based on the local dollar
flow among 533 finely detailed industries within
the unique economy of Middlesex County. This
was accomplished by using detailed data on
employment, incomes, and government revenues
provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce
(County Business Patterns, the Regional Economic
Information System, and the Survey of State and
Local Finance), local tax data (sales taxes, property
taxes, and miscellaneous local option taxes), as well
as the survey data from the responding nonprofit
arts and cultural organizations and their audiences.

The Input-Output Process
The input-output model is based on a table of 533
finely detailed industries showing local sales and
purchases. The local and state economy of each
community is researched so the table can be
customized for each community. The basic
purchase patterns for local industries are derived
from a similar table for the U.S. economy for 2012
(the latest detailed data available from the U.S.
Department of Commerce). The table is first
reduced to reflect the unique size and industry mix
of the local economy, based on data from County
Business Patterns and the Regional Economic
Information System of the U.S. Department of
Commerce. It is then adjusted so that only
transactions with local businesses are recorded in
the inter-industry part of the table. This technique
compares supply and demand and estimates the
additional imports or exports required to make total
supply equal total demand. The resulting table
shows the detailed sales and purchase patterns of
the local industries. The 533-industry table is then
aggregated to reflect the general activities of 32
industries plus local households, creating a total of
33 industries. To trace changes in the economy,
each column is converted to show the direct
requirements per dollar of gross output for each
sector. This direct-requirements table represents the
“recipe” for producing the output of each industry.

22

The economic impact figures for Arts & Economic
Prosperity 5 were computed using what is called an
“iterative” procedure. This process uses the sum of a
power series to approximate the solution to the
economic model. This is what the process looks like
in matrix algebra:
T = IX + AX + A2X + A3X + ... + AnX.
T is the solution, a column vector of changes in each
industry’s outputs caused by the changes represented
in the column vector X. A is the 33 by 33 directrequirements matrix. This equation is used to trace
the direct expenditures attributable to nonprofit arts
organizations and their audiences. A multiplier effect
table is produced that displays the results of this
equation. The total column is T. The initial
expenditure to be traced is IX (I is the identity matrix,
which is operationally equivalent to the number 1 in
ordinary algebra). Round 1 is AX, the result of
multiplying the matrix A by the vector X (the outputs
required of each supplier to produce the goods and
services purchased in the initial change under study).
Round 2 is A2X, which is the result of multiplying
the matrix A by Round 1 (it answers the same
question applied to Round 1: “What are the outputs
required of each supplier to produce the goods and
services purchased in Round 1 of this chain of
events?”). Each of columns 1 through 12 in the
multiplier effects table represents one of the elements
in the continuing but diminishing chain of
expenditures on the right side of the equation. Their
sum, T, represents the total production required in the
local economy in response to arts activities.
Calculation of the total impact of the nonprofit arts
on the outputs of other industries (T) can now be
converted to impacts on the final incomes to residents
by multiplying the outputs produced by the ratios of
household income to output and employment to
output. Thus, the employment impact of changes in
outputs due to arts expenditures is calculated by
multiplying elements in the column of total outputs

by the ratio of employment to output for the 32
industries in the region. Changes in household
incomes, local government revenues, and state
government revenues due to nonprofit arts
expenditures are similarly transformed. The same
process is also used to show the direct impact on
incomes and revenues associated with the column
of direct local expenditures.

Frequently Used Terms
Cultural Tourism
Travel directed toward experiencing the arts, heritage, and special character of a place.

Direct Economic Impact
A measure of the economic effect of the initial expenditure within a community. For example, when the
symphony pays its players, each musician’s salary, the associated government taxes, and full-time equivalent
employment status represent the direct economic impact.

Direct Expenditures
The first round of expenditures in the economic cycle. A paycheck from the symphony to the violin player and a
ballet company’s purchase of dance shoes are examples of direct expenditures.

Econometrics
The process of using statistical methods and economic theory to develop a system of mathematical equations that
measures the flow of dollars between local industries. The input-output model developed for this study is an
example of an econometric model.

Econometrician
An economist who designs, builds, and maintains econometric models.

Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Jobs
A term that describes the total amount of labor employed. Economists measure FTE jobs—not the total number of
employees—because it is a more accurate measure of total employment. It is a manager’s discretion to hire one
full-time employee, two half-time employees, four quarter-time employees, etc. Almost always, more people are
affected than are reflected in the number of FTE jobs reported due to the abundance of part-time employment,
especially in the nonprofit arts and culture industry.

Indirect and Induced Economic Impact
This study measures the economic impact of the arts using a methodology that enables economists to track how
many times a dollar is respent within the local economy, and thus to measure the economic impact generated by
each round of spending. When a theater company purchases paint from the local hardware store, there is a
measurable economic effect of that initial expenditure within a community. However, the economic benefits
typically do not end there, because the hardware store uses some of its income to pay the clerk that sold the paint,
as well as to pay its electric bill and to re-stock the shelves. The indirect and induced economic impacts are the
effects of the subsequent rounds of spending by businesses and individuals, respectively. (See the example on
Page 5 of this report.)

2.6.c

A system of mathematical equations that combines statistical methods and economic theory in an area of
economic study called econometrics. Economists use this model (occasionally called an inter-industry model) to
measure how many times a dollar is respent in, or “ripples” through, a community before it “leaks out” of the local
economy by being spent non-locally (see Leakage below). The model is based on a matrix that tracks the dollar
flow among 533 finely detailed industries in each community. It allows researchers to determine the economic
impact of local spending by nonprofit arts and cultural organizations on jobs, household income, and government
revenue.

Leakage
The money that community members spend outside of the local economy. This non-local spending has no
economic impact within the community. A ballet company purchasing shoes from a non-local manufacturer is an
example of leakage. If the shoe company were local, the expenditure would remain within the community and
create another round of spending by the shoe company.

Multiplier (often called Economic Activity Multiplier)
An estimate of the number of times that a dollar changes hands within the community before it leaks out of the
community (for example, the theater pays the actor, the actor spends money at the grocery store, the grocery store
pays its cashier, and so on). This estimate is quantified as one number by which all expenditures are multiplied.
For example, if the arts are a $10 million industry and a multiplier of three is used, then it is estimated that these
arts organizations have a total economic impact of $30 million. The convenience of a multiplier is that it is one
simple number; its shortcoming, however, is its reliability. Users rarely note that the multiplier is developed by
making gross estimates of the industries within the local economy with no allowance for differences in the
characteristics of those industries, usually resulting in an overestimation of the economic impact. In contrast, the
input-output model employed in Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 is a type of economic analysis tailored specifically
to each community and, as such, provides more reliable and specific economic impact results.

Resident Household Income (often called Personal Income)
The salaries, wages, and entrepreneurial income residents earn and use to pay for food, mortgages, and other
living expenses. It is important to note that resident household income is not just salary. When a business receives
money, for example, the owner usually takes a percentage of the profit, resulting in income for the owner.

Revenue to Local and State Government
Local and state government revenue is not derived exclusively from income, property, sales, and other taxes. It
also includes license fees, utility fees, user fees, and filing fees. Local government revenue includes funds to city
and county government, schools, and special districts.

Frequently Asked Questions
How were the 341 participating communities and regions selected?
In 2015, Americans for the Arts published a Call for Participants for communities interested in participating in the
Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study. Of the more than 300 participants that expressed interest, 250 agreed to
participate and complete four participation criteria: (1) identify and code the universe of nonprofit arts and cultural
organizations in their study region; (2) assist researchers with the collection of detailed financial and attendance
data from those organizations; (3) conduct audience-intercept surveys at cultural events; and (4) pay a modest
cost-sharing fee (no community was refused participation for an inability to pay). Thirty of the 250 partners
included multiple regions as part of their participation (e.g., a county as well as a city located within the county);
as a result, the 250 local, regional, and statewide partners represent a total of 341 participating study regions.

How were the eligible nonprofit arts organizations in each community selected?
Local partners attempted to identify their universe of nonprofit arts and cultural organizations using the Urban
Institute’s National Taxonomy of Exempt Entity (NTEE) codes as a guideline. Eligible organizations included
those whose primary purpose is to promote appreciation for and understanding of the visual, performing, folk, and
media arts. Government-owned and government-operated cultural facilities and institutions, municipal arts
agencies and councils, private community arts organizations, unincorporated arts groups, living collections (such
as zoos, aquariums, and botanical gardens), university presenters and cultural facilities, and arts programs that are
embedded under the umbrella of a non-arts organization or facility (such as a hospital or church) also were
included if they play a substantial role in the cultural life of the community. For-profit businesses and individual
artists are excluded from this study.

What type of economic analysis was done to determine the study results?
An input-output economic analysis was customized for each of the participating study regions to determine the
economic impact its nonprofit arts and cultural organizations and arts audiences. Americans for the Arts, which
conducted the research, worked with highly regarded economists to design the input-output models.

What other information was collected in addition to the arts surveys?
In addition to detailed expenditure data provided by the surveyed organizations and cultural attendees, researchers
and economists collected extensive wage, labor, tax, and commerce data provided by the U.S. Department of
Commerce (County Business Patterns, the Regional Economic Information System, and the Survey of State and
Local Finance), as well as local and state tax data for use in the input-output analyses.

Why doesn’t this study use a multiplier?
When many people hear about an economic impact study, they expect the result to be quantified in what is often
called a multiplier or an economic activity multiplier. The economic activity multiplier is an estimate of the
number of times a dollar changes hands within the community (e.g., a theater pays its actor, the actor spends
money at the grocery store, the grocery store pays the cashier, and so on). It is quantified as one number by which
expenditures are multiplied. The convenience of the multiplier is that it is one simple number. Users rarely note,
however, that the multiplier is developed by making gross estimates of the industries within the local economy

and does not allow for differences in the characteristics of those industries. Using an economic activity multiplier
usually results in an overestimation of the economic impact and therefore lacks reliability.

Why are the admissions expenses excluded from the analysis of audience spending?
Researchers assume that any admissions dollars paid by event attendees are typically collected as revenue for the
organization that is presenting the event. The organization then spends those dollars. The admissions paid by
audiences are excluded because those dollars are captured in the operating budgets of the participating nonprofit
arts and cultural organizations. This methodology avoids “double-counting” those dollars in the analysis.

How is the economic impact of arts and culture organizations different from
other industries?
Any time money changes hands there is a measurable economic impact. Social service organizations, libraries,
and all entities that spend money have an economic impact. What makes the economic impact of arts and culture
organizations unique is that, unlike most other industries, they induce large amounts of related spending by their
audiences. For example, when patrons attend a performing arts event, they may purchase dinner at a restaurant, eat
dessert after the show, and return home and pay the baby-sitter. These expenditures have a positive and
measurable impact on the economy.

Will my local legislators believe these results?
Yes, this study makes a strong argument to legislators, but you may need to provide them with some extra help. It
will be up to the user of this report to educate the public about economic impact studies in general and the results
of this study in particular. The user may need to explain (1) the study methodology used; (2) that economists
created an input-output model for each community and region in the study; and (3) the difference between inputoutput analysis and a multiplier. The good news is that as the number of economic impact studies completed by
arts organizations and other special interest areas increases, so does the sophistication of community leaders
whose influence these studies are meant to affect. Today, most decision makers want to know what methodology
is being used and how and where the data were gathered.
You can be confident that the input-output analysis used in this study is a highly-regarded model in the field of
economics (the basis of two Nobel Prizes in economics). However, as in any professional field, there is
disagreement about procedures, jargon, and the best way to determine results. Ask 12 artists to define art and you
may get 12 answers; expect the same of economists. You may meet an economist who believes that these studies
should be done differently (for example, a cost-benefit analysis of the arts).

How can a community not participating in the Arts and Economic Prosperity 5
study apply these results?
Because of the variety of communities studied and the rigor with which the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study
was conducted, nonprofit arts and cultural organizations located in communities that were not part of the study can
estimate their local economic impact. Estimates can be derived by using the Arts & Economic Prosperity 5
Calculator (found at www.AmericansForTheArts.org/EconomicImpact). Additionally, users will find sample
PowerPoint presentations, press releases, Op-Ed, and other strategies for proper application of their estimated
economic impact data.

Update on Arts & Economic Prosperity Audience Survey
Cambridge Arts Council
Lauren Shuffleton Drago, 1/3/2017
Outreach
In order to secure events at which Cambridge Arts Council staff could survey for the AEP Study,
Molly and I amassed a list of forty-four eligible organizations in Cambridge. We used the list
used for the organizational survey, and added historic, scientific, and other institutions that met
the requirements for the audience surveying.
In January, Molly announced that this project would be underway and began discussing the
study with organizational leaders at various events. Afterwards, I reached out to organizations
on a one-on-one basis based on whether they had events that seemed like promising surveying
opportunities listed online. Some organizations never responded, but most replied and were
willing to help. A few were particularly enthusiastic about our efforts, which is reflected in the
total number of surveys gathered at these venues.
Results
As of December 31, 2016, we have gathered 803 surveys, three over the 800 required.

IN CITY COUNCIL
September 16, 2019
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS
Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair
Councillor Craig Kelley, Co-Chair
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux
Councillor Alanna Mallon
Mayor Marc C. McGovern
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.
Councillor E. Denise Simmons
Councillor Quinton Zondervan

In City Council July 29, 2019

The Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a
public hearing on June 26, 2019 at 3:35 PM in the Sullivan Chamber.
The purpose of the hearing was to discuss a petition received from Self Storage Group, LLC to
amend the Zoning Ordinance by creating a New Street Overlay District (ATTACHMENT A).
Present at the hearing were Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley, Co-Chairs of the
Committee, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Toomey,
Councillor Zondervan, Director of Zoning and Development Jeff Roberts
and Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk’s Office.
Also present were Attorney James Rafferty, 907 Massachusetts Avenue, co-petitioners of Self
Storage Group, LLC (SSG) David M. Williams, Director of Development, SSG Development
and Construction, 129 South Street, Fourth Floor, Boston and
George A. Bachrach, Principal, David Fulton, Mark Boyes-Watson, architect for the project and
Craig Nicholson, Just-A-Start (JAS).
Councillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing
was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of the hearing: petitioners, staff,
clarifying question session, public comment and the Ordinance Committee will discuss the
petition and come to a conclusion and make a recommendation.
Attorney James Rafferty spoke on behalf of the co-petitioners SSG, the owner of one of the
parcels, and present from SSG is David Williams, George Bachrach and David Fulton. The
architect for project, Mark Boyes Watson, is present. He stated that this is a petition that is being
jointly filed by the owners of two parcels that are contained in the proposed New Street Overlay
District. This is a refiled petition and the original petition did not advance beyond the Ordinance
committee. He stated that with lessons learned from the original petition and feedback received,
the property owner went back and analyzed the entire program. He noted that the overriding
Packet Pg. 407

2.7

message that was heard from the last presentation was the need to create more of an active and
mixed-use environment on New Street. He explained that the prior proposal allowed for an
increase in density and height for this newly created use. The petition creates a new category of
storage. He stated that the current storage is treated with no distinction in the table of uses
between a warehouse that would accommodate all types of truck traffic and uses typically
associated with storage warehouses, versus self-storage which is a consumer-oriented
establishment. He stated that the representatives from SSG can tell more about self-storage
which has a number of benefits and attributes that are stabilizing forces in residential
communities. He stated that this is the goal sought by the proponents that believe that this
location will benefit greatly from the type of business that they provide.
From a zoning perspective Rafferty said there are three changes to the petition that are
noteworthy. He stated that the first change is the criteria that would be imposed on any
application for a special permit to allow for additional height and would not include a
requirement affordable housing. He noted that there was no housing proposed in the prior
petition. He continued that the petition in its current form in Section 20.95.1 (1) The first criteria
talks about a minimum of 8,000 square feet of affordable housing. The proponents have
modified and will show a plan to include 20,000 square feet of affordable housing and petitioners
are pleased to report that they have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with JustA-Start (JAS). Attorney Rafferty announced that Mr. Nicholson from JAS is here to discuss this
joint venture agreement that they intend to pursue where JAS experience, expertise and
knowledge in affordable housing will be put to good use here. He stated that JAS will own and
control this affordable housing. He added that the design of the housing has become a critical
aspect of mitigating the impact of the building. The architect will demonstrate how the housing
use at this site can be compatible and can serve as a softening of the building edge as it
approaches the street.
He stated that the other notable amendment that would be sought by the applicant would involve
the height dimension. This is in Section 20.96 and the language of the petition states that the
maximum height for the petition could be 65 feet. They are proposing an amendment that there
would be a bulk plane requirement, a requirement that exists in many zonings and overlay
districts in the City. He explained that at the 55-foot height the building on all four sides will
have to step back at a 45-degree angle from 55 to 65 feet. He stated that this has the effect of
reducing the mass of the building both as the building is seen on New Street and from Danehy
Park. He noted that these are the two substantive changes.
Rafferty stated that the third component of petition that there is an area of 2,500 square feet
devoted to retail use. He noted that the intention is for the Evolve Gym to have a facility. He
stated that Mr. Bachrach can go through the details of the arrangements. The Evolve Gym is
now a tenant at will and their lease expired at the end of December 2018 and the owner of the
building is fully intent on selling the building. He noted that it has been a case that the Evolve
Gym’s long-term use at the site is very limited. He explained that an arrangement has been made
that the proponents will build out a space for Evolve at a size that will work for the gym,
although it is a different size. He stated that the size was the subject of negotiations with Evolve
and the rental rate for the space will be a below market rate in an effort to keep this component
an active use in the building. The hope is that Evolve will remain for a long time. The scaling
back of the proposed height and the introduction of the gym are two of the changes.

Rafferty stated that the Planning Board’s presentation did not include the bulk plane restrictions
nor the increase in the amount of affordable housing. He noted that there are components of the
petition that are very different than what the Planning Board evaluated.
He stated that Mr. Boyes-Watson will present some visual elements of this presentation that
would turn the text of the petition into an understanding of what can be built at the site. He
commented that it has been an effective collaboration with Mr. Boyes-Watson and JAS on how
to optimize housing at this location, creating the type of unit size that would be most affected.
He spoke about the obvious adjacency to a large recreational facility, walking distance to an
elementary school makes this a very attractive housing location for families and the fact that
there are residential uses emerging on the other side of New Street. He addressed the comment
about why the overlay district only encompasses one side of the street. He responded that this is
a function of reality. The other side of the street has an existing residential building already
underway and it did not make sense to include those parcels in the overlay district because it was
unlikely to see much change in those buildings. He stated that the other element of the petition
that is new to the petition addresses a consistent theme with the Envision Planning in the Alewife
Area. He stated that the idea to find locations in emerging mixed-use districts within Alewife
where additional housing could be permitted. He stated that the petition does contain language
that Mr. Markarian (owner of adjacent site) or his successor to be motivated to convert the
automotive and the light industrial uses to housing. This is to incentivize housing on this side of
New Street. He stated that regarding the site presentation there is an opportunity to make the
connection on land owned by the petitioner to the back end of Danehy Park. At this time Mr.
Boyes-Watson gave his presentation.
Mark Boyes-Watson, architect, spoke about the overarching urban design of the overlay by
viewing slides, including existing conditions and some of the proposed streetscape design, to see
if New Street can with the change in zoning become what it seems to want to become, which is
more of a housing street and less a street of a strange mixture of uses that it is today. He stated
that with the changes New Street can become a mixture of housing. He gave a presentation
(ATTACHMENT B) of the overall building that incorporates housing along New Street, which
is accessible on the ground floor. One of the slides begins to show the relationship is of the
housing to the storage building. He stated that there is a planted setback on the New Street level
before Danehy Park rises. The building is raised out of the ground because it is in a flood zone.
He spoke about the bulk plane setting the top story back and it is more than a 45-degree bulk
control plane on New Street. He stated that the top floor of the storage building starts 40 feet
back and the public will not be aware of the upper top story when on New Street.
He stated that the parking is concealed inside the building. This parking is also for the housing
and gym. He noted that the storage space is a low traffic generation and does not require
parking; it is used intermittently and there is a modest loading zone. The gym has windows that
look out onto Danehy Park.
There is a proposed bike and pedestrian pathway. Watson spoke about a storage facility for
sports equipment because there is a shortage of storage at Danehy Park. This is accessed off the
pedestrian pathway. He stated that the housing is used as the primary street frontage for New
Street. He stated that the storage facility has a green wall design and a gallery of windows
overlooking Danehy Park and the upper setback story of the storage facility is setback 45 feet.
He stated that additional plant material will be introduced on the site. He stated that there are
existing trees along the border and on the park edge. He stated that a robust row of trees will be
planted down the property line. He explained that the intention of this building is to get to Net
Packet Pg. 409

2.7

Zero and the storage area is energy efficient. He stated that combining the large roof and the
well-designed envelope it is expected that this building can be both the equivalent of LEED Gold
and Net Zero.
The proposed building is creating a more consistent urban form down this side of New Street as
is the HRI building (now under construction) that overlooks Fresh Pond. He stated that the
creation of these units of affordable housing is an appropriate urban design response to this
location. He spoke about the traffic at the site. He stated that the self-storage use is one of the
lowest traffic generators. He stated that the 2070 compliance is for the flood and storm water
requirements and currently the site tends to flood but a storage infiltration system can be
designed that sits under the parking level to deal with this. The site can be designed to mitigate
environmental conditions and this is a great advantage.
Craig Nicholson, JAS, stated that JAS was approached by SSG to work with them on the
affordable housing component for this site. JAS entered into a MOU and upon this project going
forward JAS would be in a position to take over the housing component, own it, keep it
permanently affordable, manage it and maintain it in the same fashion as JAS does for the rest of
its portfolio. He commented that the inclusion of affordable housing in the project is a creative
way to take something that could just become a commercial component and have some
inclusionary money sent into the trust fund. Hopefully it would get used in the right place and
right time, but put it into a situation where housing definitely gets built and by having it be a
mixed used building where the entire front of the building is housing there is no possibility that
there will be only a storage structure without housing up front. This is unique and a way to
ideally and ultimately create affordable housing at less cost than if it were an open market
transaction. He added that JAS is excited to partner with SSG on this.
He stated that a 20,000 square foot building would yield approximately 20 units, but in this
scenario, we are looking for less than 20 units because the goal is predominantly family size
units. He outlined the units as 20% of the units would be 3-bedroom units and 60% of the units
would be 2-bedroom units and on the affordability level would be looking for more of a
moderate affordability at 80%. He spoke about the typical family size that occupies a 1, 2- or 3bedroom units, which would bring families into this neighborhood next to Danehy Park with the
moderate affordability at the 80% AMI. This is very difficult to achieve in Cambridge. He stated
that a lot of the programs for new construction for affordable housing requires tax credits, which
puts this tier significantly lower and creates a gap in the middle. He noted that this unique
situation where housing can be created without the same overly heavily subsidized tax credit
type of approach creates a moderate tier for ideally working families within Cambridge is
something that JAS is excited to be a part of.
Mr. Bachrach stated that he is proud of the work being done with JAS and the efforts to
accommodate the gym. He stated that much was learned at the Planning Board hearing which
did not go well and as a result significant changes were made to the design to reduce the height,
allow setbacks so that you are looking at four-story building from the front of the building. He
stated that the self-storage business is nothing more than a neighborhood closet. He stated that
75% of customers are residential and 25% of customers are small businesses and all from the
immediate neighborhood. He stated that this industry helps to stabilize neighborhoods. He
spoke about small businesses that run out of storage space and cannot afford to rent larger space
at $30 a square foot in Cambridge so they come to the storage space at $2 a square foot to offload their back-office inventory or record keeping and are able to stay in the neighborhood. He

Packet Pg. 410

2.7

cited other examples where storage space is needed. He stated that this is a local amenity with
low traffic and uses less water than a single-family home.
He stated that in terms of the public benefits if approved the project would provide storage space
for families in transition who are at risk of losing their possessions, storage space for athletic
equipment used at Danehy Park and the pedestrian and bike path along the Danehy Park side of
the building. He stated that he is proud of the proposed rooftop solar field, which will the largest
private solar field in the City. He stated that he hopes to do more as time goes by with more
community input into this process which is only at the early stage. He expects to get more input
if given the opportunity to proceed.
Councillor Carlone asked if there are any clarifying questions.
Councillor Zondervan stated that storage does not require parking, just the loading. He asked if
all the parking is for the housing and the gym. Mr. Williams stated that the storage does need a
little parking. He added that most of the activity happens in the loading area. He stated that
when a customer comes to a storage facility they park, go into the office and arrange for a
contract and when they go to use the storage facility by either taking possessions in or out of the
storage unit they park in the loading area and go in and out; there is a low parking need for this
type of building. Councillor Zondervan asked could there be less parking. Mr. Williams said
this parking will support the housing, the gym and the storage. He stated that there is an
allowance of 5-7 spaces for the gym and 7-8 spaces for the 15 units of housing for a total of 20
parking spaces in the parking field.
Attorney Rafferty said the petition proposes that the parking requirement for dwelling units be
reduced from the current l in the district to .75 so the residential parking is being scaled back.
He explained that Mr. Nicholson has stated throughout his portfolio there are many households
without cars. Councillor Zondervan commented that he is in favor of reducing this to zero. He
asked if this can be constructed in such a way that the parking can be reclaimed in the future if it
is determined that the parking is not needed. Mr. Williams responded in the affirmative.
Councillor Zondervan asked if there is another floor above and referenced slide 7. Mr. Williams
stated that this is showing a typical upper floor. This floor plan would be for floors 2, 3 and 4 of
the housing and storage. The fifth-floor storage would be a smaller footprint because it is set
back.
Councillor Zondervan stated that on slide 9 he questioned LEED Gold and Net Zero and stated
that this felt tentative. Mr. Boyes-Watson spoke of the design being changed and the roof
shrinking. He noted that the housing does use more energy than the storage facility. He stated
that he was trying not to over promise. Mr. Williams stated that on the original design from last
year calculations were done and they were able to get the storage building at the Net Zero
classification. He noted that the design has evolved with input and the roof for the self-storage
has shrunk with the inclusion of the housing. He stated that all the calculations have not been
finished with the modified design. He stated that he felt confident that they can get a large solar
field on the fourth floor of the roof and parts of the fifth floor of the roof and the housing has not
been analyzed to see how a component could work with this. He stated that this goal is
important to the petitioners. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS tries to make all their buildings
energy efficient for lower long-term maintenance. Lower operating costs are critical to maintain
reduced rents so a highly efficient envelope, lower energy consumption and LEED is what is
being strived for. He stated that JAS will make this as efficient as possible and get to Net Zero
Packet Pg. 411

2.7

and LEED Gold. Councillor Zondervan suggested considering making it Net Zero Ready
because Net Zero is not a design standard. Net Zero cannot be verified until it is operating but if
it is made Net Zero Ready will enable getting to Net Zero practice.
Councillor Zondervan spoke about slide 11 and wanted more detail on what is envisioned for the
multi-use path and what will it be used for; how wide it is and is it just a bike path or is it truly a
multi-use path. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that it is a five-foot path by the side of the building.
There is a wide unused berm, which is part of the Danehy Park design. What is being shown on
the slide is that the berm will be an amenity; the petition will provide a five-foot pathway. He
stated that there is a bigger opportunity here that is beyond the scope of this overlay and as a
landscape architect he would be thinking creatively whether there can be more uses for the berm.
Councillor Zondervan commented that five feet is not enough and wanted more work on this
aspect.
Councillor Zondervan moved to slide 12. He asked if the stormwater can be captured and reused
the same way as is done on the King School on Putnam Avenue. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded
in the affirmative. He spoke about irrigation requirements and would definitely look toward
doing this. Councillor Zondervan stated that on slide 14 regarding the parking, he noted that
there were concerns raised at the Planning Board about making sure that the parking is secure for
the affordable housing tenants. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that there is nothing about the way the
parking is designed that would not allow some type of gated access as long as it is compatible
and further stated that because this is a mixed-use building accessibility is needed for the users of
the gym and housing. Mr. Williams stated that one of the components of the self-storage
business is secure and there are sixteen security cameras on site constantly surveilling; there is a
record of all who enters or exists the site. Councillor Zondervan suggested a garage door that
closed at midnight and some type of gated access. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is no gated
parking at any JAS sites; there are security cameras; proper lighting and make it inhospitable for
anyone to lurk.
Councillor Mallon asked for clarification on the AMI. She asked is it a minimum of 80% AMI
for all the units. Mr. Nicholson responded that it is the maximum. Councillor Mallon asked did
JAS look at this parcel when it was available for sale for affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson
responded in the affirmative, but it was under agreement with SSG. He stated that an initial
cursory look was done on the property. He stated that obviously with the full site there would be
more affordable housing but would have to be fully born by the subsidies and rents by the
housing. He stated that the request for the City and Affordable Housing Trust would have been
more on a per unit basis than in a situation like this. He stated that regarding the timing it would
take several years to get underway and to break ground. He stated that based on the scarcity of
resources and process that needs to be undertaken with the state to get these resources granted to
a project. Councillor Mallon commented that there is sentiment to have the whole site for
affordable housing.
She asked if the traffic generation is the same as last year and will there be more traffic with the
15 units of housing. Mr. Williams responded that the traffic study has not been updated with the
plan redesign. Councillor Mallon asked if the art mural wall was lost, which was on the original
proposal. Mr. Bachrach stated that he is open to have an art wall and will be happy to work with
the Arts Council. Councillor Mallon wanted the benefits for sports storage and family in
transitions and asked why this is not listed on the public benefits. Mr. Bachrach stated that the
focus is on the overlay district. He stated that he is committed to the public benefits as listed in
the past and including the art wall, storage for sport facilities and families in transition. He
Packet Pg. 412

2.7

proposed a green wall and if this petition goes forward this will be left up to the City on whether
it wants a green wall or an art wall. Attorney Rafferty stated that in the petition in section
20.95.1 spells out the criteria for the Planning Board to evaluate an application for a special
permit. He noted that # 2 is public benefits that will enhance the use of the adjoining Danehy
Park. This was a way to capture this concept without specifically doing so. He stated that this
could be subject to amendment. He stated that specifically number 4 goes to the provisions for
affordable short-term storage. He commented that this has not fallen out of the petition. This
was in the prior petition and is in this petition explicitly as criteria necessary to grant a special
permit.
Vice Mayor Devereux asked what the total GFA is of this building that is available under the
zoning. She noted that this is a substantial up zoning. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the
components of project as drawn is just over 110,000 square feet of storage; 20,000 square feet of
housing and 2,500 square foot for the gym. He stated that the parking for the housing is exempt
but because of the flood plain all the housing would be exempt. Vice Mayor Devereux asked if
the vision of the zoning goes lot line to lot line. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the building has
setbacks on all sides. He stated that the illustrations show a building setback 5 feet everywhere
with 10 feet on New Street in addition to the other bulk plane controls. Vice Mayor Devereux
commented on a discrepancy that she sees in terms of this area described as unused park land
along Danehy Park side shown on slide five. She stated that what is shown is a grassy lawn with
some trees, but this is fenced off because it is a methane trench and it not open to the public. Mr.
Watson stated that where the line of trees along the path is about 2 feet from the property line.
Vice Mayor Devereux repeated that the other area does not exist; it is a methane trench and is
fenced off for health and environment reasons. This path is not a realistic benefit unless the
petitioner is going to give more of his land to create a desirable path. Attorney Rafferty stated
that the path and its location was provided to the petitioners by the Envision Study. He stated
that the location of the path in that area and image in the presentation shows the path was not a
creation of the petitioners. He noted that this is the desired connection from the Envision Study.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the path needs to be created on the land of this site because the
public land is not available for a path. Gym windows will be looking at an embankment of the
park and will not be looking at Danehy Park.
Councillor Kelley stated that this is a big ask for both height and FAR beyond what is allowed in
current zoning. Attorney Rafferty stated that the current FAR would yield a building one-half the
size of the proposed storage building. He stated that the petition is looking to increase the FAR
to 3.0 and the current FAR is 1.25. This would not allow the 20,000 square feet of housing,
which over and above the increased FAR permitted for the commercial building. This is 20,000
on housing side and on the storage side the square footage increase. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated
that this calculation has not been done because there would be a bonus for the affordable
component. He stated that if the site is 43,000 square feet the increase in GFA is worth 50,000.
Councillor Kelley noted that this is a big thing for this area.
Councillor Siddiqui asked why they chose 15 housing units and if they had similar joint venture
partnership in the portfolio before. Mr. Nicholson looked at joint ventures for developments but
nothing as concrete as this proposal. He stated SSG decided to increase the housing and the 15
units is a factor in increasing the number for family sized units. Councillor Siddiqui asked if
there is a mixed-used self-storage. Mr. Bacharach responded that he unaware of any-mixed use
storage has been done anywhere in the country. He stated that he has done projects that included
other uses. He spoke about a current project in Jamaica Plains where the City asked to have built

Packet Pg. 413

2.7

a housing complex adjacent to the storage building he is building. A common parking lot is
shared.
Councillor Carlone asked what the GFA storage size is. Mr. Boyes-Watson said 110,000 square
feet. Councillor Carlone asked Mr. Nicholson about the statement that this is an unusual deal
from an affordable housing perspective. He asked what the deal is. He asked if JAS is seeking
funds to compliment what is being offered. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS would act as a
development consultant during the process and upon completion of the units JAS would
purchase the units as a turnkey situation. He stated that JAS investment is time and a lump sum
purchase of a finished project. He stated that in terms of cost he does not have the numbers and
cannot say what levels of funding will be needed. The funding will involve a standard mortgage
which the property would pay. He spoke about state subsidies that would be applied for. He
stated that depending on the final numbers and through the City through the Affordable Housing
Trust acted as a gap filler for this type of thing. He added in this scenario he does not know what
the gap would be. Councillor Carlone stated that new unit locations could cost $100,000 $200,000 per unit for the land and is there a benefit other than turnkey on a financial basis or a
land value. Mr. Nicholson responded that a land value is being discussed but was not negotiated
yet. The land value is significantly less than $100,000 - $200,000 per unit. Councillor Carlone
noted that there needs to be a financial investment from both sides.
Councillor Carlone asked Mr. Roberts to come forward and discuss the Planning Board’s
comments.
Mr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board heard the current petition on June 4, 2019 and the
original petition was not heard by the Planning Board last year due to scheduling complications.
The Planning Board voted not to recommend the petition. He explained that the Planning Board
had no concern with the self-storage as a use but had concerns conceptually. He stated that the
Planning Board was receptive to some of the petitioner’s descriptions of how this kind of use can
work in a complimentary fashion to residential uses. He stated that the concerns of the Planning
Board were with the notion of whether there should be such different treatment for self-storage
uses on this particular site, rather than having criteria and standards for self-storage uses in all
similarly zone districts of the City.
He stated that another Planning Board concern for this particular overlay district was about the
overall commercial development scale that was being proposed and the impact it would have in
an area that has begun to transition significantly from commercial to residential character. He
stated that the Planning Board did hear the proposal with the additional affordable housing units
and felt that this was an improvement to the proposal and going in the right direction. He noted
that the petitioners did not assess the bulk control plane that was introduced in the interim but
ultimately the Planning Board still felt that there were concerns about the overall scale in relation
to surrounding areas such as the adjacent residential sites and Danehy Park and the impact.
He stated that from a site-specific point of view there were more concerns about project review
concerning the path proposed along the side. The Planning Board wondered what the character
and feel of the path would be considering it is in a low point of the park and the proposed selfstorage use generating minimum activation in this area. Mr. Roberts noted that the Planning
Board appreciated the suggestions in the petition about retail space on the ground floor would
help to serve the continuation of the gym use on the site and that the adjacent site where this
building is proposed could in the future be developed into housing in a way that will help to
further visually screen the storage site but given the uncertainty of retail tenancy on a long-term
Packet Pg. 414

2.7

basis as well as the uncertainty about what could actually happen on the adjacent site the
Planning Board felt that it was hard to come to a conclusion based on these factors. He stated
that this was the overall impression of the Planning Board.
He added that some Planning Board members noted that if this were to move forward that there
are provisions in the language that the Planning Board suggested should be reviewed more
carefully to make sure that the expectation and criteria are clear and consistent with other parts of
the zoning ordinance which is recommended for any zoning proposal.
Councillor Mallon asked about the Planning Board’s concerns about the path and the low
activation and asked if the board felt that this would be unsafe. Mr. Roberts stated that this was
part of the concern. He stated that the overall impression of the pathway that on one side would
have a building with a self-storage use with no windows, except on the residential side, and
would have uses with no windows looking down onto the path and then on the other side is the
methane trench with the hill going up to the taller part of Danehy Park may feel like a closed off
space. Ultimately it may be a space where individuals would feel uncomfortable being there.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the Planning Board unanimously voted not to forward this
petition with an unfavorable recommendation. She stated that Ted Cohen felt it was close to spot
zoning without any good planning rationale. Mr. Cohen noted that the environmental features
are things that are currently required or will be soon. She added that Steve Cohen wondered why
when the City is trying to incentivize housing, when it is already the emerging use and noted in
Envision, why go in the other direction to up zone for a non-residential use. She stated that the
City Council is being asked to change the zoning but this seems like it is going in the wrong
direction. She stated that Mr. Bacci has questions related to security and how the storage would
be used, and traffic was understated for the storage uses. She added that another Planning Board
member commented on the blank tall wall looming over Danehy Park and Mr. Russell noted that
the 65 feet would be overwhelming on the soccer field and had questions on the wording of the
zoning petition. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the Chair of the Planning Board was
uncomfortable with the spot zoning and she felt that is one cannot tell if you are reviewing a
project or zoning this is not in a good place. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that the City
Council is not in a good place with this petition in terms of what it is trying to do from a
planning standpoint.
She noted that the Planning Board is being asked repeatedly to approve up zoning and they
commented at one of their meetings that the Board felt they were getting out of planning because
everything was being negotiated on a parcel by parcel basis with potential community benefits
that were often subject to letters of agreement or political negotiations in this City Council rather
than with them. She stated that she is not comfortable doing planning this way. She spoke about
the other parcel and the co-petitioner is a larger parcel than this one and do not know what this
zoning would do for this owner and his intentions to redevelop this parcel. She stated that if this
was being zoned for self-storage at a greater density the City should not be unhappy if he decides
that a self-storage building is profitable and builds a large storage building and throw in housing.
This would result in a large portion of New Street where it meets Bay State Road. She noted
what has not been mentioned is that both lots back up onto Bay State Road that may one day
want to be redeveloped but are not up zoned and currently some are residential at a low scale.
She added from a planning standpoint why would the City Council do this and in particularly
when the Planning Board has unanimously advised that they would not.

Packet Pg. 415

2.7

Councillor Carlone noted that the scheme has changed somewhat but may not satisfy issues such
as the green wall and setback and windows at the top.
Councillor Kelley stated that he was confused with the establishment of the housing here impacts
what would normally be paid into the linkage fee or does it. Mr. Roberts stated that the incentive
zoning requirement would apply to commercial and non-residential uses above a certain size of
development; 35,000 square feet or more. The commercial component has a per square foot
contribution which goes to the Affordable Housing Trust and this is no provision and would not
translate into a payment for these particular units. He noted that this would be a separate
payment to the Affordable Housing Trust and would be under a separate agreement.
Councillor Carlone opened the hearing to public comment. No one signed up for public
comment.
Councillor Zondervan asked what the term lease is for the Evolve gym. Mr. Williams stated that
in the letter of intent with Evolve it is a 10-year term with 2 five-year renewal options.
Councillor Zondervan asked who is paying for housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that the ultimate
cost of housing will be dependent on the cost to build it. He stated that the price for the land is
significantly reduced which is a benefit. He believed that the incentive zoning fee gets paid into
the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that as the Affordable Housing Trust is the typical gap
filler for affordable housing projects in Cambridge and construction costs are still high with the
reduced land what this gap will be needs to be filled. He stated that his estimation is that it will
be significantly less that the gap that needs to be filled in a standard project. Councillor
Zondervan asked what the land value contribution is. Mr. Nicholson stated that no final
conclusion has been reached. He stated that he would like to look at the overall costs and see
what exactly it must be from his perspective to make it all work out and make it a true benefit to
the City. Councillor Zondervan stated that it is important for the City Council to know this
because the only reason to approve this project is because it comes with affordable housing and
if it did not the City Council would not approve this. He added that it is important for the City
Council to understand this and what the City is getting. He added that if all that is happening
here is that that affordable housing is being built under normal circumstances then the only real
housing contribution is the land value which sounds like it is a discount and not be full value of
the land. He stated that he wanted to know what this is. Mr. Nicholson then stated that this is
more than a 50% discount on the land and considerably more.
Mr. Nicholson spoke about deals lost above the $200,000 per unit range. He stated that they
have discussed a land price but if this continues to be lowered to make sure the deal works and
provides the benefit that the petitioners are trying to commit to then the price of the land will
continue to drop to ensure that the deal works. Councillor Zondervan noted that self-storage is
not an ideal use in this neighborhood. He commended the developer for making sure that the
gym can stay open. The partnership with JAS is significant; 15 units of affordable housing is
significant. He added that more housing could be built on this site if there was no storage. He
spoke about the other community benefits of the storage for transition families, sports storage
and net zero building particularly if it includes housing. He noted that there is no true Net Zero
housing in Cambridge yet. He stated that he understands and shares the concerns of the Planning
Board because this is a massive up zoning and is very concerning but the developer has gone
above and beyond and has set a high bar for the kind of up zoning that the City Council ought to
consider. He is ready to support the project but wanted 3 items clearly specified in the zoning or
the commitment letter to include:

Packet Pg. 416

2.7

That the entire building should be built to a Net Zero Ready standard;
Retail space to continue to be retail or some other community space; no banks and no
additional storage in the space; and
A 5 feet path is not wide enough and wanted assurances that this will be top notch
community path and that it would be a true benefit to the community.
He stated that other up zoning projects in the City provide little community benefit to the City
and are not providing affordable housing. He added that this project is very different for these
reasons.
Councillor Kelley stated that he shares Vice Mayor Devereux’s concerns. He noted that he does
not know what is being negotiated at this point. He stated that this is what the City Council
seems to be doing a lot of. He shares the Planning Board concerns on doing one offs on specific
things on a regular basis. He added Cambridge can buy and build its own sports storage for
youth. He stated that he felt that the City Council is negotiating too much little stuff. He stated
that he is concerned about how this continuously goes.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the path is a huge distraction. She stated that their land ends in
the back yards of existing buildings on Bay State Road. There is no benefit to a path going from
a part of Danehy Park that is not used and does not go anywhere; there is not connection that
anyone is asking for and the security risks are real. She asked if the site has been evaluated
under the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay by JAS. She stated that there could be a bigger
building that could be entirely housing under the AHO. This building could be 80 feet tall and
have many units and could continue to have a 2,500 square foot active studio gym. She
commented that the current gym is 18,000 square feet and has child care and multi-class rooms.
The proposal is a workout space but to call it a gym is a misnomer. Evolve gym users depending
on the parking and this is not a transit friendly location; it is a car dominated area and reducing
parking does not help this. She stated that if this an attractive area for housing she asked why the
City is settling for 15 units of housing and the City is still contributing funds to this and is
enabling this. She stated that the cost is too high on the rest of the planning goals and the
surrounding neighborhoods. She urged the owner to come up with a better housing proposal for
this site that is next to the park and is family friendly and environmentally sustainable.
Councillor Mallon spoke about the Pizzuto family, the former owner, who went to the selfstorage group because they wanted a low impact, low traffic for this street. She noted that this is
a major concern in this area about the traffic in this area. She noted that this began with a low
impact traffic goal. She shared the Planning Board concerns about spot zoning, the parcel next
door and what happens with this. Councillor Mallon stated that asking JAS to build 100%
affordable housing for this site was not feasible based on timing and the finances needed. She
stated that suggesting that this could be building under AHO, which has not been passed yet and
may not happen. She commented that the land value is significant, and JAS has come before the
City Council many times informing the City Council about how they were unable to bid on
property because of the land price and the cost of building housing. This offers an opportunity to
build affordable housing quickly. She stated that keeping Evolve, 15 units of affordable housing
and low impact traffic on a s street which is being built up with residential housing and having
commercial and residential on the same site that will keep the traffic low makes this project
appealing. She expressed her gratitude to the petitioners for their work to make this project
supportable. She stated that she is struggling with this. She asked Mr. Nicholson if it is possible
under the AHO could this be 100% affordable housing in the future.

Packet Pg. 417

2.7

Mr. Nicholson stated that there could be a mechanism where that site becomes all housing but
whether it would be all affordable housing or mixed income housing similar to the HRI project
on Concord Avenue is hard to say at this point. He stated that the numbers were run 1.5 years
ago, and they have not been run under the potential of the overlay zoning. He stated that this is
an expensive project. It would involve 9% and 4% tax credits as well as a significant subsidy
from the state and the City. He explained that 9% credits are very competitive and may take 2-3
years for this to be approved. He added that the process of entitling it under 40B involves a
potential for various appeals and lawsuits associated with this because it would not be a by-right
type of building in terms of parking ratio and setbacks looking to maximize the space. These are
the difficult things that JAS does all the time, but it is not quick, and he cannot guarantee this,
and it is not simple. This site can be all housing but will likely not be all affordable housing.
Councillor Mallon noted that there would have to be 75 units to get the amount needed for the
incentive zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the HRI project on Concord Avenue it was
stated that it was 98 units of affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is mid-market
component and there is a market rate component. He stated that there is a middle market that is
outside of the standard structure and he thought that there was a market rate component. He
explained how the 9% tax credits work. He stated that there is a sweet spot at about 45 units.
Once above this the 9% tax credits are maxed out that can be applied to the building. Then you
start with the 4% tax credit tier and this is about 3.25% and this is one-third of all the tax credits
beyond this which means that this requires more subsidy. He explained that this is offset by
having higher rents that the tax credits allow. Councillor Carlone added of the 98 units, 10 units
are middle-income units. Councillor Mallon stated that the CDD’s website states it is 98 units
and all units will be affordable.
Councillor Siddiqui asked what is the public purpose to provide this type of use that has not been
recognized. The petition has changed since June 4th and it does not feel as well thought out as it
should or could be. She stated that to negotiate this way is difficult.
Councillor Carlone announced that the petitioners would like this to be moved forward because
of a purchase and sale agreement.
Councillor Carlone stated that understanding the value of the affordable housing investment
by petitioner is key. He noted that having access to land is a good thing. He stated that he
would rather the gym space be a Pre-Kindergarten space, which is sorely lacking in
Cambridge. He wanted this to be a true public benefit and understand the value of affordable
housing investment. The impact of the project has been minimized by the design of project and
the programming. He agreed that there are issues with the path, but the path was what Envision
put on the site knowing that the methane was on this site. He stated that taking out the path will
add more green. He stated that architecturally there are things that could minimize the massing.
The set back on the roof with the top floor instead of being vertical could be treated like a roof
on an angle so that the bulk plane is actually a metal roof instead of a metal facade which would
make the appearance feel less overwhelming. He stated that most people would experience this
from the soccer field which would reduce the overall building to about 30 feet. He commented
that the solution from the street is good. The value of affordable housing investment has to be
known for him to fully understand. He applauded the effort on the petition by the petitioners.
Mr. Nicholson spoke about the value of affordable housing. The land price is in the area of
$50,000 per unit; this is a significant discount. He spoke about how the construction costs would
be dealt with. He noted that the foundation, parking, and the podium that’s the housing will be
Packet Pg. 418

sitting on will be done by developer and there remove those costs. Only the stick-built
component of the actual unit is what JAS would be buying. He stated that this is $2.5-$3 million
of benefit and reduced cost for the affordable housing. He spoke about not having to do site
work, podium, steel construction on this level is a significant discount on a per square foot price
from overall construction. Councillor Carlone stated that this information needs to be
formalized.
Councillor Kelley stated that he would feel better if someone with more knowledge about
housing construction and affordable housing policy come to the City Council and state that this
is a good deal. He commented that the proponents are good people and are proposing to do
something that will be a big deal for them and it may be a great deal for the City of Cambridge.
He stated that if we are going to do this we should be up front about the fact that whatever is
done is a negotiating process. He stated that the zoning should not stay as it was written decades
ago especially in a world that is evolving fast. He resents making judgments based on the money
being saved per unit given the cost of the site and adding to this confusion about the placement
of the path and the use of the path is troubling. He stated that this is not a comfortable discussion
for him.
Councillor Zondervan stated that he is uncomfortable to negotiate with so little information. He
suggested moving this forward without a recommendation and this will be before the City
Council at the July 29th meeting and it will give petitioners time to address the concerns of the
Ordinance Committee and provide information requested. This provides the City Council with
the opportunity to fully weigh the cost and benefits of this project. He commented that as
difficult it is for his colleagues to say yes to this project; it would also be difficult to say no to 15
units of affordable housing (20,000 square feet of affordable housing) because they are family
units. He added that it is difficult for him to say to the first truly Net Zero project in Cambridge.
He stated that he would like to see the whole site be affordable housing but short of the City
Council rezoning this it cannot be guaranteed.
Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the City Council is perfectly willing to rezone for developers
and cannot see why not rezone for the City. She stated that with the current FAR at 1.25 there
could be 55,000 square feet of storage would be allowed on this size lot and with this petition it
is being doubled at 110,000 square feet. She felt that there could be more housing. She
commented that 20,000 square feet is a small amount of the total square footage. She stated that
they are getting a bonus. She stated that she does not know what commercially viable is as
stated in the petition. The City Council is up-zoning something without enough information.
She asked the Clerk to outline the procedural aspect of the petition in relation to the summer
meeting. In response to the question by Vice Mayor Devereux, Ms. Lopez stated that the
Committee Report would be on the agenda for the July 29th City Council Meeting. She stated
that the decision of what to do with this petition is up to the City Council. This could be passed
to a second reading at the July 29th meeting and then there is time from the July 29th meeting to
September 24 to further negotiate or discuss more with the petitioner before ordination.
Councillor Kelley spoke about a zoning petition to up zone the quadrangle and there will be
benefits associated with this and there may be benefits associated with other zoning proposal as
well. He stated that this is the way that business is done but he would like to know that the City
Council is confident if this gets passed that the hardest and best bargain has been received on
behalf of the City.

Attorney Rafferty stated that the petitioners are willing to provide the information requested by
the City Council and to work further on the MOU with JAS. He stated that the calendar reality is
that if the petition does not leave the Ordinance Committee in time for the opportunity to be on
the July 29th agenda the petition would run out of time to do the substantive work. He stated
that hearing the concerns expressed, particularly on the path, the petitioners will go back to CDD
to discuss the benefits of the path. Other than the width there may be other short comings with
the path that will make it not viable. He noted that there is time between now and the July 29th
meeting and between the July 29th meeting and the expiration date of the petition. He noted that
if this is not referred to City Council for July 29th Special City Council meeting there will be no
time for further discussion about this opportunity. He stated that the one consensus he is hearing
from the City Council is that this does represent an opportunity and if this is an opportunity
worth exploring the petitioners would welcome the chance to continue to work with the staff to
provide the details needed to get the City Council in a position of knowledge, particularly on the
cost of construction. He stated that with the presence of JAS there is experience with building
housing. He stated that there is credibility and a track record that can be built upon with
providing the City Council with additional information.
Councillor Kelley moved to refer the petition to the full City Council without a
recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote six members. Vice Mayor Devereux was
recorded in negative.
Councillor Carlone stated that information is being requested to further understand the value that
is being generated that JAS or another non-profit will be able to count on. He requested more
understanding on architecture and quality of finishes so that it is a positive addition to the street.
Vice Mayor Devereux regarding the renderings wanted to see views not from above but from all
side and there will be blank walls that are facing Bay State Road. Councillor Carlone
commented that if this use is going to be it has to be a positive on all sides.
Vice Mayor Devereux noted that the Planning Board mentioned that the language in the petition
was unclear. She made the following motion:
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the
Community Development Department to revise the language in the
New Street Overlay petition and to include in the revision the
following changes:
20.95.1 (1) by striking out 8,000 and inserting 20,000 square feet;
20.94.1 and 20.96.1 entitled Maximum Height be amended by adding
at the end the words “provided, however that no building shall exceed
55 feet without complying with a 45-degree bulk plain.”
The question now came on the motion and the motion carried on a voice vote of seven members.
The following communication was received and made part of the report.
Robin Bonner, 15 Corporal Burns Road, urging the Ordinance Committee not to approve the
petition (ATTACHMENT C).
Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.

Planning Board;
the criteria for approval of a special permit would include requirements that the development will contain at
least 20,000 square feet (amended from 8,000 square feet in the original petition) of gross floor area of
affordable housing subject to Inclusionary Housing provisions, will provide public benefits that will enhance and
benefit the use of the adjoining Danehy Park, will contain sustainability elements such as solar energy systems,
stormwater management controls, and net zero energy standards, and will provide for affordable short-term
storage for low income households;
base zoning limitations for residential uses in the New Street Overlay District would be modified to permit a
maximum height of 65 feet (amended from the original petition to require a 45-degree bulk control plane for any
building exceeding 55 feet in height), gross floor area of 3.0, Lot Area per Dwelling Unit of 300sf, and parking
requirements of .75 per residential unit and .5 for affordable dwelling units;

Calendar Item # 8
IN CITY COUNCIL

September 16, 2019
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

In March of 2014, the License Commission refused to allow UpperWest to open at its
original location at 1001 Massachusetts Avenue, despite having required UpperWest to
invest money to build the space prior to applying for the liquor license, apparently in
order to protect a neighboring bar from competition; and

WHEREAS:

The owners of UpperWest, located at 1 Cedar Street, were issued a five-day liquor
license suspension by the License Commission at a November 7, 2018 hearing, over
what the Commission called an “egregious” threatening of fire inspectors during a
September 29, 2018 inspection, despite inspectors testifying that they didn’t consider
anything about the interaction to be physically threatening; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts ACLU has concluded that the License Commission’s action is in
violation of First Amendment free speech and due process protections under the U.S.
Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, partially because residents
and business owners have a right to object to how public employees are carrying out
their duties; and

WHEREAS:

Fire enforcement officials cited UpperWest over their use of tea light candles for mood
lighting, even though two city officials later testified that Cambridge has no law
prohibiting the use of candles in restaurants, and the state statute only governs the use
of candles as “portable cooking equipment”, which were not in use at UpperWest for
any period of time; and

WHEREAS:

UpperWest has twice been unreasonably denied a fair and impartial hearing for a
package store license application, one of which is now under appeal, with the License
Commission determining that there was “no public need” despite overwhelming
support and need expressed by the public; and

WHEREAS:

UpperWest has been the target of persistent excessive enforcement and unfair denial of
their right to fair and impartial hearings, possibly as retaliation for their criticism of
Commission practices over the past five years, and exposing the License
Commission’s failure to comply with state law in its handling of liquor licenses, and
UpperWest owners representing Cambridge business owners in pursuing their legal
rights against the city; and

Packet Pg. 450

2.8

WHEREAS:

In its efforts to punish UpperWest, the city has repeatedly violated state law as
determined by the Attorney General’s Office, including a violation of the Open
Meeting Law in the creation of the decision to suspend UpperWest’s liquor license;
and

WHEREAS:

This conduct by the city is unacceptable and contrary to the stated council goal of
“integrating businesses of all sizes into a thriving ecosystem”; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the License Commission
and City Solicitor’s office to drop all charges against UpperWest and its owners, to
reconsider UpperWest’s package store application, and to issue a public apology to
UpperWest and its owners; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to investigate the License
Commission’s extreme abuse of discretion and power in regards to UpperWest’s liquor
license suspension and package store application denials; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to meet with UpperWest owners to
discuss generally how the License Commission practices can be improved; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
this matter no later than September 9, 2019.
In City Council September 16, 2019.
Adopted as amended by the affirmative vote of nine members.

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

In March of 2014, the License Commission refused to allow UpperWest to open at its
original location at 1001 Massachusetts Avenue, despite having required UpperWest to
invest money to build the space prior to applying for the liquor license, apparently in
order to protect a neighboring bar from competition; and

WHEREAS:

The owners of UpperWest, located at 1 Cedar Street, were issued a five-day liquor
license suspension by the License Commission at a November 7, 2018 hearing, over
what the Commission called an “egregious” threatening of fire inspectors during a
September 29, 2018 inspection, despite inspectors testifying that they didn’t consider
anything about the interaction to be physically threatening; and

WHEREAS:

The Massachusetts ACLU has concluded that the License Commission’s action is in
violation of First Amendment free speech and due process protections under the U.S.
Constitution and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, partially because residents
and business owners have a right to object to how public employees are carrying out
their duties; and

WHEREAS:

Fire enforcement officials cited UpperWest over their use of tea light candles for mood
lighting, even though two city officials later testified that Cambridge has no law
prohibiting the use of candles in restaurants, and the state statute only governs the use
of candles as “portable cooking equipment”, which were not in use at UpperWest for
any period of time; and

WHEREAS:

UpperWest has twice been unreasonably denied a fair and impartial hearing for a
package store license application, one of which is now under appeal, with the License
Commission determining that there was “no public need” despite overwhelming
support and need expressed by the public; and

WHEREAS:

UpperWest has been the target of persistent excessive enforcement and unfair denial of
their right to fair and impartial hearings, possibly as retaliation for their criticism of
Commission practices over the past five years, and exposing the License
Commission’s failure to comply with state law in its handling of liquor licenses, and
UpperWest owners representing Cambridge business owners in pursuing their legal
rights against the city; and

WHEREAS:

In its efforts to punish UpperWest, the city has repeatedly violated state law as
determined by the Attorney General’s Office, including a violation of the Open
Meeting Law in the creation of the decision to suspend UpperWest’s liquor license;
and

WHEREAS:

This conduct by the city is unacceptable and contrary to the stated council goal of
“integrating businesses of all sizes into a thriving ecosystem”; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the License Commission
and City Solicitor’s office to drop all charges against UpperWest and its owners, to
reconsider UpperWest’s package store application, and to issue a public apology to
UpperWest and its owners; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to investigate the License
Commission’s extreme abuse of discretion and power in regards to UpperWest’s liquor
license suspension and package store application denials; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to meet with UpperWest owners to
discuss generally how the License Commission practices can be improved; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
this matter no later than September 9, 2019.

New Street Overlay District
Proposed amendments:
Our objective in suggesting these amendments is:
1) To ensure that if any site included in the New Street Overlay District is redeveloped
as self storage it would be required to devote a minimum of 20% of its gross floor area
to affordable housing, rather than only a minimum of 20,000 sf and,
2) To ensure that more affordable housing is produced by stipulating that if any site in
the New Street Overlay District is redeveloped as housing without self storage, the
greater density (up to 3.0 FAR), increased height (up to 65’), reduced lot area per
dwelling unit (300 sf), and lower parking requirements would only be available for a
100% affordable project.

Additions are in bold red. Strikethroughs also are bolded.
20.95 Special Gross Floor Area Provision. The Floor Area Ratio for a self storage facility
(Section 4.37.n) may be increased in the New Street Overlay District to 3.0 of the lot
area by issuance of a Special Permit from the Planning Board. The additional area is
intended to allow for the construction of a commercially viable self storage facility and
may be used only on lots that are greater than 300 feet in depth, but do not have street
frontage of 150 feet.
20.95.1 Criteria for Granting Special Permit. In granting the Special Permit for increases
in Floor Area and height for a self storage facility pursuant to this section, the Planning
Board shall find that the additional GFA proposed can be reasonably accommodated on
the site without generating significant traffic that will have an adverse effect of
surrounding uses. In addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board shall find that such
development has met all of the following criteria in addition to the other criteria specified
in Section 10.43:
1. The development contains at least 20,000 sf twenty percent (20%) of gross
floor area devoted to affordable housing which shall comply with and be subject
to the provisions of the Inclusionary Housing requirements provisions of Article
11.200. The square footage devoted to affordable housing shall be excluded
from the Gross Floor Area for the purpose of calculating Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
2. Public benefits that will enhance and benefit the use of the adjoining Danehy
Park and/or the adjacent residential neighborhood.

3. The project contains sustainability elements such as solar energy systems,
stormwater management systems, and net zero energy standards. The
project is designed to be “net zero ready” or as close as feasible and meets
or exceeds all municipal stormwater management and sustainability
requirements.
4. The project makes Pprovisions for affordable short-term storage for low-income
Cambridge residents households.
5. The project provides adequate space for loading and bicycle parking as
determined by the Traffic Parking & Transportation Department.
20.96 Special Dimensional Requirements for Residential Uses. In order to enhance the
mixed use character of New Street and to encourage the construction of additional
affordable housing to replace existing automobile related and light industrial uses, the
dimensional requirements for housing uses in the base zoning district shall be may be
modified for projects offering 100% permanently affordable housing that complies
with and is subject to the provisions of the Inclusionary Housing requirements of
Article 11.200. The square footage devoted to affordable housing shall be
excluded from the Gross Floor Area for the purpose of calculating Floor Area
Ratio (FAR). The dimensional requirements of the base district may be modified
upon issuance of a Special Permit by the Planning Board as follows:
20.96.1 Maximum Height. The maximum height for affordable residential uses shall be
may be increased to sixty-five feet (65’), provided however that no building shall
exceed 55 feet (55’) without complying with a 45-degree bulk plane setback.
20.96.2 Gross Floor Area. The gross floor area for affordable residential uses shall be
may be increased up to 3.0.
20.96.3 Lot Area per Dwelling Unit. The Lot Area per Dwelling Unit shall be may be
reduced to 300 sf for affordable residential uses.
20.96.4 Parking Requirements. The parking requirements for residential uses shall be
may be no greater than .75 .5 per dwelling unit, provided however that parking for
affordable units, including such dwelling units constructed as part of a self storage
facility, shall be may be reduced to .5 .4 per dwelling unit.
20.96.5 Criteria for Granting Special Permit. The additional criteria for a self
storage facility in Section 20.95.1.2, 20.95.1.3 and 20.95.1.5 above shall apply to
residential uses to the extent possible and at the discretion of the Planning
Board. In evaluating a residential project, the Planning Board shall follow the

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN
WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the Cambridge Carnival
International that was scheduled to take place on September 8, 2019 has been canceled
by the City Manager due to security concerns; and

WHEREAS:

Carnival is the largest festival in Cambridge and has been a cherished institution for 26
years, with thousands of attendees every year, and remains one of the only celebrations
specifically focused on uplifting black and brown culture in Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

Carnival is rooted in the history of enslaved African and colored people and indentured
servants in Trinidad and Tobago, born out of these communities of color celebrating
their freedom after slavery ended in the 1800s, and as this historical connection is very
important to the Afro-Caribbean community in Cambridge, the cancellation has been
felt as a direct affront to their culture, tradition and freedom; and

WHEREAS:

Countless vendors and artists, many of whom are Cambridge residents themselves,
stand to lose considerable amounts of money due to the last-minute nature of this
cancellation, including through food supplies that have already been purchased, and
others have spent all year preparing for a performance that now will not happen; and

WHEREAS:

At a recent community discussion, it became clear that the emotional and financial
impacts of this decision on the African-American and Caribbean communities in
Cambridge, as well as the community as a whole, have not been sufficiently addressed;
and

WHEREAS:

Many members of the community do not feel they were sufficiently informed,
consulted and included in the decision to cancel Carnival, which is unprecedented in
both the long history of the event in Cambridge as well as in the more than 50-year
tradition of Carnival in the United States; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Police
Commissioner, the Carnival Committee, the Mayor’s Office and the community to
organize an alternative event to take place in Cambridge on the Carnival’s rain date or
sometime thereafter, that will allow vendors to sell their products and potentially
recover at least some of the costs; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Police
Commissioner, Carnival Committee, and community members to ensure that future
Carnivals in 2020 and beyond happen as anticipated; and be it further

WHEREAS:

Maria L. Cardozo, a lifelong resident of Cambridge, has been the keeper of her
family’s history, traditions, and papers, which document four generations of African
Americans as radical abolitionists, civil rights crusaders, supporters of women’s rights,
and advocates for children at risk; and

WHEREAS:

Maria’s maternal great grandfather, Robert Johnson, born a slave but literate, escaped
from Richmond, Virginia to Boston via the Underground Railroad in 1829, he was a
member of the first African Baptist Church of Boston and later a deacon under
abolitionist and Underground Railroad Conductor Reverend Leonard Grimes at the
Twelfth Baptist Church on Beacon Hill (known as the “fugitive slave church”), and
through his ties to the church, Johnson aided escaped slaves, supported efforts to
desegregate the Boston schools, and encouraged black men to pay taxes so they could
vote, and Johnson was one of three men who helped rescue abolitionist William Lloyd
Garrison when a pro-slavery mob in Boston was threatening his life; and

WHEREAS:

In 1834, Robert Johnson married Clarissa West of Pomfret, Connecticut, the two
purchased a house at 16 Belknap Street (now 69 Joy Street) on Beacon Hill in Boston
in 1853, and in the coming years the couple had four sons: Robert, Jr., Henry West,
Frederick, and William; and

WHEREAS:

During the Civil War, both Henry and Robert, Jr. served with the 55th Massachusetts
Volunteer Infantry, known as the “Brave Black Regiment,” Clarissa Johnson died on
July 19, 1863, and her son, Robert, Jr., died in 1865 as a prisoner of war in Charleston,
SC; and

WHEREAS:

Maria’s maternal great grandmother, Evelina Bell Johnson, Robert Johnson’s second
wife whom he married in 1866 (she and Robert would have two children, Charles and
Mary Adelaide), also came from a family of abolitionists – Evelina and her mother,
Prudence Nelson Bell, were born into slavery in Virginia but were brought to Boston
with the help of abolitionists Charles Sumner, Henry David Thoreau, John Albion
Andrew, and Cantabrigian Thomas Wentworth Higginson in 1855 because they were
relatives of the famous Mary Mildred Botts Williams, a child slave of mixed race who
Packet Pg. 669

5.1

became the symbol used by abolitionists as a turning point against slavery – Prudence
Nelson Bell settled in Weymouth, MA, where she was active in assisting fugitive
slaves on the Underground Railroad; and
WHEREAS:

Maria’s maternal grandfather, Charles Johnson, and her maternal grandmother,
Florence Ribble Johnson, left Joy Street in 1904 and settled in Cambridge to raise their
four children, Charles, Jr., Evelyn, Robert, and Margaret, on Hovey Avenue and later
on Parker Street – Charles, Sr. was a successful vaudeville artist in Chicago and a
horseback riding instructor, he spent his career working in the State House Library and
served as a sergeant in the Cambridge Auxiliary Police, and notably, Charles led the
Cambridge Centennial parade in 1946, driving a stagecoach; and

WHEREAS:

Maria’s mother, Evelyn Johnson Cardozo, grew up in Cambridge and, like her siblings,
graduated from Cambridge High and Latin, she was mentored by Boston-based civil
rights activist William Monroe Trotter, who encouraged her to desegregate the Bryant
and Stratton Secretarial School in Boston, and after graduation, Evelyn went to the
Tuskegee Institute to teach (where she became friends with George Washington
Carver) and once back in Boston, she worked as a secretary at the State House and
later received a B.A. in Business Administration from Boston University, finishing her
career as a secretary at the Cambridge School in Weston, while volunteering at the
Cambridge Community Center; and

WHEREAS:

Maria’s father, Antonio Cardozo, arrived in the United States on his own at age 17 in
1920 from Cape Verde, Portugal without any money and unable speak English, yet he
would eventually graduate from Suffolk University with a law degree, Harvard
University, and Tufts University to become, by the 1950s, one of the most successful
black lawyers in Boston, he served as the Director of Cambridge’s Portuguese Credit
Union, on the Tufts Board of Trustees, and Harvard University’s Visiting Committee,
and he and Evelyn proudly raised their daughters in the family home at 16 Kirkland
Road; and

WHEREAS:

Carol L. Cardozo, Maria’s sister, spent her career in public service – first as a librarian
and later as research associate at the Massachusetts Taxpayers Association and the
Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts
Boston, she worked tirelessly to empower women in politics and leadership, and she
was an advocate for women in the criminal justice system; and

WHEREAS:

Maria distinguished herself by balancing her education and career while taking care of
her family after the untimely death of her mother in 1961 (who, in 1942, integrated
Cambridge’s Shady Hill School, and later the Cambridge Skating Club) – Maria
attended Sarah Lawrence College, graduated from Boston University, and the
University of Lisbon, the first half of her career was dedicated to children at risk,
serving as a social worker at Roxbury’s James Jackson Putnam Center for Children,
the Cambridge Community Center, and at Columbia Point’s first Head Start program,
and later she transitioned to the field of law where she served as a paralegal in her
father’s Boston law firm; and

WHEREAS:

Maria donated her family’s collection, the Johnson Cardozo Family Papers, which
connects four generations of African Americans to Cambridge, to the Cambridge
Public Library’s Archives and Special Collections as a way to preserve the unique
history of the city’s African American community, and her donation was made in
loving memory of her sister, Carol L. Cardozo, 1944-2017; and
Packet Pg. 670

5.1

WHEREAS:

The Johnson Cardozo Family Papers is the first collection the Library has received
during its new initiative to preserve and make available the history of Cambridge’s
African American community, and to honor Maria’s generous donation, the Library
hosted a Juneteenth Celebration on Wednesday June 19, 2019, during which time The
Johnson Cardozo Family Papers, including Robert Johnson’s Family Bible, were on
display to the public for the first time; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record thanking Maria L. Cardozo for her generous
donation of her family’s papers to the Cambridge Public Library as well as her effort to
preserve and make available to the public Cambridge’s African American history in
perpetuity; and be it further

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of
this resolution to Maria L. Cardozo and the Cambridge Public Library on behalf of the

WHEREAS:

After decades of decline in tobacco use among youth, the use of e-cigarettes (“vaping”)
is reversing that trend and now ranks as the most commonly used tobacco product
among U.S. youth; and

WHEREAS:

According to the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office, usage of e-cigarettes among U.S.
youth increased 900% during 2011-2015, with some 3.6 million youth nationally—or 1
in 5 high schoolers and 1 in 20 middle schoolers—using the product which is
demonstrated to have significant health impacts and is linked to the deaths of six
people and 450 cases of lung illness as of writing; and

WHEREAS:

In December of 2018, Massachusetts’ own Department of Public Health Commissioner
Dr. Monica Bharel declared that e-cigarette use among youth and young adults is a
“public health epidemic,” mirroring statements made by health officials across the
country and U.S. Surgeon General; and

WHEREAS:

Despite the mounting evidence of significant health risk associated with e-cigarette use
among youth, the FDA has reported that JUUL (the most popular e-cigarette product
on the market) has been illegally marketing kid-friendly flavors and products to youth,
and issued a warning letter as recently as September 9, 2019, to JUUL for making
statements to students during a presentation that JUUL “was 99% safer than cigarettes”
and that they were “totally safe;” and

WHEREAS:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory
Committee concluded that menthol flavored tobacco products increased nicotine
dependence and decreased success in smoking cessation; and

WHEREAS:

Menthol makes it easier for youth to initiate tobacco use; and

WHEREAS:

Numerous municipalities and state agencies across the country and the Commonwealth
are taking action to limit youths’ exposure to e-cigarettes and to flavored tobacco
products; now therefore be it

establishments (“smoke shops”) which are accessible to individuals 21 years
or older;
• Eliminate the exemption for menthol flavored tobacco products; and
• Amend existing language on minimum cigar pricing to eliminate a loophole in
our current ordinance that is being used to sell cigars at predatory prices;
• Other related legislation to keep such addictive and harmful drugs out of the
hands of youth and to limit their exposure to advertising of e-cigarette and
other tobacco products; and be it further

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Department of

WHEREAS:

Similar to so many other communities in Eastern Massachusetts, the City of
Cambridge regularly urges its residents to forgo traveling in personal vehicles in favor
of utilizing public transportation whenever possible, yet the shaky infrastructure of our
public mass transit system has made this an incredible challenge for those with
mobility impairments; and

WHEREAS:

The elevator located at the MBTA station in Central Square has been out of order since
April 2018, the elevators in the Harvard Square station have also been taken out of
commission for repairs, and the extended loss of these elevators means that anyone
who uses a wheelchair or otherwise cannot utilize the stairs must find elaborate, timeconsuming ways to navigate around these stations; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council and other elected officials have long urged the MBTA and the
Commonwealth to fully and swiftly repair the non-functioning elevators, yet
commuters continue to be met with excuses as to why a timely resolution to this issue
is not possible; and

WHEREAS:

While mass transit riders are likely appreciative of the fact that there may be no simple
fix for the issues at hand, the prospect of waiting until mid-2020, at the earliest, for
these issues to be resolved is simply unreasonable and a heavy burden on far too many
of those who depend upon the MBTA; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record urging the MBTA to take whatever emergency
measures are necessary to fast-track repairs to the elevators in the Central Square and
Harvard Square MBTA stations, and to share these plans with the City Council in a
timely manner; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of
this Order to the Honorable Governor Charles D. Baker, to Secretary and CEO of

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that there has been a recent spike in
activity in terms of financial scams targeting senior citizens in Cambridge and
surrounding areas; and

WHEREAS:

These financial scams often come in the form of unsolicited telephone calls and emails
designed to trick seniors into fearing negative repercussions if they do not immediately
send money to the scammers, and often once the money is gone there is no way to
recover it; and

WHEREAS:

The best defense against these types of scams is to have a well-informed public,
allowing people to have their guard up against those who would take advantage of
them, and it would therefore be wise for the City to make a concerted effort to spread
information about these scams; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

The Mayor’s Office hosted Cambridge Public School students in grades K-3rd for City
Hall visits that highlighted civic engagement and invited Cambridge’s youngest
residents to share their important voice as participants in mock city council meetings;
and

WHEREAS:

At these meetings, aspiring public commenters, councillors, city managers, and mayors
raised several issues of importance to their constituencies, marshalled research and
data to back up their positions, and made impassioned speeches to their peers on the
mock council; and

WHEREAS:

Of frequent concern to young councillors and commenters alike was a desire to see
more water features in Cambridge’s public parks, if they could be constructed in a way
that did not freeze during the winter, would provide cooling to young people and
seniors during increasingly warm summer months, and would not they negatively
impact the environment; and

WHEREAS:

The Mayor’s Office also heard from over 250 kindergarteners from across the district
as they participated in the Our Cambridge project; students studied the design and
construction process and were asked as classroom teams to build a model of what they
think could make Cambridge a fairer and more interesting place for children and
families; any of these models recognized the importance of water in our day to day life
as well as in play; and

WHEREAS:

Of the mock councils that were held, four out of five voted to request the City Manager
to increase access to water features in Cambridge’s public parks, with dissenting
councillors most adroitly citing waste of water and other environmental concerns for
why they could not support the proposal; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

In response to the wishes of our young residents, that the City Manager be and hereby
is requested to work with the Department of Public Works (DPW) to create a new
water feature in one of Cambridge’s parks for the summer of 2021 and to construct
said water feature in a way that conserves water as much as possible and is minimally
impactful to the environment; and be it further

WHEREAS:

It has come to the attention of the City Council that vehicular idling is a persistent and

WHEREAS:

Unnecessary idling for more than 5 minutes is against state law; and

WHEREAS:

Idling is a particular problem on streets with metered parking spots, including Bishop
Allen Drive between Inman Street and Prospect Street, but elsewhere as well; and

WHEREAS:

Many idling vehicles are rideshare drivers waiting to be told where they need to go to
pick up their next ride; and

WHEREAS:

There are many software applications for fleet management that use GPS location and
other information to detect if a vehicle is idling; and

WHEREAS:

Rideshare apps could easily be modified to detect that a vehicle has been sitting in the
same spot for more than 5 minutes and in that case, could notify the driver to turn off
the engine if it is running; and

WHEREAS:

Currently only the Police can issue tickets for idling, but response time to complaints
makes this an impractical enforcement strategy, especially for the large amount of
rideshare drivers that idle in many locations across the city; and

WHEREAS:

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department enforcement agents are currently only
authorized to address idling when a vehicle is stopped in an unpaid metered parking
spot, and are not authorized to ticket idlers at meters that have been paid for, in a nonmonitored car storage spot, or elsewhere; now therefore be it

Lesley University is a leader in higher education, especially for first-generation college
