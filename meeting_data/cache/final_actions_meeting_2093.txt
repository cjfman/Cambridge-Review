To the Honorable, the City Council:
In accordance with Chapter 121B of the Massachusetts General Laws, I am hereby requesting City
Council confirmation on the recommendation to reappointment of Margaret Drury as a member of the
Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) Board for a term of five years. I am further requesting that
this recommendation be forwarded to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts
& Celebrations Committee or other suitable committee for a public hearing as outlined in City Council
Rule Number 32C.
Ms. Drury has been the Vice Chair of the CRA Board for the past 6 years and has worked collaboratively
with its members. She is a dedicated, strong advocate for affordable housing and other essential services
for under-represented populations in Cambridge and has inspired the CRA to apply its resources in these
areas. She was an early advocate for the CRA's involvement in the Foundry and has been a leader for the
CRA as it considers how to expand its role into the arenas of workforce development, housing and
neighborhood investments beyond Kendall Square.
Ms. Drury's knowledge of parliamentary procedures, relevant municipal ordinances and state law has
been invaluable to guiding policy as well as partnering with the City on interagency projects. She has
been instrumental to the re-creation of the CRA as a community-minded, responsive agency.
Additionally, Ms. Drury's reappointment is strongly supported by Thomas Evans, CRA Executive
Director and Kathy Born, Chair of the CRA.

March 13, 2018
Policy Order O-2 dated March 5, 2018 regarding applying for the
Housing Choice Designation

Community Development Department staff have been tracking the rollout of
the Commonwealth’s new Housing Choice Initiative.
Through the Housing Choice Initiative, communities that have met certain
housing production benchmarks can be designated as Housing Choice
Communities. Designated communities will have access to grant funds for
infrastructure improvements through the Housing Choice Grant Program, and
will also receive bonus points or other preferred consideration for certain
other state grant programs.
The application for Housing Choice designation is now available. To receive the
Housing Choice designation as a High Production community requires
demonstrating an increase in year-round housing units of 5% or 500 units over
the last 5 years. Cambridge meets this housing production threshold, and we
will provide information to demonstrate that.
CDD staff are now completing the application for Housing Choice Community
designation, and will submit it to the Commonwealth ahead of the April 30,
2018 application deadline so that the City can be designated as a Housing
Choice Community. The application for the Housing Choice Grant Program is
not yet available. Staff have contacted the State to request additional
information about the Program, and will continue to monitor funding
opportunities that become available through this program.

To the Honorable, the City Council:

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 17-108, regarding posting signboards at
development sites, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa and Assistant City Manager for Community
Development Iram Farooq report the following:
This Policy Order asks to explore the feasibility of requiring a posted “signboard” at
development sites requiring Large Project Review or a Special Permit that contains the following
information:
•Contact information for a site manager
•A brief description of the project (including whether it is residential, commercial, or mixeduse, and, if residential, the total number of units and inclusionary units, an expected completion
date, and a rendering of the street-facing elevation)
•A web link where more information is available
On-site notification is a useful way to provide information to the general public. However, in
order to impose requirements that are meaningful and effective in practice, it is important to
consider several factors, including the way that new requirements would interact with current
requirements and the applicability of different types of information at different stages of the
development process.
Current On-Site Notification Requirements and Practices
Special Permits
Per zoning (Section 10.42.1

Packet Pg. 28

1.6

<http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/externallinks/zoningordinance/article10>), notification
panels must be installed on property that is subject to a Planning Board special permit or a Board
of Zoning Appeal (BZA) special permit or variance. Panels are provided by CDD or ISD when a
public hearing has been scheduled, and must be installed at least 14 days before the hearing date
and maintained until a Notice of Decision is filed. Panels must be within 20 feet of the street line
and legible from the public street.
Each panel contains the following information:
•
Address
•
Owner
•
Applicant
•
Case number
•
Date, time, and location of the public hearing
•
Project description, including the amount of development, type of development, and
zoning ordinance section or sections
•
Contact information to get more information or to submit comments to the Planning
Board/BZA
Pre-Application Community Engagement
In 2016, the Planning Board adopted changes to its rules to require community engagement by
an applicant prior to submitting a special permit application. Per these rules (See Section 5
<http://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/CDD/ZoningDevel/PlanningBoard/pb_rules_2016
0322.pdf?la=en>), the minimum requirement for community engagement is to hold at least one
community meeting near the project site that is open to the general public. CDD staff are notified
of upcoming meetings, and post information about such meetings on the CDD web page.
CDD provides a set of Community Engagement Guidelines
<http://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/CDD/ZoningDevel/PlanningBoard/pb_cdd_engag
ement_guidelines_may2016.pdf?la=en> and consults with applicants on the appropriate type of
outreach for a given project. Some guidelines include the following:
• Directly notify “parties of interest” (abutting property owners, and abutters to those
abutters within 300 feet of the project site - CDD often provides a list of property owners
based on Assessing records) and nearby residents
• Notify established neighborhood groups in that neighborhood and surrounding
neighborhoods (these are available on the CDD web site, including contact information
provided to CDD by neighborhood group organizers)
• Use web sites, social media, and neighborhood e-mail lists to provide information about
the project and publicize upcoming meetings
• Use posters or signs on-site, and other locations, to provide information and publicize
upcoming meetings
Packet Pg. 29

1.6

These options are provided as guidelines, rather than requirements, because the appropriate set of
measures can vary depending on the scale and nature of the project. For example, some smaller
projects have not created a dedicated web page but have focused more on personal engagement
with immediate neighbors, while some larger projects have created a robust web presence using
services that specialize in promoting public dialogue around planning and development (an
example is the locally-based company coUrbanize).
Large Project Review
In zoning districts designated as “Areas of Special Planning Concern,” new construction of at
least 2,000 square feet is required to undergo a non-binding public development consultation
called “Large Project Review” (Section 19.43
http://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/externallinks/zoningordinance/article19>). This requirement
is waived for projects that are required to seek a special permit from the Planning Board, which
means that it most often applies to smaller or medium-sized projects that do not trigger a
threshold requiring Planning Board approval.
The applicant is required to provide plans, elevations, and other technical information about the
proposal to CDD. The Large Project Review consultation must be scheduled and held within 10
days of receiving the required materials, and CDD makes a report within 10 days of the
consultation to certify completion of the process.
Per zoning, CDD notifies owners of abutting properties along with individuals and organizations
that have requested notification of upcoming consultations. No on-site notification of the
consultation is required by zoning.
Construction Process
There is no uniform requirement for posting on-site information after permits have been issued
or during the construction process. For some larger-scale projects that have received special
permits, there is a special permit condition to follow a Construction Management Program,
which often includes posting contact information on-site and providing regular updates to the
community. Sometimes developers will post or provide this information voluntarily. Also, most
project sites will have signs identifying the construction company and/or providing renderings of
the project, expected completion dates, and other information for marketing purposes.
For projects that do not have a special permit and are not required to obtain a special permit, the
zoning ordinance would need to be amended in order to make provision of such signage
mandatory.
Timing Considerations
The following pieces of information were suggested by the Council to be provided on a required
“signboard” for certain projects:
Packet Pg. 30

1.6

•
•
•
•
•
•

Contact information for a site manager
Brief description of the project including land use
Total number of units and inclusionary units, if residential
Expected completion date
Rendering of the street-facing elevation
A web link where more information is available

Most of these items would be difficult to provide at the early community engagement stage of a
project or even at the special permit or development consultation stage, because the details of the
project would still be subject to review, comment, and revision, and there is often no
construction coordinator or detailed schedule while the project is still undergoing planning and
design. The Planning Board could consider requiring posting of this information during the
construction phase of projects having a special permit in order to raise awareness of a project and
allow members of the public to directly contact the developer or contractor with questions related
to the construction process.

March 13, 2018
Policy Order O-18 dated February 26, 2018 regarding a timeline for
the next Incentive Zoning Study

In response to the above-mentioned policy order, we provide the following
information.
BACKGROUND
On September 28, 2015, the City Council voted to adopt an amendment to the
City’s Incentive Zoning Ordinance which significantly expanded the list of nonresidential uses subject to the Incentive provisions and increased the Housing
Contribution Rate to $12.00 per square foot of non-residential floor area, with
three annual increases and annual CPI adjustment.
The Housing Contribution Rate is now $14.95 per square foot, with provision for
a final $1.00 annual increase scheduled in September 2018 and continued
annual CPI adjustment.
The 2015 amendment allows for a reevaluation of the Housing Contribution
Rate three years from the time the rate was last amended by the City Council.
TIMELINE AND NEXT STEPS
Community Development Department Housing staff are now preparing
to revisit the Incentive Zoning Nexus Study beginning in fall 2018, as allowed by
the 2015 amendment. Funding for this study will be included in the City
Manager's FY2019 budget submission.
If the FY2019 funding is approved, we will initiate the procurement process to
select a consultant for the Nexus Study in summer 2018, with a goal of initiating
the study in fall 2018.
We anticipate that the Nexus Study will take six to eight months, consistent
with the duration of the 2015 study. A more specific schedule to complete the

For the 2018 Nexus Study we plan to follow a methodology similar to that used
in the 2015 study, which reviewed economic factors, housing trends, and the
nexus between new non-residential development and the demand for
affordable housing. We would be pleased to discuss the approach prior to
issuing an RFP for the study to be sure that it is consistent with
the City Council's goals.

Reconsidering bike path lanes and traffic flow

Dear City Leaders,
First I want to thank the City Council for agreeing to appoint a task force to study a better plan for bike paths
commensurate with pedestrian and car traffic. It is critically evident that the plan as implemented is not
working and in fact quite dangerous in busy streets. Besides being unaesthetic with quickly rusting and injured
poles, I have witnessed several near misses with paths for cars and trucks being narrowed too much, car
drivers trying to exit with vehicles driving by too closely, and bikes and pedestrians exiting passenger side
doors colliding.
Good examples are Cambridge Street which has been literally torn apart by the current design and Brattle
Street. I have seen drivers struggle to exit in front of Skendarian's Apothecary and get nearly clipped- many of
them older or drivers with restricted mobility--unable to move fast. I have personally stopped to help
confused driver-tourists in Brattle Street realize they were stopped behind a parked car- not just traffic- when
they come into Brattle Street from Harvard Sqaure.
I would hope the committee can look at some of the plans used in Europe where the sidewalks are color
coded for bikes and for pedestrians-- a much safer plan--even if it means extending sidewalks in some places.
I also would urge you to appoint Robert Skendarian to this task force. He represents informed and concerned
business and consumer interests in Cambridge.
Living in the Porter Square-Fresh Pond area the incredible over-boon of residential units in almost every
postage stamp of green space makes the need to carefully consider increased auto and bike traffic even more
critical.
Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

thanks for working group on bike lanes

Dear city manager, city council, and city clerk,
I am so grateful to see you're creating a working group on bike lanes.. especially those on Cambridge
St. and Brattle St. I'm grateful you listened to the many people around the mid-Camb section of
Cambridge St. who are not happy with the implementation.
I hope you'll create the group quickly, and that you'll include Robert Skendarian. Yes, he asked us to
endorse him, but I do think he'll be a good representative for the neighborhood. Here's hoping you
also include people who can speak for three other groups: 1) those who are generally older and
slower, 2) those with disabilities that keep them off bikes (and possibly out of the driver seat), and 3)
parents and others who struggle to find parking to drop off/pick up their kids/family members at the
high school and War Memorial pool.
You probably heard about the enormous thread of emails on Next Door when the lanes were first
established. From what I remember, those were the groups most disadvantaged by the lanes.. who
had the most right/reason to complain, but may not have been heard adequately, or felt they were
heard.
Thanks for listening!

Block party fees

I'm writing to support the policy order submitted by Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, and
Councillor Siddiqui.
The annual street party on the first block of Chilton Street has been a great success for ten-plus
years. It runs on a shoestring budget of small donations that cover the street closing fee, plates and
utensils, and soft drinks; some of our neighbors are musicians who graciously donate their talent,
which adds enormousy to the festive atmosphere. The $50 entertainment fee the city has charged
us the last several years for that live music seems unduly burdensome, especially for a party that
runs only from 4 to 7pm.
Thanks for your consideration.

Tenant's Right of First Refusal

Dear Councilors,
I am very sorry I was not at the City Council meeting last night to give my comments on this issue as I was
away visiting my brother who is facing myriad of health issues.
This issues brought back the memories of the rent control days as I turned to rental property as a means of
funding my children's college education. I tried to be as reasonable landlord as I could possibly be but it was
extremely difficult to maintain my property given the low rent and extreme difficulty in getting rent increase
approved. I was very fortunate to have had reasonable tenants but many tenants misused the rent control to
save money to buy their own property!
And here we are yet again with a proposal that could be misused by the tenants to make the life of responsible
property owners a nightmare.
Right of First Refusal got things backward. Giving the tenant 90 days or more to match the offer being
considered by the property owner after the purchase and sales agreement is signed will give both the property
owner and the purchaser undue stress for the benefit of the tenant, making a sale of property a much longer
process. Rather it should be the other way around. The property owner should first negotiate with the tenant(s)
giving them first dibs at making reasonable offer(s). With the tenant(s) offer(s) in hand, the property owner can
either accept the offer(s) or put the house on the market for better offer. Should there be better offer, then the
tenant(s) should be given a chance to counter propose. I think this will be the fairest way of protecting interest
of all concerned.
Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

in support of home rule petition for a Cambridge Right of First Refusal Legislation

To Whom It May Concern:
I would like to state my support for the tenant Right of First Refusal. In a state in which high rents are becoming
increasingly impossible to afford, and the price of home ownership is out of many people's reach, it does not serve a
community to have a transitory population. As a public school teacher, I would not be able to live in Cambridge without
this city's unfailing support of economic diversity (through the first time home-buyer program) and I am in support of
creating more legislation to support ALL members of this city, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Protecting
tenant's rights will in turn protect the investments and property values of owners, as a stable rental market preserves
the economy of Cambridge and maintains devoted citizens of this community.
Thank you,

Bear with me for a second. On Election Day 2017, I held a candidate's sign. Standing nearby was a Cambridge
police officer working a street reconstruction site and we got to talking. He said that of the most recent
officers accepted, 2 were living as roommates, 2 were staying with family, and the rest lived outside the city
(sometimes well beyond Cambridge).
I got my start here, thanks to the first-time homebuyers' program more than 20 years ago.
When I attended Mayor McGovern's open house earlier this year, I met a woman and her elementary school
son. She told me she's been "on the list" for a long time, trying to find housing.
We simply cannot refuse to try.
Sincerely,
Ann Stewart

Block party fees

I'm writing to support the policy order submitted by Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, and
Councillor Siddiqui.
The annual street party on the first block of Chilton Street has been a great success for ten-plus
years. It runs on a shoestring budget of small donations that cover the street closing fee, plates and
utensils, and soft drinks; some of our neighbors are musicians who graciously donate their talent,
which adds enormousy to the festive atmosphere. The $50 entertainment fee the city has charged
us the last several years for that live music seems unduly burdensome, especially for a party that
runs only from 4 to 7pm.
Thanks for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Elizabeth Meyer
30 Chilton Street

Proposal to grant tenants a right of first refusal on residential property

This proposal could chill the market for rentals. If an owner wants to be free to sell to anyone without having to wait for
a tenant to exercise a right of first refusal, the straightforward way is not to have tenants.
Is the tenant obliged to match all the terms of the other offer, including financing percentage, and deadlines for signing
a P&S, for getting a mortgage commitment (not just a pre-approval letter), and closing? If not, what does the tenant
offer the owner in exchange?
Preserving rental housing is crucial. Home ownership is not a basic human right; housing is.
Please revise the proposal to balance these interests more fairly.

Tenant's Right to Purchase.

I urge the City Council to ask the legislature for a home rule petition allowing Cambridge to enact a tenant’s
right to purchase law. Every Council member talks about his/her determination to address the lack of

affordable housing in Cambridge. This is a chance for the Council to actually do something to address that
issue. Actions speak louder than words. If you don't vote for this now, don't claim in the future that you want
more affordable housing in Cambridge.

A Neighborhood Organization for the Betterment of East Cambridge

RE: Leggat McCall’s request to lease 420 parking spaces in the First Street Garage
Dear Mayor Marc C. McGovern; Vice Mayor Jan Devereux; Councillors Dennis J. Carlone, Craig A. Kelley,
Alanna M. Mallon, Sumbul Siddiqui, E. Denise Simmons, Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., Quinton Y. Zondervan:
On December 5, 2017, Leggat McCall requested that pursuant to an Order adopted by the City Council on
October 7, 2013, declaring “420 parking spaces and the first floor retail space at First Street Garage
Property available for disposition,” that the City continue the disposition process as detailed in Chapter
2.110 of the Cambridge Municipal Code (Disposition of City Property) and determine the value of the
leasehold interest. The event history of the Sullivan Courthouse special permit #228 and the intertwined
parking lease request pursuant to Chapter 2.110 is summarized in the attached table.
In response to Leggat’s request, the East Cambridge Planning Team unanimously passed a motion on
February 14, 2018 to request the City Manager, the City Council, and the Planning Board to restart the
Chapter 2.110 process from the beginning as opposed to resuming the process when it abandoned in
2014. ECPT requests the process restart because the economic context and urban landscape has
changed substantially from 2013 to 2018 including: the rapid development of Northpoint (including the Gore
St utility work), CambridgeSide’s desire to redevelop its 1st Street side (which may adversely impact
parking), the Green Line expansion, the new developments on 1st St. in PUD 4B, the buildout of Binney St,
the approved Volpe re-development, etc. ECPT is very interested in attending the meeting with the City
Manager for an opportunity to weigh in on the report being prepared pursuant to the disposition process.
The Leggat McCall development has been a very complex and divisive project for the neighborhood. ECPT
wants to ensure a community meeting, as set out in the Chapter 2.110 process, happens so that the
neighborhood will be informed on what will be analyzed in the report and what considerations are being
made in this disposition process.
Very truly yours,

Charles T. Hinds
President, ECPT

This “Trailblazing Women” event was conceived in tribute to and in honor of the
vibrant spirit and remarkable work of Renae Gray, a woman who energetically and
enthusiastically gave of herself in numerous ways, from serving on countless
committees to being a regular part of, and important voice in, the City’s ongoing public
discussions, in order to ensure her community was continually striving to be better
tomorrow than it was yesterday; and

WHEREAS:

In continuance of that proud tradition, on March 28, 2018, the Office of City Councilor
E. Denise Simmons, in partnership with the City Manager’s Office, the Cambridge

pursuit of academic excellence – and all of these strong, passionate, talented women
have left their imprints upon Cambridge, serving as inspirational role models for all
those around them; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council discussed early voting at length throughout the 2016-2017 term; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council adopted a policy order on June 13, 2016, requesting that the Election
Commission establish at least five polling locations to be open during the 11 day early
voting period allowed by state law in time for the 2016 general election; and

WHEREAS:

The Election Commission successfully executed this request, creating five early voting
locations available for the 11 days prior to the 2016 general election; and

WHEREAS:

This early voting period required an appropriation of $93,000 to cover costs associated
with early voting, and a second appropriation of $33,500 to cover wages associated
with early voting, both of which the City Council approved; and

WHEREAS:

Early voting allows registered voters to cast their ballots at one of five sites throughout
Cambridge before Election Day, providing them flexibility that often results in higher
voter turnout; and

WHEREAS:

Early voting was only executed for the 2016 State/Presidential general election, and
not for the following 2017 municipal election; and

WHEREAS:

The right to vote in elections for all levels of government is a critical foundation of our
democracy, especially in today’s political climate in which voting rights are under
attack; and

WHEREAS:

Early voting in the 2019 municipal election would be an important effort to increase
engagement, participation, turnout, and understanding of the importance of local
government; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Election
Commission regarding the possibility of instituting early voting in the 2019 municipal
election and what actions would be required by the City Council to do so; and be it

WHEREAS:

It was recently announced that the Longfellow Bridge is scheduled to reopen in May
2018 after nearly a decade of planning and construction; and

WHEREAS:

Cars regularly travel at 35 MPH or faster on the Longfellow Bridge, yet current plans
include two lanes for vehicular travel and no protected lane for cyclists; and

WHEREAS:

It is clear that preferred transit modes have shifted since the Longfellow Bridge Task
Force process began in 2009: According to data recently published by the Boston
Transportation Department, cyclists comprised 34.9% of inbound traffic on the bridge
during the morning commute in 2017, a nearly 10% increase from the previous year,
and the bridge was among the top 10 busiest cycling locations in the entire city of
Boston during 2017, despite the lack of a safe bicycle lane during construction; and

WHEREAS:

The bridge has been limited to one lane of inbound (to Boston) vehicular traffic for the
past 5 years during construction, and predictions of heavy backups did not come true;
and

WHEREAS:

The incline on the first half of the inbound side of the bridge makes it particularly
challenging to accommodate cyclists of varying abilities without a dedicated passing
lane; and

WHEREAS:

It is much easier for cyclists to dismount and get out of the way than it is for cars to
make enough room for emergency vehicles to get by, a double-wide protected bicycle
lane could also function as an emergency travel lane for ambulances on their way from
Cambridge to MGH hospital; and

WHEREAS:

Implementing protected bicycle infrastructure is in line with the stated Vision Zero
goals of both Cambridge and Boston as well as the state’s Healthy Transportation
Compact; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge State Representatives Mike Connolly and Jay Livingstone have already
signed on in support of this effort; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in support of implementing protected bicycle
infrastructure on the Longfellow Bridge before it reopens this May and urging the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation to work with advocates and stakeholders
to ensure the new bridge works for commuters of all transit modes; and be it further

energy
Ensure that low-income communities would benefit from solar energy and

WHEREAS:

The Baker-Polito Administration opened the process for Massachusetts cities and
towns to apply for federal designation as an Opportunity Zone on March 9, 2018; and

WHEREAS:

The recently passed U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 created the Opportunity Zone
Program to provide incentives for investment in low income communities throughout
the country, allowing the Governor of each state to nominate up to 25 percent of its
low-income census tracts (LICs) to be designated as Opportunity Zones; and

WHEREAS:

The Opportunity Zone designation will serve as an economic development tool for
municipalities and will incentivize investment in low income areas by offering
favorable federal tax treatment for investors; and

WHEREAS:

The designation would support and encourage affordable housing and economic
development in designated parts of the City, and would allow local governments to
propose a single tract, or a set of tracts, for designation; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct with the Assistant City
Manager for Community Development to apply for this designation on behalf of the
City of Cambridge by the March 22, 2018 deadline and report back to the City Council

WHEREAS:

Cambridge specifically and the Boston Metro Area in general are experiencing an
affordable housing crisis that is leading to gentrification and displacement in our
neighborhoods; and

WHEREAS:

US Senate bill S.548 “Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2017”, House
version is H.R.1661, provides significant opportunities to increase funding for
affordable housing construction and preservation through federal tax credits; and

WHEREAS:

The recent corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% will lead to a significantly
lower return on investment for tax credit financing of affordable housing, putting
negative pressure on this important financing instrument; and

WHEREAS:

S.548/H.R.1661 include other provisions such as income averaging and other
beneficial improvements to help finance affordable housing construction and
preservation that could help ameliorate the affordable housing crisis in Massachusetts;
and

WHEREAS:

Both members of Cambridge’s congressional delegation have signed on as co-sponsors
of the House bill, but neither Massachusetts Senator is listed as a co-sponsor of the
Senate bill; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in support of S.548/H.R.1661; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record urging our Senators to join Congressman Capuano
and Congresswoman Clark in cosponsoring this important bill; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of
this resolution to the Cambridge Legislative Delegation consisting of Congresswoman
Katherine Clark, Congressman Mike Capuano, and Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth
Warren on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS:

Cambridge Public School teachers have been expressing concern with a lack of
parking availability at or near Cambridge Public Schools reserved for, or able to be
utilized by, teachers; and

WHEREAS:

Some schools, such as the Amigos School, have small teacher parking lots that can
only accommodate less than a dozen vehicles, have no public parking lots or garages
within a reasonable distance, and cannot utilize metered on-street parking spaces
because they cannot leave children unattended to move their vehicles or “feed the
meter”; and

WHEREAS:

Teachers often “circle the block” looking for parking, contributing negatively to traffic
congestion and climate change; and

WHEREAS:

Some schools, such as Graham and Parks, have designated on-street parking for
teachers during the day and open to visitors and residents at night; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the Chair of the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee be and hereby is
requested to schedule a meeting to discuss parking options for City and School
employees who do not get jobs that come with parking; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the Transportation and Public Utilities Committee be and hereby is requested to
