Re:

Policy Order POR 2021 #23 dated February 8, 2021 re ‘hostile architecture’ in
public spaces and approach to ensuring that existing bench fixtures and public
seating supports all residents who use them

‘Defensive design’, sometimes called ‘hostile architecture’ are strategies used in the
design of public spaces and public amenities to guide or restrict behavior. While
typically intended to create safety, these can sometimes create exclusionary results.
Common examples include benches with armrests positioned to stop people from lying
down, ledges with metal clamps to prevent skateboarding, and handrails with spikes
preventing users from sliding down.
By limiting the use of a space, such measures disproportionately impact people who rely
more on public space, including the unhoused. However, depending on context and use
of the space, certain design interventions, which may be viewed as hostile, may serve a
positive public health and safety function. For instance, bollards, which may seem like a
barrier, generally serve as an important safety measure to separate vehicular traffic
from pedestrian spaces. It is, therefore, important to consider site conditions and user
perspectives from both a safety and inclusion perspective. For example, a well-designed
plaza may include a mix of benches with and without armrests. This variety would allow
people to lay down and rest while also providing arm support to those that need
assistance raising or lowering themselves. We note that the City’s standard benches
now used by the Department of Public Works are 6 feet long with arm rests at the ends.
They do not include middle arm rests and are accommodating to all users.

To formalize principles for inclusion in design while balancing different public space
goals, the Community Development Department is starting a process to develop Public
Realm Design Guidelines. These guidelines will recommend principles for creating high
quality public spaces that encourage pedestrian activity, provide public amenities,
promote social interaction, and create a welcoming environment. The guidelines will
include design principles for creating inclusive public spaces; recommendations on
universally accessible and welcoming street furniture; and streetscape standards for
public spaces in Cambridge, including sidewalks, plazas, and parks. The City will use
these to guide design of new public space – both City-owned spaces and privately
owned public spaces. We also expect the guidelines to be an important tool when
existing spaces are being redesigned to make any needed changes to ensure that public
spaces in Cambridge are welcoming and inclusive to all.

The Department of Public Works has
begun a survey of all those benches the
city is responsible for, be it in parks, in
squares, at bus stops or along various
streets throughout the city. Preliminary
counts indicate that there are in excess of
600 hundred benches citywide. Of those
that we have surveyed thus far,
approximately 1/3 have bars across the
middle that divide the bench in half. The
majority of these appear to be easily
modified to allow for the bar to be fully
removed and/or relocated.
In some of the older model benches the bars
were part of the original design making them
impossible to modify. In those case we will
evaluate the need for full bench replacement
or look to relocate benches to locations where
there are other options available to people and
ensure that the benches suit the location and
adequately provide an inclusive space for
neighbors and visitors.

While the Department of Public Works has
already begun removing bars from benches in
various locations in parks and elsewhere, in
furtherance of the council order request DPW
will work with the Department of Human
Services, the Commission for Persons with
Disabilities and the Council on Aging, and
other relevant departments as we move
through this evaluation and
relocation/removal and replacement process.

Update on Discussions of Allowing Multifamily Housing Citywide

To the Honorable, the City Council,
Since January, 2022, the Planning Board has held three discussions on the topic of allowing
multifamily housing in all zoning districts of Cambridge. These discussions were initiated by a
City Council request made on November 16, 2021, for “CDD to work with the Planning Board to
develop concepts and principles to eliminate single family and two family only zones in the City
of Cambridge, and to report back to the City Council as soon as practicable.”
Over the course of these discussions, staff from the Community Development Department
(CDD) presented information about Cambridge’s current zoning requirements and the specific
ways in which those requirements prevent multifamily housing in different parts of the city.
CDD also presented information about the issues and goals articulated in the Envision
Cambridge comprehensive plan and how they relate to the subject of restrictive single-family
and two-family zoning districts.
After the most recent discussion, the Board voted to send a report to the City Council with an
update on its process so far and a request for further guidance from the Council on the intended
policy goals and outcomes of a zoning change that would eliminate single and two-family only
zoning and permit multifamily housing citywide.
Below is an update on the Board’s discussion to date.
Zoning Principles
The Board’s discussion raised several important planning issues, which highlight the need for
clear policy guidance in order to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of different zoning strategies.
They reflect the range of viewpoints expressed by Board members.
•

Zoning should allow for an equitable range of housing types and unit sizes in all
residential districts. In other words, some neighborhoods should not be exclusively
limited to large, single-family and two-family homes while other neighborhoods allow
more variety in housing types. There is no compelling reason to prohibit multifamily
housing and townhouses throughout the city.

PLANNING BOARD

1.6.a

•

More housing opportunities could be created in restrictive zoning districts, which
currently do not support as much housing as other neighborhoods of the city. New
housing opportunities in residential neighborhoods should be viewed in the context of the
City’s overall strategy for housing growth, as articulated in Envision Cambridge.

•

Residential neighborhoods should have open space for children and families, as well as
tree canopy and other features that have a larger environmental benefit to the public as
well as residents. However, that should not necessarily be a justification to oppose the
creation of any new housing opportunities.

•

Neighborhood streets should not be overburdened with parking. Although there is a
desire to plan for a future that is less reliant on private automobile use, the impacts on
public resources, including on-street parking, need to be considered.

•

Housing costs are a major concern. Some Board members noted that new market-rate
housing units are likely to be very expensive and accessible only to wealthier households,
and that a change to allow multifamily housing throughout the City, in isolation, would
not produce new affordable housing units. Other Board members noted that housing is
already expensive, whether it is existing or new, and that retaining the current restrictive
zoning in some neighborhoods would result in fewer units that will still be out of reach to
all but the wealthiest households. Board members also acknowledged that demand for
housing has led to increased property values, placing pressure on longtime residents.

•

Opportunities to create affordable housing are desired. Changes to zoning should be
carefully assessed for how they might affect the viability of opportunities pursued under
the Affordable Housing Overlay.

•

It is worthwhile to identify and preserve building exteriors that contribute positively to
the architectural character of a neighborhood. However, there can be flexibility to make
changes within the interiors of buildings and develop complementary infill.

Concepts for Amending Zoning
Board members agreed that in order to enable multifamily housing citywide, it would be
necessary both to increase the allowed range of housing types in Residence A-1, A-2, and B
districts, and to amend the “minimum lot area per dwelling unit” requirements which currently
limit housing in those districts to fewer, larger-sized units.
•

Allowing More Housing Types: There is broad support for allowing multifamily and
townhouse development in Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts. Planning Board members
discussed the following specific options:
o Allow the same range of uses as in Residence C and C-1 districts. These would
include multifamily, townhouse, and some group housing such as elderly
congregate housing and lodging houses. Board members had differing views on

whether to allow group housing, noting that they can provide more affordable
alternative housing options, but can also have parking impacts.
o Allow a broader range of uses, but with limitations on building size. This would
allow for additional unit types while keeping building sizes consistent with the
prevailing neighborhood patterns.
o Allow multiple buildings on a lot. Currently, only a single principal building is
allowed per lot in Residence A-1 and A-2 districts, and there are some limitations
on detached buildings on a lot in Residence B. Allowing more flexibility would
allow for different building and site development options that could be tailored to
different sites.
•

Recalibrating Unit Density: Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts have higher ratios of
allowed floor area to allowed number of units than other zoning districts. There is broad
support for changing the limitations so that more units could be allowed in those districts
within the same amount of floor area. Planning Board members discussed the following
specific options:
o Reduce the minimum lot area per dwelling unit in those districts so that, when
combined with floor area ratio (FAR) limitations in that district, it results in a
consistent average unit size across neighborhoods. Some Board members
suggested that an average Gross Floor Area per dwelling unit of 1,200 square feet
could be a consistent standard across neighborhoods.
o Instead of lot area per dwelling unit limitations, rely on other limitations such as
allowed building types (such as three-unit, four-unit, six-unit buildings) without
specific limitations on unit density.

Board members discussed other zoning requirements that could be changed, but would likely
require more extensive study that could delay the implementation of the immediate objective of
allowing multifamily housing citywide.
•

Parking: The requirement to provide parking affects the feasibility of housing
production, but also impacts the availability of public on-street parking. Board members
are aware that the City Council and CDD are studying parking policies more broadly, and
the outcome is likely to affect any discussions related to housing.

•

Dimensional Standards: Dimensional requirements such as height, setbacks, and open
space can affect housing development. Because they interact in complex ways, it would
require exhaustive study to evaluate options for changing them and what outcomes would
likely result. Overall, Board members were supportive of retaining requirements for
setbacks and open space, though the specific requirements could be studied further and
adjusted if desired. Some Board members discussed whether changes in allowed height
could provide more open space, while others appreciated the consistency of the 35-foot
height limit across neighborhoods.

1.6.a

•

Affordability: It is very difficult to create affordability requirements that are both
effective and legally enforceable. However, Board members emphasized that it is
important to continue working toward possible strategies that could increase the supply of
affordable housing in all neighborhoods.

•

Broader Housing Production: Some Board members suggested taking a more holistic
view of the housing goals of Envision Cambridge, such as looking at whether more
housing can be permitted in transit-served areas. These ideas may be worthwhile to
discuss, but would be somewhat different than the current discussion, which is focused
on a citywide approach to eliminating zoning that restricts certain types of housing in
certain areas. If the Council’s policy goal is to create new housing opportunities more
broadly, it may be worthwhile to look beyond only the most restrictive residential
districts.

Next Steps
The Board welcomes input from the City Council on specific policy objectives that would help
to further refine the zoning concepts under discussion. With that guidance, CDD and the
Planning Board can further pursue options for zoning changes that would meet the stated
objectives.
Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am writing to provide you with an update on the MassAve4 project and am asking for your
approval for the approach and timeline for implementing separated bike lanes on these critical
segments of Massachusetts Avenue, as outlined in the attached report and summarized below.
The Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) identified four segments of Massachusetts Avenue where
installing separated bike lanes is challenging due to unique complicating factors, which include
the MBTA’s overhead bus wires, the median and major bus stops. The four segments are
collectively referred to as the MassAve4. The CSO requires that the City Manager and City
Council approve a recommended approach and timeline by May 1, 2022 or separated bike lanes
are required to be installed via quick-build methods.
Recommendation – The recommendation is to
implement separated bike lanes through partial
construction for the segments of Massachusetts
Avenue with the overhead MBTA bus wires and
median (Segments A and B) and full construction
for the Harvard Square bus stops (Segments C and
D). These recommendations were developed through
an extensive community engagement process including
two well-attended virtual meetings, five in person popup events, an on-line survey and review meetings with
the City’s Bike, Pedestrian and Transit Advisory
Committees. City staff, including the Economic
Development Division of the Community Development Department, have also been meeting
with local businesses, business groups, the Commission for Persons with Disabilities and
neighborhood associations to review the Cycling Safety Ordinance. A full summary of the
community engagement process is included in the attached report.
Through the community engagement process, City staff heard strong support for the small
businesses that are a key piece of what makes this corridor so special. The recommended
construction approach removes the median and allows the separated bike lanes to be
implemented and one side of parking to be maintained (if the MBTA overhead bus wires are also
removed). This ability to maintain 40 to 50% of curb uses such as accessible parking, customer
parking, loading, and outdoor dining is one of the key drivers behind the recommendation to
move forward with construction and was strongly supported by the community.

The timeline for completion of the improvements is based on the best available information. As
we work with the community to develop the detailed designs, we will have more information on
the full scope of the projects and also develop a strategy for how best to phase the improvements
to mitigate the impacts of construction. The estimated budget for these projects ($40M for
Segments A & B and $15M for Segments C & D) is being included in the recommended budget
that will be forwarded to the City Council in May.
Status of MBTA Overhead Bus Wires – The MBTA has discontinued the electric trolley
buses, de-energized the overhead bus wires, and appropriated $25,000,000 for the renovations of
the bus facility at Trolley Square to support the Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) that will be
replacing the electric trolley buses. As part of these renovations, the MBTA has committed to
removing the entirety of the overhead system (wires, poles and electrical conduit), but is
currently scoping the work to determine what portions will be completed with in-house crews
and what portions will need to be contracted out. City staff is meeting regularly with the MBTA
to coordinate on our various projects; however, the timeline for the removal of the system is not
yet finalized.
Annual Updates – Beginning in 2023, City staff will provide an annual update on the status of
the MassAve4 projects as part of the annual report to City Council on the implementation of the
Cycling Safety Ordinance.

OVERVIEW

2.2.b

Overview
Mass Ave Segments

The Cycling Safety Ordinance identifies four
segments of Massachusetts Avenue where installing
separated bike lanes is challenging due to unique
complicating factors, which include significant
underground utilities, major bus stops, a center
median, and the MBTA’s overhead bus wires.

Segments A & B include overhead wires that power
trolley buses and provide access to the MBTA’s bus
facility at the north end of the study area. These
overhead wires cause access issues for the Fire
Department, as separated bike lanes with parking
would no longer allow fire trucks to set up under
the wires as they do today. The existence of a center
median in these segments also presents challenges
for emergency response vehicles traveling down the
corridor and limits the ability for travel lanes to be
removed in order to provide parking regardless of
whether the overhead wires are removed.

The four segments, collectively referred to as the
MassAve4 project, are defined as follows:
• Dudley Street to Beech Street (A);
• Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B);
• Church Street to Garden Street (C); and
• Plympton Street to Dunster Street (D).

Segments C & D include busy bus stop areas in
Harvard Square where several MBTA bus routes,
as well as Harvard and MASCO shuttles, pick up
and drop off passengers. Several buses also need
to layover or wait between their last stop and first
stop at these locations. As a result, the typical quick
build solutions used at less busy bus stops are not
appropriate.

The City published an impact analysis on the
MassAve4 project in April 2021. This City Council
report summarizes the continued analysis and
community engagement completed since the initial
MassAve4 impact analysis. It evaluates potential
street layouts, and the resulting recommendations,
estimated costs, and proposed timelines for
implementation. The Cycling Safety Ordinance
(CSO) requires the City Council to approve the
recommended approach and timeline by May 1, 2022.

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

Mass Ave: Segments A & B
Dudley Street to Beech Street (A) & Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B)
In Segments A and B, Mass Ave generally features
two travel lanes in each direction, painted bike lanes,
parking, and a concrete median. These segments
also include overhead bus wires that provide power
to trolley buses that travel Mass Ave to access the
MBTA bus facility at Dudley Street. In order to allow
for construction activity for projects in Cambridge
and Watertown, the MBTA has de-energized the
overhead wires along Mass Ave and other streets
for five years. Strategies are currently under
development to ultimately remove the wires and
replace the trolley buses with battery electric buses,
however, the timeline for the removal of the wires is
not yet finalized.
Mass Ave is an important multimodal street for
regional, commercial, and local trips. Approximately
1,100 bicyclists use the Mass Ave corridor during
peak periods. Currently, these segments of Mass Ave
serve three bus routes, providing service to up to
5,700 weekday passengers. These routes experience
significant delay during peak hours, as well as during
other hours of the day. Several intersections along

these segments of Mass Ave feature traffic signals to
help facilitate pedestrian crossings and movements
from side streets. Many of these traffic signals are
located on the median. There are also crosswalks
that are controlled by pedestrian activated flashing
beacons, where the median serves as a crossing
island, providing a safe place for pedestrians
to wait after crossing two lanes of traffic. Some
intersections also provide dedicated vehicle turn
lanes where additional vehicular capacity may be
required.
The curb lane serves different purposes along the
corridor, including parking, commercial loading, bus
stops, and outdoor dining. These existing curbside
uses support the small businesses along Mass Ave
as well as the surrounding neighborhood. Mass Ave
is also a critical utility corridor, providing services
for residents and businesses along Mass Ave and the
broader neighborhood and community. Construction
impacts associated with different design alternatives
and opportunities for utility improvements were
explored at a high level to help evaluate options.

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

Mass Ave: Segments A & B
Dudley Street to Beech Street (A) & Roseland Street to Waterhouse Street (B)
Three levels of construction were evaluated for
Segments A & B of Mass Ave. Quick build maintains
all existing sidewalks and medians, and implements
separated bike lanes with paint and flex post
barriers. Partial construction would remove the
center median – except at key pedestrian crossing
locations – and sidewalks would remain as they are
today. Full construction involves reconstructing all
of the street infrastructure, including sidewalks and
underground utilities, and provides the opportunity to
construct sidewalk level separated bike lanes, where
feasible.

on both sides while maintaining two travel lanes in
each direction. Parking could change sides along the
corridor where needed. The exact location of parking,
commercial loading, and outdoor dining will be
determined in later stages of design. Opportunities to
provide additional parking on side streets will also be
explored during future project stages.
Potential impacts related to utilities, signals, and
curbside uses were examined at a high level for each
construction scenario to help compare and evaluate
options. A summary of the three construction
scenarios and their impacts is provided below.

If the median and overhead wires are removed,
parking could be provided on one side of the corridor,
but there is not enough space to provide parking

QUICK BUILD (NOT RECOMMENDED)

• Flex-post bike lane separation

• Lowest impact on utilities

• 0-5% parking maintained (accessible spaces
only)

• Shorter implementation timeline (1-2 years)
• Lower overall cost (< $2 million)

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS A & B

PARTIAL CONSTRUCTION (RECOMMENDED)

• Flex post or curbed bike lane separation

• No sidewalk upgrades or reconstruction, except
for accessible curb ramps

• Median removed, but upgraded at pedestrian
crossings

• 40-50% parking possible to maintain on one side
of the street if overhead wires are removed

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes and
improvements at bus stops

• Medium implementation timeline (4-6 years)

• Upgrades to affected utilities

• Medium cost (approximately $40 million)

FULL CONSTRUCTION (NOT RECOMMENDED)

• Opportunity to provide raised separated bike
lanes

• Major utility upgrades
• 40-50% parking possible to maintain on one side
of the street if overhead wires are removed

• Median removed but upgraded at pedestrian
crossings

• Longer design and implementation timeline (up to
10 years)

• Sidewalk reconstruction and new plantings/
amenities

• Higher cost ($100s of millions)

• Can accommodate dedicated bus lanes and other
transit improvements

MASS AVE: SEGMENTS C & D

Mass Ave: Segments C & D
Church Street to Garden Street (C) & Plympton Street to Dunster Street (D)
Several MBTA bus routes and shuttles servicing
Harvard and the Longwood Medical Area use the
existing stops at Johnston Gate and Holyoke Street.
Over 2,800 MBTA bus riders use the Holyoke stop
on weekdays. The majority of riders exit the bus
here, while bus operators wait to start return trips
to Kendall, Lechmere, or Nubian Square in Boston.
Approximately 800 passengers use the Johnston
Gate stop daily, most of whom are using this stop to
board the bus. The existing bike lanes in this area
are located between the travel lanes and the areas
where buses pull over to service stops.

however, buses share space with bikes at bus
stops. Options to utilize temporary bus islands
to expand bus stop areas past the curb present
accessibility and maintenance challenges and would
not accommodate the high number of bus riders and
bicyclists in these areas. They may also conflict with
existing utilities and are therefore not preferred.
Full construction will allow for bike lanes to be
raised to sidewalk level and for bus stop islands
to be placed next to the curb to reduce conflicts
between bicyclists and boarding or alighting
passengers at each stop.

Two levels of construction were evaluated for
Segments C & D of Mass Ave. Quick build bike lanes
use paint and flex posts to provide separation,

is estimated to cost approximately $15 million.

Due to heavy bus stop activity and the need for bus
layovers, quick build bike lanes are not recommended
for Segments C & D. Full construction is
recommended for Mass Ave between Plympton Street
and Garden Street, as highlighted below, to ensure

Segments A & B

Partial Construction

Partial Construction is recommended for Segments A
& B, as it best meets the needs of the community while
also offering a shorter implementation timeline than
full construction.

Full Construction

Some small segments in constrained areas may
require full construction such as the Walden Street
intersection, which has been considered in the
proposed cost and timeline estimates.

Segments C & D
Full Construction is recommended between Plympton
Street and Garden Street to provide safe and
comfortable facilities for all users through these high
volume bus stop areas.

design specifics for each segment. The community will
have multiple ways to provide feedback on the segment
designs through engagement opportunities such as popup events and community meetings. Implementation will
be phased along with other major construction projects
in the city to reduce disruptions during construction.

The schedule and cost estimates provided in this report
are based on the information available at this time.
Detailed construction phasing will be further developed
as the design progresses and we understand more about
the scope of the improvements and impacts on utilities.

What drives our street design?
Many policies and plans are foundational to our work
• Cycling Safety Ordinance, Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance,
Cambridge Growth Policy, Complete Streets Policy, Vision Zero Policy,
Climate Protection Plan and others

We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible bike lanes that can be used by a wide range of people
• Streets that are safe and accessible for all abilities

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

3

Project Background
• Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires
separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
• For MassAve4 - by April 30, 2022 the City must:
• Present analysis on which sections can be quick-build or
construction
• Obtain approval from the City Council on a construction
timeline for separated bike lane sections not recommended
for quick-build

• Any sections recommended for quick-build must
be installed by April 30, 2023
• If a timeline is not approved by the City Council for
sections recommended for construction, those
sections must be quick-build and installed by
April 30, 2024

Existing Roadway Configuration
• Includes two travel lanes, painted bike lanes, and parking on each
side as well as a concrete median
• Overhead bus wires run along the outside (right) travel lanes to
allow trolley buses to access the MBTA garage. These 600-volt
overhead wires constrain the ability to do construction, and create
challenges for fire access

Fire Access
• Ladder truck's position in relation to the overhead bus wires
• Ladder truck is set up in bike lane as close to the curb as possible
• Allows the ladder to be safely positioned under the overhead bus
wires and reach all levels of multi-story buildings
• Under certain fire conditions, the ladder truck is also used to
provide aerial roof access to lower story buildings

Quick-Build
• Quick-build projects use pavement markings, flexposts, signs, and signal changes
• Allow reallocating the roadway space between the
existing curbs
• Can be implemented quickly due to no
construction

17

Quick-Build Considerations
• Consider retaining parking and removing a travel lane
• The overhead bus wires create significant challenges
• Typical floating parking would place a fire truck in what is
now the inside (left) lane. This does not allow the ladder to
reach all levels of multi-story buildings.

Quick-Build Considerations
• Consider retaining parking and removing a travel lane
• Due to the existing median, a single travel lane
would not provide adequate road width for vehicles to move
to allow emergency vehicles to pass
• Significant additional delay for transit

19

Reconstruction
• Construction projects involve more extensive changes
such as moving curbs, relocating or upgrading
utilities, and incorporating landscaping/green
infrastructure
• Would require significant changes to the overhead
bus wires
• Allows reconfiguring the right of way space available
between buildings

Reconstruction Considerations
• Full reconstruction projects
offer many benefits, but take
years to design and implement
• Consider partial reconstruction
options that limit impacts to
reduce project timeline
• Removal of center median while
maintaining outside curbs
• Relocation or removal of
conflicting utilities (signal
equipment, etc.)

• Would require changes to
the overhead bus wires
21

Reconstruction Considerations
• Full and partial reconstruction
projects must consider the
condition of existing utilities
and the impact of construction
on those utilities
• Responsibility not to
compromise existing utilities
• Opportunity to
address deteriorated
infrastructure
• Complexity of existing utilities
can make "small changes"
more complicated than
anticipated

MassAve4 Engagement – Phase 1 (November 2021)
Overview
To provide information and obtain feedback on the MassAve4 Cycling Safety Ordinance Project (MassAve4), the City of
Cambridge used a multi-pronged strategy involving both digital and in-person outreach. The project website –
https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/publicworks/cityprojects/2021/massave4cyclingsafetyordinanceprojectdu
dleytobeach,roselandtowaterhouse - includes:
•
•
•
•

Links to public engagement materials
An online survey used to obtain feedback
A 12-minute video providing a comprehensive overview of MassAve4
Contact information for a City representative

Some of this information was also available on a flyer that was distributed in the project area and which advertised the
engagement events that took place in November 2021. These engagement events took place at two locations –St. John’s
Church at 2252 Mass Ave, and on the Cambridge Common at Waterhouse Street and Mass Ave – on Saturday,
November 13th (both locations), Monday, November 15th (St. John’s only) and Tuesday, November 16th (Cambridge
Common only). Visitors to the events had several opportunities to learn about MassAve4 and provide feedback. They
could:
•
•
•

Speak with City officials and project team members
View project opportunities, displayed on a tabletop map and poster boards, and provide feedback by indicating
interest with a sticker or a written comment
Fill out and return paper copies of the project survey (these responses were later uploaded to be included along
with the digital responses)

The posters grouped opportunities into the following categories:
•
•
•

Quick-build (no construction or changes to the curb)
Partial-build (some construction, such as removal of the median or interventions regarding the overhead wires)
Full reconstruction (construction/changes to the curb involved)

After the first day of engagement, it was determined an additional board relating specifically to parking would be
beneficial, and this board was available at the final two
sessions on Monday and Tuesday.

Key Findings

THE TWO MOST PROMINENT THEMES FROM

The majority of recorded feedback received, by volume,
was via the dot stickers placed on poster boards. While
the color of these dot stickers was not intended to have
meaning, some participants indicated that they used red
dots to indicate they opposed something and green dots
if they supported something. As such, the number of dots
placed next to each opportunity is not necessarily a good
measure of support, but rather of interest, whether
positive or negative.

THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT RESULTS ARE
IMPROVING INTERMODAL SAFETY AND
PRESERVING ACCESS TO LOCAL BUSINESSES,
SEEN AS THE HEART OF MASS AVE. A DESIGN
MUST INCORPORATE THESE THEMES,
BALANCING THE NEEDS ACROSS DIFFERENT
MODES, AS DRIVING, WALKING, BIKING AND

Takeaways from Boards
• Bike lanes generated the most interest

TAKING TRANSIT ARE ALL COMMON.

•
•

Customer and short-term parking received the most dots of any parking categories
Transit- and utility-focused opportunities received relatively less interest

Takeaways from Map Comments
• Numerous crosswalks and areas of the existing bike lane were identified as dangerous
• The most noted specific location is the area of westbound Mass Ave near Walden where the bike lane
disappears
• General comments indicated:
o Support for keeping parking for businesses;
o Support for separated bike lanes; and
o Concern for the ability of the street to serve the elderly and disabled
Takeaways from Surveys
Multiple choice survey questions asked respondents how they traveled on and otherwise used Mass Ave, while openended questions asked about favorite aspects of Mass Ave, challenging locations, and locations that work well. There
was also a fully open-ended question where respondents could leave additional comments. Multiple choice questions
were sorted by answer, while open-ended responses were analyzed and placed into categories based on the general
concern of the comment (and not necessarily whether the comment was in support or opposition).
•

•

•

Driving and walking were the most popular modes, at 78% and 76% respectively, with biking third at 50% of
respondents
The most popular other uses of Mass Ave were overwhelmingly shopping and dining, at 86% and 84%
respectively
o This sentiment was echoed in the open-ended responses to “favorite thing on Mass Ave,” where 81%
mentioned something related to shopping or business
Biking was the most common topic referenced for both what is challenging on Mass Ave and what works well
on Mass Ave. In general, respondents found areas without separated bike lanes challenging and found areas
with separated bike lanes to work well.
In the remaining survey questions, the most common responses discussed aspects of biking, specific
intersections, or walking/pedestrian infrastructure

Common Themes
Across the multiple engagement formats, the following topics emerged as key themes:
•
•
•

Bike lanes
Parking for businesses
Improving pedestrian infrastructure, specifically at crosswalks

Separated Bike Lanes
and Floating Parking
Separated bike lanes will be
implemented as required by
ordinance. In a partial build
scenario, moving parking away from
the curb can help create a buffer
between cars and cyclists

Transit Facilities
These include transit-only lanes,
queue jump lanes, or transitspecific signals

Bus Stop
Improvements
Bus stop improvements, such as
installing transit shelters or seating

Off-peak Loading

Crossing Islands

Regulations can dedicate space for
loading for businesses on Mass Ave
during the off-peak hours

Enhanced crossing islands can
provide more comfortable and
accessible places of refuge for
pedestrians crossing Mass Ave

Pick-up/Drop-off
Zones
Providing spaces for taxis and
rideshares to pick up and drop off
passengers can keep these uses
from encroaching on parking or
bike lanes

Outdoor Dining
Parking spaces can be re-purposed
as outdoor dining

Center Median
Removal
Removing the center median in
certain places can allow space to
be reallocated to other uses

What drives our street design?
We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible facilities, including bike lanes, that can be used by a
wide range of people

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

Many policies and plans are foundational to our work
• 1) 1992 Cambridge Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, 2) 1993/2007
Cambridge Growth Policy, 3) 2016 Complete Streets Policy, 4) 2016 Vision
Zero Policy

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

3

Why Separated Bike Lanes?
• Fewer crashes
• Eliminates threat of “dooring” from
parked vehicles
• Buffer space reduces conflicts between
turning vehicles and people biking
• Shorter crossing distances for people
walking
• Increased comfort for people biking of
all ages and abilities
• Increased comfort for people driving as
they know where to expect people
biking
• Enables more people to choose cycling
as a transportation option
• Supports City’s climate goals

Project Background
• Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires
separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
• For MassAve4 - by April 30, 2022 the City must:
• Present analysis on which sections can be quick-build or
construction
• Obtain approval from the City Council on a construction
timeline for separated bike lane sections not recommended
for quick-build

• Any sections recommended for quick-build must
be installed by April 30, 2023
• If a timeline is not approved by the City Council for
sections recommended for construction, those
sections must be quick-build and installed by
April 30, 2024
5

Study Area
• There are many installed,
planned and ongoing
projects along Mass Ave
• This study is reviewing the
MassAve4 segments with
overhead wires, including:
• Dudley Street to Beech
Street
• Roseland Street to
Waterhouse Street

MBTA Overhead Wires
• Overhead wires power trackless
trolley buses along Mass Ave
• Overhead wires present design
challenges for access to
buildings by the fire department
• Design options must ensure no
conflicts between ladder trucks
and overhead wires

7

MBTA Overhead Wire Status
• Beginning March 2022, MBTA will de-energize the
overhead wires on Mass Ave for five years to accommodate
construction projects in Cambridge and Watertown
• MBTA is proposing to convert the trolley buses to Battery
Electric Buses (BEBs) and remove the overhead wires. The
timeline for removal is currently unknown
• Removing the overhead wires provides significantly more
flexibility for design options

Design Opportunities
• Recall the three levels of
construction that could be
considered:
1. Quick Build – paint and flex
posts, maintain median and
sidewalks
2. Partial Construction –
removal of center median,
paving and upgrades to
affected utilities
3. Full Construction – median
removal, street/sidewalk
reconstruction and full utility
upgrades

Feasibility Considerations
• There are many possible configurations for Mass
Ave based on the available space
• For these segments of Mass Ave, special
consideration for emergency and fire access is
required due to the median and overhead wires
• Other considerations include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Safety for people walking
Safety for people biking
Transit efficiency
Parking/curbside access for businesses
Utility impacts
Implementation timeline

15

Infeasible Options
• Several options were reviewed but deemed
infeasible and therefore not advanced:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Parking along the median
Bike or bus lanes along the median
Two-way bike lane on one side
Wider landscaped median
One lane and parking on each side with median
Two lanes and parking on each side without median

• These options do not:
• Allow for safe and intuitive use of the street by all users;
• Allow emergency services to travel down the corridor
and access buildings unimpeded; and/or
• Fit within the available space.

What drives our street design?
Many policies and plans are foundational to our work
• Cycling Safety Ordinance, Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance,
Cambridge Growth Policy, Complete Streets Policy, Vision Zero Policy,
Climate Protection Plan and others

We design for people of ALL ages and abilities. This
means including:
• People who many not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible bike lanes that can be used by a wide range of people
• Streets that are safe and accessible for all abilities

Focus is on moving people and goods, not their vehicles
• Buses run less frequently than cars and carry more people
• Cannot ignore access for trucks and local deliveries

How we think about vehicle congestion and delay
• Moving people slowly is moving people safely
• We do not prioritize eliminating delay for people driving alone

15

Why Separated Bike Lanes?
• Fewer crashes
• Eliminates threat of “dooring” from
parked vehicles
• Buffer space reduces conflicts between
turning vehicles and people biking
• Shorter crossing distances for people
walking
• Increased comfort for people of all
ages and abilities who are biking
• Increased comfort for people driving as
they know where to expect people
biking
• Enables more people to choose cycling
as a transportation option
• Supports City’s climate goals
• Supports Public Health goals

Quick Build vs Construction
• Quick build bike lanes use
paint and flex posts to

• Temporary bus islands
expand bus stop area past
the curb
• May conflict with utilities
• Present accessibility and
maintenance issues
• Would not accommodate the
high number of bus riders and
cyclists in this area

27

Quick Build vs Construction
• Construction allows for bike
lanes to be raised and for
bus stop islands to be placed
next to the curb
• Due to heavy bus activity and
need for layovers, quick
build bike lanes are not
recommended
• Construction is

MassAve4 Engagement – Phase 2 (February-March 2022)
Overview
The City of Cambridge conducted Phase 2 of public engagement for the MassAve4 Cycling Safety Ordinance Project
(MassAve4) in February and March 2022, as a follow up to Phase 1 (November 2021). In Phase 1, public feedback was
obtained through both virtual and in-person public outreach and was used to develop an evaluation framework for the
possible design options – including Quick-Build, Partial Construction, and Full Construction scenarios. The project team
evaluated the feasibility of the design options to develop design recommendations based on community feedback from
Phase 1.
For Phase 2 of public engagement, the City continued its multi-pronged approach to obtain feedback on the draft
recommendations and to understand if the project team missed any important considerations in the evaluation process.
Over 19,000 postcards (attached) were distributed to residents and businesses to notify the community of the public
meeting schedule. Phase 2 focused on all four segments of the MassAve4 project and the respective design
recommendations:
•
•

Partial Construction for Segments A&B (Dudley to Beech and Roseland to Waterhouse)
Full Construction for Segments C&D (Church to Garden and Plympton to Dunster)

Phase 2 consisted of both virtual and in-person opportunities to provide input on the proposed recommendations,
including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

MassAve4 (A&B) Presentation to the City of Cambridge’s Joint Bike/Pedestrian/Transit Advisory Committee
(Tri Committee) – February 16, 2022 (Virtual)
MassAve4 (A&B) Community Meeting – March 3, 2022 (Virtual)
MassAve4 (C&D) Community Meeting – March 10, 2022 (Virtual)
MassAve4 in-person pop-up event (all four segments) – March 22, 2022 (in-person outside Lesley
University’s Lunder Arts Center)
An online survey
Direct emails to DPW with comments and questions prior to the virtual meetings

To ensure community-informed recommendations to the Cambridge City Council, the project team asked for feedback
through two questions:
1. Did we miss anything?
2. What are your thoughts about our recommendations to proceed with Partial Construction for Segments A&B,
and Full Construction for Segments C&D?

Key Findings
Through the Phase 2 engagement process, the City continued to work with community stakeholders to confirm the
technical viability of the design recommendations, while obtaining overall public support for Partial Construction for
A&B and Full Construction for C&D through public outreach. These design recommendations meet the goals of the
Cambridge Cycling Ordinance (CSO) while recognizing the community’s desires to improve intermodal safety and
preserve access to local businesses – themes that have been expressed throughout both phases of the public
engagement process. The public had questions and concerns regarding specific locations and design elements, however,
the City reminded the community that the project is still in the feasibility phase. The City will assess these specific
concerns in the design phase should the recommendation for Partial Construction gain approval from Cambridge City
Council.

The Tri Committee provided the project team with feedback on the proposed design approach for Segments A&B, while
the community meetings, pop-up event, and online surveys
provided opportunities for community members to voice their
Key Themes
opinions and ask questions. Key takeaways from each
➢ Community support for recommendations:
component of Phase 2 are included below:

o A&B: Partial Construction

Tri Committee Takeaways
o C&D: Full Construction
• While some stakeholders would like to see the changes
➢ Specific design concerns will be addressed in
made as fast as possible through Quick-Build,
the design phase
stakeholders expressed support for Partial Construction ➢ Stakeholders stress the need to prioritize
for A&B, as it meets the goals of the CSO, maintains
multimodal safety and access to parking for
more of the existing on-street parking than a Quick
local businesses
Build allows; and, improves pedestrian, bike, and transit
infrastructure.
• It was noted by some participants that Full Construction would meet more multimodal objectives, but
acknowledged it would take over 10 years to implement. Participants also expressed an understanding that
some roadway changes could have more significant impacts on sub-surface utilities so the Partial Construction
scenario allows for utilities to be accounted for as needed.
Community Meeting Takeaways
•

•

•

•

A key theme from the community meetings were questions and comments related to specific locations and
design elements. However, the project is in the feasibility phase and will not move forward until the Cambridge
City Council weighs in on the recommendation to proceed with a Partial Construction design option. City staff
reminded the public that specific design questions will be addressed in the subsequent design phase, and these
types of questions do not affect the overall feasibility of the build recommendations. Examples of questions
include:
o “How will loss of parking be identified?”
o “How will the City handle snow plowing on bike lanes?”
o “Will bike parking be expanded?”
Comment cards and poster comments demonstrate overall support for the build recommendations (Partial
Construction for A&B, Full Construction for C&D) over other build options.
o Both recommended options help increase safety for all users, while the Partial Construction
recommendation for A&B helps maintain sufficient parking for local businesses.
There were questions and comments regarding the prioritization of one mode of travel over another. The City
reiterated the goal is to move people as safely (not as quickly) as possible, balancing the needs of all roadway
users.
Questions related to transit, specifically MBTA buses and the overhead catenary wires, are part of the design
considerations for the project, as the project team is looking at all roadway users within the design
considerations – driving, transit, walking, biking.

Survey Takeaways
• Broad support for the Partial Construction recommendation for A&B – very few responses preferred the Quick
Build scenario. While some would prefer Full Construction, they view Partial Construction as a good
compromise.
• Continued concern was expressed from Phase 1 engagement regarding impacts to local businesses, especially
relating to availability of on-street parking

•

Some community members expressed concerns with the overall process, believing that they need to know more
about potential impacts before supporting the recommendations for Partial Construction for A&B and Full
Construction for C&D

Common Themes
Across multiple engagement formats, the following emerged as common themes:
•
•

Support for the draft recommendation of Partial Construction for Segments A&B and Full Construction for
Segment D over the other build options
Within the context of the overall support for the draft recommendations, the public feedback heard in Phase 2
emphasized the importance of considering the following elements as part of the design process:
o Providing parking to support local businesses
o Improving bike and pedestrian safety
o Finding a balance between all modes of travel when implementing separated bike lanes

Project Background
Our Street
Design Principles
Mass Ave safety improvements are based
on two key principles:
Designing for people of ALL ages and
abilities, including:
• People who may not have access to a car
• Safe and accessible facilities, including bike lanes,
that can be used by a wide range of people

Rethinking vehicle congestion and delay

Backed by Policy
Many other multimodal safety policies
and plans—including the Cycling Safety
Ordinance—led to this project:
1. Cambridge Vehicle Trip Reduction
Ordinance (1992)
2. Cambridge Growth Policy (1993/2007)
3. Complete Streets Policy (2016)
4. Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance

• Slow movement is safe movement

5. Parking & Transportation Demand Ordinance

• Eliminating delay for people driving alone is not
the top priority

6. Climate Protection Plan

• Move people and goods, not their vehicles

8. School Wellness Policy

7. Growth Policy Document Update

Cycling Safety Ordinance (2020)
• Requires the installation of separated bike lanes in certain
parts of the city
• Set deadline of April 30 for quick-build projects on
Mass Ave – Porter Square is the only remaining
quick-build project on Mass Ave

Porter Square versus Mass4
Porter Square and the Mass4 are separate projects. The
Mass4 are four sections of Mass Ave that will get separated
bike lanes but on a slightly longer timeframe. Porter Square
from Roseland St to Beech St is not part of the Mass4.

Design Opportunities

Project Background
Cambridge Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires separated bike lanes along Mass Ave
There are four segments of Mass Ave where implementing quick build bike lanes would be more
challenging due to complicating factors, such as overhead wires and busy bus stops. These segments are
referred to as the MassAve4.

Recall the three levels of construction
that could be considered:
1. Quick Build – paint and flex posts,
maintain median and sidewalks
Quick Build

Construction Level

Requirement

Quick Build

Installation by April 30, 2023

Construction

Obtain approval from City Council on
construction timeline for separated
bike lanes

If timeline not approved, sections
must be quick-build and installed
by April 30, 2024

2. Partial Construction – removal of
center median, paving and upgrades
to affected utilities
Partial Construction

Next Steps
• Community feedback on DRAFT recommendations
• With City Council approval, additional public engagement as detailed designs developed

3. Full Construction – median removal,
street/sidewalk reconstruction and
full utility upgrades

Recommendation: Partial Construction
• Based on community feedback and the
analysis completed, the Partial Construction
option of removing the median is
recommended
• This option meets CSO goals, can maintain up
to 40-50% of existing parking
(if overhead wires are removed)
and allows for improvements
for people walking, biking and
taking the bus

QUICK BUILD

Quick Build vs Construction

Massachusetts Ave

Quick build bike lanes use paint and flex posts to
provide separation
• Buses share space with bikes at bus stops
Temporary bus islands expand bus stop area past the
curb
• May conflict with utilities
• Present accessibility and maintenance issues
• Would not accommodate the high number of bus
riders and cyclists in this area

Construction allows for bike lanes to be raised and for
bus stop islands to be placed next to the curb
Due to heavy bus activity and need for layovers, quick
build bike lanes are not recommended
Construction is recommended between Plympton

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you Mr. clerk obviously there is a lot to cover.
on the agenda we are going to hear first from CDD. then we can have some clarifying questions from the
committee. we will then hear from Councillor Nolan with a presentation on the amendments that she wishes to
bring forward. we can have clarifying questions following that presentation. we will then hear from Councillor
Zondervan will present the green new deal amendments. we can ask questions after that. we will go to public
comment. and then if time will go into, we can have more discussion we sort of anticipate this is going to take
certainly more than one meeting to get through. so, this is going to be a process. we certainly will get everything
tonight. so, with that I think we should probably just jump right in and go to CDD. assistant manager.
>> Iram Farooq, assistant city manager of community development: thank you Councillor McGovern good
evening to the ordinance committee. it was a pleasure to be here. and we're actually really excited to be here to
be talking to you today about amendments to the building energy use disclosure ordinance these are long time in
the making. we've been working on this along with members of the community with the regulated community
as well. starting pre-pandemic and with some hold up over time. so, it's really nice to finally have the
recommendations before the ordinance committee. we firmly believe that adding emissions reductions
requirements to the building energy use disclosure ordinance is one of the most impactful ways to get us to net
zero greenhouse gas emissions as a community. and that is something that has been very much in the forefront
of the team as they worked on framing the recommendations. I note that there are multiple different opinions on
this. we welcome discussion on the various ideas.

but I’m really happy to have the opportunity to talk you about the genesis of the specifics that are in the
proposal that has come out of the work following the net zero action plan. I will say that our presentation which

will be given by the spec is largely the same as the presentation as the health and environment committee in
December.

>> Seth Federspiel, sustainability planner: thank you very much. I will pull up the presentation. those full
screen side coming through for everyone? great. thanks very much for having me this evening. as the assistant
city manager said apologize to those of you from this will be familiar presentation print but I think again it's
helpful way to get everybody on the same page. in terms of where we are with this process. I’m going to move
through this pretty quickly so that we can get to the other presentations and discussion I’m certainly happy to
answer questions as we go. alright so I’m going to briefly discuss the context in the background for the building
energy disclosure ordinance pursuant to current amendments talk about the process and getting to those
amendments.
I will focus most of the presentation on reviewing the content of the amendments themselves as proposed by
CDD and the city manager back in November. so, as we were said the reason we are focused on building and
reducing billing greenhouse gas emissions because buildings play such a large role in our venous gas inventory.
so, in order to be successful in meeting our climate change goals is imperative to reduce emissions from
buildings in Cambridge and when we look at BEUDO building specifically BEUDO applies to commercial
buildings that a larger than 25,000 ft. in residential buildings larger than 50 units. these buildings have quite a
few. never.
sorry about that. but they count for about 60% of the square footage of the city. and the energy use and almost
70% of the greenhouse gas emissions of the building sector. so, 70% of that 80%. they come from buildings. the
reason greenhouse gas emissions are somewhat higher than energy is because of the amount of electricity used
by these buildings which has a slightly higher emissions factor then natural gas.
we mentioned the action plan I went to briefly place this proposal in context of the action plan the update which
was submitted to council a little bit earlier this year. the action plan is a comprehensive plan for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. and while BEUDO plays a very important piece of that. it is not the
only piece.
so, across the action plan which has actions for existing buildings the new buildings and the energy supply. we
have combination proposed requirements such as the country amendments but also a range of incentives and
support in enabling actions. so BEUDO again plays one piece of that. but in order for the net zero action plan to
be successful and to successfully meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals we need to activate all of these
actions together to address the full set of greenhouse gas emissions buildings in Cambridge.

mostly because the petition the text of the ordinance of the proposal is the same. however, I just want to make
sure that we do this since we are now in the formal ordinance process, and it would make sure that everybody's
interested is attending this hearing as an opportunity to hear the full scope of what is on the table. so, with that I
will just introduce. [listing names] we hear from me more department and had the law department was deftly
partner in framing for specifics of this to make sure that they pass muster, and it was turned over to. [listing
names] who is leads the net zero work at CDD. Seth over to you.

on the BEUDO process, BEUDO was adopted in 2014. included a provision that in 20 team we reviewed the
impact of BEUDO. that review process showed that the energy use of BEUDO buildings remained relatively
stable over the time of the ordinance. this again energy use which is distinct from greenhouse gas emissions or
have gone down slightly for BEUDO buildings. largely due to improvements in electricity degrades but
certainly this trend is not satisfying the significant improvement in energy performance called for by the
ordinance. so, this trigger then our process to consider what amendments the ordinance would look like.
so, to briefly review that process a process again in 2017 so we been working on it for number of years. in that
process centered largely around consultation with the actual BEUDO property owners to really understand with
them what the considerations are for improving energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions from those
buildings and to work towards developing a proposed approach that can work for the buildings and achieve
greenhouse gas emissions that we need to achieve.

and so, coming out of this process we had general support from the regulated community. about the
performance standards and assigned space targets that were established therein. there is a goal to establish
regulatory certainties so tried to get the policy figured out sooner rather than later. and a desire to balance
flexibility in the policy with simplicity and predictability again knowing what to expect going forward.

I advised reducing greenhouse gas emissions being able to have a lot of flexibility for how those reductions are
achieved so they can come from both on-site and off-site measures. the actual complaints and targets are on the
left-hand side, and it will go through those on the next slide. But based on those targets we base it on what the
sizes: four from the IPCC in terms of our 2050 net zero commitment.
in the interim targets between now and then. and then the other important aspect to understand here is that the
Cambridge proposal this is different than for example the Boston ordinance is setting targets relative to each
individuals buildings baseline. this really simplifies the approach.
by avoiding the need to calculate the universal target. by building type print it also gives us more certainty about
the outcome because we know that all of the buildings are reducing a certain percentage then the outcome is
that percentage reduction. in each building is then contributing a proportional amount of that percentage
reduction depending on where they are starting. so higher emitting building has two make a larger absolute
reduction. to make the same percentage as a more efficient building is a lower absolute reduction again at the
same percentage. so, this graph is visualizing what those thresholds look like overtime. and so again the oldworld trajectory put this on that science-based targeted net 0 by 2050 and we chose increments in five years. to
match up with the retrofit cycles that buildings will undertake. so, acknowledging that it takes time for buildings
to plan and implement retrofits. so that way we have these steps so the buildings have five years then they can
meet the steps for another five years as anticipated the next five years.
and because the baseline is consistent throughout any early action that is taken during any of the steps is given
credit for in the following steps prince of the building goes below 20% in the first . for example, the net
automatically credited towards the next complaints we met. the way we regulate complaints is like regulating
greenhouse gas emissions for each energy use in the building. multiplied by the appropriate emissions factor for
that energy use. we'll talk about that a little more at the next light. then there's also a provision that buildings can
take credit for alternative compliance credits. which are purchased and go to reinvest in greenhouse gas
emission reductions elsewhere in the city.
then renewable electricity which I’ll talk about in a second. it is also a part of the calculation and it subtracted
from the electricity use portion of the energy formula. so, the emission factors are important because emission
factors translate the amount of energy that the buildings are using to the emissions. for example, electricity
emissions change over time as the state and national electric grid for cleaner. so, we are in the process of
planning the stakeholder-based process to determine the emission factors in particular for the electrical grid
coming in looking backwards to the baseline and projecting forward so that buildings know what they can
expect to receive credit from the grid over the period of each compliance period.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

I’m going to jump into the actual proposal the proposed amendments were submitted to council back in
November of last year. this line summarizes them I’m going to go through these one by one. but it's you for
your reference. so of course, the center of the policy proposal is the actual performance requirements. and so,
point to note here is that the performance requirements are in greenhouse gas emissions breaks as opposed to
energy or another unit. and the reason for that do not have conversation with the property owners that are
preference for that unit of what we are regulating to match what we are trying to achieve.

we want to project forward five years of the time to give building that certainty. so, as the building went to
comply with the performance standard, they can take on-site emission reductions. by increasing their energy
efficiency by electrifying there and uses of energy in getting off fossil fuels. and by producing electricity
through on-site renewable sources. they can also purchase off-site renewable electricity. this applies to the
electrical use of the building. or they can purchase alternate complaints credits. basically, talk about each of
these. so, for the off-site renewable electricity we went through a stakeholder process to establish the criteria
what counts as off-site renewable print want to make sure that these nobles are high quality and are adding to
the room nobles on the grid as opposed to kind of counting the same or nobles that are already out there.

so, another aspect of the proposal from CDD has been buildings the option to choose an earlier baseline. this is
in response from trunk the back of the building owners that they wanted to have a way to take credit for action
before that default baseline of 2018 /2019. so, what we've done is we've allowed a baseline back as far as 2010.
but then we scaled the reductions so that buildings remain on that science-based trajectory of 50% by 2030
relative to that 2010 baseline and 100% by 2050. so, we can see that in these next couple of graphs and charts.so
on average BEUDO buildings have been reducing their emissions largely again due to the grid by 2.53% a year.
so, when we look at that trajectory if you take a building back beyond the default baseline, we assume that their
missions would have been higher in 2010 and they were in 2018 and 2019. so, the amount of reductions that
they need to make by 2030 target are then proportionally higher. if buildings choose the 2010 baseline, they
have to make a 50% reduction by 2030 as opposed to the 40% reduction for buildings taking the default
baseline. but what this allows is for buildings that to take early action say that building reduces the greenhouse
gas emissions by 35% in 2050 before the default baseline at 35% reduction would have them in compliance
through the other 2029. so, they would get credit for having made the effort for the early action.
and it would prorate those reductions over time. so, this slide shows that if you take an early baseline in between
the default baseline in the 2010 year then the amount of reduction requirement is prorated accordingly. the other
flexibility mechanism shall be included is specific optional pathways for both laboratories and affordable
housing. I will show how you want to be very clear that while this is more flexibly to these building types it
achieves the exact same amount of a role greenhouse gas emissions reductions over time.
so, you see that these buildings have a longer time period to comply to give them more time to plan and
implement these budgets. but they have higher production professionals to rather than the 20% threshold in
2035. that was proposed these buildings would have to hit a 33% reduction threshold starting in 2027. and so,
when we look at that in comparison to the default pathway over time the affordable housing pathway is an
orange. the default pathway is in blue. and you see the kind of flop if you do the math on hypothetical building
the lifetime emissions from those two buildings over the policy period are exactly the same.
so again, it is not a less stringent pathway for those buildings. it's just flexibility mechanism to give them more
time to plan for and implement those projects. we've also proposed flexibility for campuses. this being true
campuses like the university for that city buildings it does not apply to portfolio owners of rented properties. but
the goal is to let those summers aggregate their missions across all of their buildings and so that they can then
make investments at that campus level.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

so, these requirements are fairly stringent. in order to add to that were nobles out there. and were hoping to help
building owners access these were nobles potentially through pathways such as our community aggregation
program. the alternative compliance credits again are an alternative compliance mechanism that buildings can
choose, and we propose a price for these credits of $234 a ton which is consistent with the Boston ordinance.
and that price is based on the average cost of producing emissions from buildings such as these. so, it takes the
average cost over time and deposit forward to understand without marginal cost would be connect the goal is to
incentivize buildings to take action but then give a reasonable alternative payment mechanism which would
then be reinvested in city programs and projects to reduce carbon throughout the community.

there are handful of exemptions in the proposal. the primary exemption being buildings that have already
limited their missions were achieved net zero and we expect most new buildings will achieve that standard in
the near future so for new buildings built in the in between years. there's a grace period for those buildings to be
able to get up to speed and plan their admission trajectory emissions reduction with net 0 by 2050.
again, looking at the bigger picture net zero action plan other avenues that require buildings to achieve net zero.
as many of you probably know the state is just released the first draft of their net zero threshold proposal so will
follow in participating in development of that proposal very closely. over the next year so that we have a clear
mechanism to require buildings to achieve net zero emissions and therefore have achieved the goals of the
building energy use disclosure ordinance. performance requirements. we also propose exemptions for buildings
that are not operating that are vacant. being demolished. every buildings under financial distress.

in the event of noncompliance, we got the existing penalty structure for BEUDO. the other elements of
compliance with performance requirements. so separate penalties can be assessed for not reporting the current
penalty structure. for reporting false data since we can't delete the performance requirement finds based on data.
we require buildings and proposed buildings are required to have a third-party audit of their baseline. a
compliance date of so we can check the veracity of that data and of course not complying with the actual
performance reductions. so, the form of the penalty is a violation of up to $300 per violation per day. and
finally, we propose that once we get the first year of reporting in the first complaint that the policy be reviewed
and make it is the time to check in on the effectiveness of the policy. to consider adjustments that are needed
and to move forward with those adjustments.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair thanks to Seth for that excellent presentation. I’m excited
as well to be discussing these amendments print, I had a quick question about the exemptions for buildings. if
we can say a little bit more about that. if the building is truly net zero, would we want them to nonetheless
report their energy emissions so we can verify that if they are net zero and they would know with any money.
then it would be de facto exempt anyway.
>> Seth Federspiel: I think that's a fair question. the assumption is that zero buildings will continue to comply
with the reporting elements of BEUDO. but they would not be expected to follow the mission reduction
trajectory if they already done so. I think may be a bit of a technicality. and so is something we're happy to
discuss and figure out the most efficient way to address.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: awesome thank you.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you Mr. chair. that they might have been the second presentation as you indicated
it was a good thing because I actually think I got more out of it this time. and I think I thank you for that. it was
an excellent presentation. my question is on the penalties he wouldn't just be assuming somebody doesn't listen
at all which hopefully will happen. it's more than the three zones that you called for the three areas which were
that up to 350,000 rated it would be plus the tonnage penalty would it not?
>> Seth Federspiel: again, I would defer to the law department for guidance on this. I don't know if Megan is
here.
>> Megan Bayer, associate city solicitor: through you Mr. chair. so, we are limited in the way that we can issue
a penalty. under the noncommittal disposition statute and/or ordinance so it's $300 a day for a violation. and that
is the maximum that we can depose.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: trying to get clarification how do you charge per ton assuming they didn't reduce
anything? that's why they didn't report. we think that would be an add-on may be that cold a penalty. I don't
know what to call the $234 per ton. cost but it seems to me that it would be both. I mean it's a serious it's more
serious and more of an encouragement to follow up. $350,000 quite frankly for some people would not be a big
issue. if the tonnage is also paid for. the exhaust. that's a serious combination . I don't think … I assume both
would be in effect, what about the exhaust? the greenhouse gases in the air? I’m not trying to be tricky.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: this is an opportunity to ask clarifying questions about the presentation we just
celebrated I seem Councillor Zondervan cochair of the ordinance committee and Councillor Carlone if others
have questions, please use the raise your hand feature.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I think councilor there were two numbers that were put up there as penalties there
was the $234 then there was the $300 a day. so, I think what Councillor Carlone is asking does that mean they
could be fined $524 per day.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I’m sorry I thought I said that but maybe not.
>> Seth Federspiel: through you my chair I just want to add the $234 is not a penalty. it is not a fine. the $234 is
an alternate compliance option. the buildings may choose to satisfy all or part of their greenhouse gas emission
reduction requirement. so, they can make that payment to the fund to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance.

but it's not a penalty. and if they … therefore if they don't report or don't do anything at all the $234 would not
be part of that equation.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: I will let it ride thank you very much.

>> Seth Federspiel: just to clarify Mr. chair you are speaking to the $234? we arrived at that number by building
off the analysis that Boston had done on the actual cost of reducing emissions in buildings such as those
covered by BEUDO. so, the analysis showed that the average cost of all of the measures that might be taken
between now and 2050 to get the net zero would be that $234. so, the idea is by setting that as the alternative
compliance credit level buildings would be incentivized to take the many measures that cost significantly less
than that and some that have a negative cost or savings buildings in overtime as is written in the proposal that
alternative amount could also be adjusted to reflect the changes in technology and changes in cost. so, the idea
is to incentivize the buildings to take as much action directly as they can.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you councillor toner.
>> Paul F. Toner: like you Mr. chair set around my question is do you based on what you presented and being
in the process it seems like you did a pretty thorough job of engaging all the stakeholders, the universities,
business groups and others that might be impacted by that . it sounds like you also reached some degree of
consensus about the achievability by 2050 of meeting these goals, is that correct?
>> Seth Federspiel: so, we had 40 meetings with the stakeholders over the four years that we've been working
on this. I will let them speak for themselves. but I think the sense is we did reach a good level of agreement on
both the form and astringency in the timeline of the policy. again, noting that really the timeline that we pursued
is one that is in line with the science.
>> Paul F. Toner: my only follow-up you mentioned IPCC I’m not familiar with that organization. I know you
said that this plan meets IPCC standards the note we did at least one letter and public comments from someone
suggesting may be IPCC has a different take on things. can you clarify for me whether this meets IPCC
standards or not?
>> Seth Federspiel: sure, through you Mr. chair the IPCC is inter intergovernmental panel on climate change. it
is the intergovernmental panel of scientists to study climate change and assess what greenhouse gas emissions
reductions must be achieved to avoid the worst effects of climate change. and so, the science that we are basing
it on was based on the 2018 and 2020 report which cited a 50% reduction by 2010. I’m sorry a 50% reduction
relative to 2010 by 2030 and 100% reduction for net zero by 2050. it is that pace we need to achieve. so that
again is a trajectory that we designed the policy to achieve.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: quick follow-up. then I will go to councillor toner. I had a question on that was
well how did that figure, did you arrive at that figure is that enough of a deterrent for someone ultimately want
people to comply and not buy their way out of it. how did you get that number? is he going to be easier for
somebody to buy their way out of doing this?

>> Paul F. Toner: one less follow-up, has anything changed in the past year. Have they come out with different
metrics or anything or are they still in agreement with that last statement you made that?
>> Seth Federspiel: to my knowledge it's still the same.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: any other clarifying questions from the committee? not seeing any other hands.
okay. thank you thank you for the presentation don't go away. we will now go to Councillor Nolan.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I’m in city hall but not. all good?
this is a visual presentation laying out amendments that Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Carlone and I have
discussed over the last few months actually as the BEUDO conversation happened. so, you all the city council
as a matter of public record received a memo that was part of the public record for our Monday meeting with a
little bit more text around this.
this will not… this presentation doesn't talk about the actual language changes, but it does present a summary of
what it is we are proposing and why.

BEUDERO is critical to our success as a city to reach our climate goals. what BEUDERO does is mandate
emissions reductions from existing large building. Seth has ably talked about this and CDD has put forth a
proposal for how that would be put in place. it puts a price of emissions from buildings and eventually requires
emissions reductions to net zero. the picture on this page is the new MIT building on main street. the city
council has for many years worked on climate emissions reductions. and it was actually in 2011 a couple of
you were on the council. this council voted on zoning at the time… the reason this really critically important is
even in 2011 every single building owner Cambridge was on notice that net zero was something the council and
the city was incredibly interested in. at that time MIT was not ready to build these buildings net zero.
unfortunately, the amendments didn't pass. but with BEUDERO these buildings like every other existing
building have to become a net zero overtime. There is a really important context that we all have to be aware of
and I know that several councilors and some in the public are not as aware of the timeline here. Seth mentioned
it with net zero action plan that helped create BEUDO in the first place. that first action plan laid out a timeline
for BEUDO encoded in the actual language of BEUDO was initiated the patient that this is meant to spur
reductions in emissions. if it doesn't by the end of 2018 new requirements were going to be put in place. they
were supposed to be put in place and tested from 2018 – 2022. the first version of performance requirements
which would have mandated performance requirements to reduce emissions.
the first period never happened we are now starting the first period just in 2022. We are supposed to be at the
end of the first period which is about to be reviewed in 2023 and a second version of requirements started in
2024. it is critically important to understand why it is that for all of the work that is been done the BEUDO…
the net zero action plan timeline, we are three years behind. in anticipated also possible for adding requirements
which again means every single building owner has known since 2014 since BEUDO pass. that this was
coming. so, what we are proposing is to build on the fantastic work of CDD who has put forth a lot of effort into
the BEUDERO standards and do a couple things. one simplify it by taking out some fairly complex alternative
compliance timelines. taking out some different… remove some of this additional work that was done and in
our view over complicates it. there are a few key things. number one faster reductions to net zero by 2050. to
reduce emissions faster on the highest emitters mainly lab building. charge new nonresidential buildings for all
their emission that will be someone's discussed in line with the new green deal amendments the Councillor
Zondervan will be talking about.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

let me go back. this building just so people know this image shows the construction of a new Alexandria bio-lab
building which includes a geothermal field to reduce energy requirements and emission . This buildings being
built right now as we speak in Cambridge. far better than the existing buildings. as CDD noted in the original
BEUDO with methods for reductions and it did not succeed.

The image on this page is the new biomed realty building proposed for Third Street. this will be an all-electric
bio-lab buildings which means they can quickly get to net zero through purchasing renewable energy almost
from day one. it is critical to note given particularly… I appreciate councillor toner's question about the IPCC
target, we hear a lot about science -based targets. here is the deal. the IPCC target of 2050 is for the earth as a
whole. the earth as a whole.
if that is going to be reached it absolutely requires that environmental leaders have to be much faster than what
the IPCC ultimate end goal is. there is no way that the entire earth by following… will follow the emissions that
we are talking about which means all of us with yours as is environmental leaders absolutely have an obligation
to do everything we can to accelerate because otherwise there is no help for the planet. I am not exaggerating

that. not only that the world has changed a lot. remember BEUDO was passed in 2014. we discussed in 20122013, was finally passed by the council in 2014 we are six years beyond that, and the world is only more urgent.
we cannot meet our own goals without an accelerated timeline which is why we're saying it should not be 2050.

they already are being built fossil fuel free. Frankly they are the highest emitters and also the most profitable.
They are exactly the sweet spot that we should be moving to say all of them should be net zero as soon as
possible. establish more stringent baseline. so, what we are proposing is a kind of hybrid. what Boston did with
set a baseline for all buildings to match. What we are saying is wherever you are you start, and you lower from
there. what we're saying is yes that is absolutely true. if you're lower than average or if you're even average to
start where you are just reduced on a timescale. but if you're one of the highest emitters. why would he allow
you to start out really, really high, and only reduce the same percentage as somebody else. so, it will be kind of
a hybrid approach. just for that first period on the same timeline as everyone else and all new BEUDO
buildings, the baseline has to be zero emissions.
as Seth said that is true for all existing net zero buildings, all new the buildings will be built in the city next few
years have to be zero baseline for greenhouse gas emissions. that element will be presented a little more indepth with part of the green new deal amendment. so why do we say 2035? just remind the council. before I
was on it. maybe before Councillor Zondervan, certainly not before Councillor Carlone. April 24, 2017, policy
order passed that the council supports the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy in Cambridge
including in building energy and transportation by 2035. That goal was reaffirmed December 13 of 2021. so,
I’m reminding all of us we cannot possibly achieve that goal if BEUDO buildings are still burning fossil fuels
after 2035. We likely can’t even achieve it with a long-term goal of 2040 or 2050 if we don't take accelerated
action now and at this point, we still causing emissions indirectly. how many of us have gotten an amazon or
some kind of delivery in the last few weeks?
those are all shipping of goods into Cambridge which the emissions are not captured in this. so, this is a
reminder that a net zero BEUDERO building does not really mean zero omissions because you can have
residual missions and you can also basically buy your way out. as Seth noted many of these places have just met
there reduction targets by the greening of the grid. They buy 100% renewable energy and electricity. They have
not stopped burning fossil fuels. they just used 100% renewable energy as a way to meet… lower their
emissions. that is still allowed and under the current BEUDERO proposal building can still pay to pollute while
meeting the definition of net zero. That may be changed later. The idea is if you really say, I cannot possibly
stop burning fossil fuels my basement then you pay that alternative compliance payment. so, another reason
we're passionate about this is that we know it's been really, really, really hard. the city has been working on
climate actions for more than 20 years. more than 20 years. The climate action plan was in 2002 literally 20
years ago. and there's a whole slew of work done even before that plan. we been trying to reduce emissions
since 2003 if not before and it's been unsuccessful. these are some quotes from various. I think mostly the first
couple in the CPAC annual report for greenhouse gas emission continue to increase in 2003 it should be noted
that emissions will remain in 1990. the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2010 had not been met
even by 20% rate reduction and overall, the citywide building emissions from 2012 – 2019 grew 11.3% this is
the most recent data we have this is based on the outside consultant report looking at the net zero action plan
and this is for the building sector. they found overall it grew from 2012 – 2019, 11%. it was supposed to be
going down 20 or 30% and it hasn't. The five-year review which was published in 2021… I believe that is
actually 2020, I think is 2021 found that the first five years of that plan which was an action plan was to lead to
reduction in fact essentially led to no progress. they had calculated a 1% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions
which of course 1% is almost nothing.

and again, it should not be a surprise to any building owner. since BEUDO was passed many years ago. so, the
proposed amendments to… the amendments to the amendments which you have seen in writing. Net zero by
2035, not 2050. that is completely in line with the science-based targets of the IPCC 's as we know and as all of
the people who discussed this have said there needs to be some action by many players up front it is why…
90% of new homes in the Netherlands built in last year 90% in the last year were fossil fuel free. Ithaca will be
fossil fuel free by 2030. we cannot wait until 2050 and cannot be satisfied with just being with the crowd would
be… I think a huge lost opportunity for a climate leader like Cambridge. Let’s simplify the reductions to a
percent a year, not every five years. strike some of the exemptions. allow an alternative schedule for 100%
affordable housing, yes, but not for laboratories, laboratories should not be exempt.

That was not anything that we expected or what we hope for, is far behind what we expected or desired
outcomes. That review called for a drastically different approach which is what led us here today to
BEUDERO. so, let's look at what would happen. this is a visual to say we are all talking about the same thing.
getting to net zero. we are proposing let's do a faster decline. that is, it. this shows you an overall the
BEUDERO buildings started 100%, the proposal we are saying is you are already going to make this rapid
steep decline and get to net zero by 2035 and the other way the amendments are proposing to amend it still has
the decline without actually changing that methodology, we are saying it has to be faster. both schedules require
20% reduction starting at 2025 and not a lot before them other than for high emitters. as we mentioned, as we
know, rapid near-term emissions are critical. just like anything else if you are paying off your interest is in your
pay it the better. for here the sooner we reduce emissions the better because if you don't reduce them this year
then they go on for 10 years. if you reduce them in 10 years there was a lot less than reducing them now.
Cambridge is a leader on climate change action or wants to be. Right now, we really should step it up and show
others that can be done. the other reminder for us is what actual building will do. if I own a building just like my
house, I have been looking ay ground source heat exchange. while we see this nice step function, for individual
buildings it will be I am either going to buy all me renewable energy and reduce immediately or I am going to
electrify immediately. it would be more like I am going to drop pretty soon and then using renewable energy
purchases. it won’t be all clean and a step function for everybody or 8% per year more like 50% one year, 40%
the next year and then they will be done.
again, we can talk more about what this means. Neither of these steps completely eliminates emissions. it's
really only the actual energy consumption that we are talking about right here in this chart. it's really important
to create economic pressure in favor of eliminating wasteful energy consumption that we don't need. so, here's
an example. let's use an example of how our proposal varies from the amendments on the table. so, you know
what this data shows you have a nice redline and a pink line. redline is for according to the 2019 BEUDO data
from every year you can look it up on the web you have about 800 buildings per year out of 1000 who report
their use. Biogen according to this data that was accessed on the Cambridge open data portal was at a really
high level of greenhouse gas emissions intensity which is measured in kilograms of carbon per square foot.
what we're saying is the really high emitters instead of being able to start high and just reduce like everybody
else, which is what the redline is, they have to immediately reduce.
again, they can buy alternative compliance payments, but they have to reduce it down to the industry average by
2025. from there just like everyone else. so, these are two specific properties in Cambridge from the BEUDO
database one is Biogen, which is super high, above average, then the other is 2 oxford street which is a Harvard
lab, and it basically is at the average of labs, and for them the CDD proposal would be yes over time they don't
reduce that much because they are pretty good in terms of greenhouse gas emission intensity. our proposal has
them reduce a little faster. it's worth noting that both of these buildings are on the list of the top 25 largest
buildings emitters in Cambridge.
of the thousands that we found in the BEUDO list the top 25, both of these are on it which means even to oxford
street which is far far less than biogenic is the one of the top 25 largest buildings of greenhouse gas emitters by
intensity which means settings industry-standard would not in effect in the vast majority of buildings. only
require 15 or 20 buildings to dramatically move that standard by 2025 because they are not already meeting it.
The industry standard the use of 25 is calculated from Boston’s BEUDO proposal. Their number for science and
technology was 19.2 kg per square foot. and for manufacturing with 23.9. so, we chose 24 as an industry
standard as the highest of both of those. all the data comes from the Cambridge open data portal and it's from
the year 2019 as a baseline. so, the summary here is that an underperforming building, meaning way more than
average, it is going to reduce sooner because it… if you visualize that lie between the pink and redline all of that
is additional emissions that will be paid for under the proposal.

final slide. so, let's also remember even if BEUDERO buildings which is 1000 buildings that Seth noted is only
7% but is 60%-70% of emissions. even if they all collectively cut their emissions in half. that only gets us to
half our goal. the city needs other major cuts in order to get to even half because BEUDO buildings are little bit
over half the energy… the total greenhouse gas emissions in the city. so, if they go down, we only solve … the
pie chart is going to get net zero citywide… 50% reduction for BEUDO is only 28% of the whole city. so even
if we achieve that goal on the nose it doesn't mean we achieve it for Cambridge overall. Which means we have

City of Cambridge

Ordinance Committee

February 9, 2022

to overshoot for the BEUDO sector to leave room for the challenges everybody else going to face the rest of the
city is not going to reduce their emissions by 50%.
so that is what we hope our colleagues will agree. it's an urgent area we know that people have worked with a
range of stakeholders. what I can say is this is feasible. You saw examples of buildings in Cambridge right now
being built this way. and that reduction can happen and eventually… There is very the report out that shows
when you do this you actually save money that the state… the proposal for net zero energy stretch code as I’ve
mentioned and frankly the response from the community and folks that follow this is not going to get us where
we need to go that is not going to save us. we cannot rely on that because it's going to allow continued use of
fossil fuels which we should not sustain in Cambridge.
that is, its Councillor McGovern. I will stop sharing.

>> Paul F. Toner: thank you Mr. chair. Councillor Nolan have you done any outreach to the various
stakeholders who were involved in 40 meetings over the past four years to discuss these potential amendments
because I’m just concerned about making these changes and yanking the rug out from… what seems like
consensus documents at this point. have you had an opportunity to reach out to them?
>> Patricia M. Nolan: we haven’t talked to the entire climate protection action committee. the climate crisis
working group and several members of the net-zero action plan task force who were involved in that. they have
all sent letters to the council agreeing that we need to accelerate, and we need to do this. that is certainly
something that is next step as we go forward in this process. and I will say outreach to those actors includes a
number of people were on the net zero action plan that was discussed again at the climate crisis working group
and at the CPAC which is the central body of the city to give advice to the city as a whole on climate issues.
does that answer your question?
>> Paul F. Toner: one follow-up I don't know the members of the CPAC does that include people represented
from MIT, Harvard, the bio-labs. are they in agreement that this is something that they support?
>> Patricia M. Nolan: I can't speak for all of the members. we can hear from them later. my response to that is
there is going to be some pushback from those players. my response is of course because they are the highest
emitters. when you look at those highest emitters, it is the people you're talking about. so, it's like saying yes,
I’m not dismissing that whole process. what I am saying… we tried to say in the presentation this is a different
world from even five years ago. and every single building in Cambridge has been on noticed since long before
BUEDO came forward but that was promulgated and actually in the law in 2014 that this was coming.
>> Paul F. Toner: again Mr. chair, through you Mr. chair my only concern is as a city and as a council we invite
people to the table to have these discussions to come up with a consensus document and then we throw a
complete curveball and suggest reducing things by 15 years. I think even in your comments you said we are
several years behind, and we also now go to truncate it by 15 years. I understand the urgency. I get the
comments we are getting. I do hope that we go to engage the other stakeholders especially the one that going to
implement this to get their response.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you. council questions?

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: Mr. chair can give a direct response to … thank you Mr. chair through you
Mr. chair to councillor toner. I appreciate the question I think it is a fair question. but I will add that we are
stakeholders also. as residents of the city and inhabitants of this planet. the decision about how much pollution
we are supposed to accept is not purely up to the building owners. that being said personally I’ve been in
conversations with these developers and building operators in Cambridge for over a decade on this issue. so,
this is not new it is not being sprung out of nowhere. as Councillor Nolan mentioned back in 2011 there was a
vote in this council on MIT’s proposed buildings on main street being net zero so to the extent possible, we
can’t… unfortunately we can't afford lobbyists and consultants but to the extent possible we made our voices
heard as residents and stakeholders in the city and we have been very clear for over 10 years that we need these
buildings to be net zero now. particularly the new ones but also the existing ones and the BEUDO process goes

back before 2014. it was adopted by the council in 2014 but was worked on for several years before that. there
shouldn't be any surprises here that we are saying this timeline is too little, too late and thank you Mr. chair.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: Mr. chair through you these amendments were first put forth by Councillor
Nolan, Councillor Carlone and myself last year at the health and environment meeting. Again, we are having an
ordinance committee meeting now. we were planning to have another ordinance committee at least one more.
so, there's plenty more opportunity for the building owners to let us know how they feel and read the letter from
the chamber of commerce today.
>> Alanna M. Mallon, Vice Mayor: thank you Mr. chair. through you. following along what councillor toner
was saying. I think we are in a different time right now. we have received some really bad news even recently
that new England is in a dire situation and Massachusetts in particular. the land is shifting underneath our feet,
and we do need these to respond to make sure we are being responsive and shift that timeline. the one thing I’m
wondering is if there is some time… The ordinance committee is not a great place to have that conversation
with building owners.
we got a couple building or developers like Alexandria, Biomed, they are building buildings currently that are
going to be fossil free. we also have developers who have not been brought to the table around some of these
amendments and I am wondering if there is a way to do that outside of the ordinance committee process. that
would be helpful to bring people to the table to talk about why this is so important to talk about some of these
amendments and changes and timelines. I’m not saying change them, necessarily, but I am… it is important for
people to work together. we got an email from MIT that they were not contacted. They are one of the biggest
developers in the city and I would hope that we would go to them as a partner and as somebody who I know has
really aggressive climate goals.
what are those climate goals and how can we be partners and work together? so in between now and the
planning board meeting and subsequent ordinance meetings I would encourage us to have a conversation or the
motion makers to have that conversation with some of those bigger developers, the ones that are doing the fossil
free-work, Alexandria, Biomed and the folks that are not necessarily building right now to net zero but had we
have that conversation and bring everybody to the table because we do know that there was those 40
conversations. we know that there was some consensus and I understand… we all understand we are in an
emergency.
the land is shifting underneath our feet. how we work together and partner. it's not a question necessarily. I
guess it's more of a comment of let's try to figure out how to bring the players to the table and really talk about
what we are trying to do together and partner. so, I will yield back at the time sorry Mr. chair that was not a
question more of a comment.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Paul F. Toner: I don't want to engage in a big debate. I just feel that if they were going to shave 15 years off
a timeline that was agreed to by 40 meetings and four years with all stakeholders. I understand we are all
stakeholders, and I don’t want anyone to get the sense that I don’t want to solve the climate crisis as quick as
everybody else, but I also don't have to meet these requirements. I just want to make sure that we engage those
folks and have conversation about how we do things as quickly as possible and as fairly as possible and not just
surprise them with a 15-year change in the timeline. thank you.

>> Dennis J. Carlone: I do have a question for Seth on the 40 meetings he mentioned . Seth was that really
BEUDO or was that net zero meetings?
>> Seth Federspiel: that was BEUDO through you Mr. chair. beginning in 2018 we had a series of meetings that
were open to all BEUDO building owners. first to design… to go through a process to understand what the
framework for building performance standards in Cambridge could be. we also had a series of meetings about
the technical support and resources that these buildings would need to achieve the emissions reductions we are
talking about, and we already launched the Cambridge building energy retrofit program in the fall of 2019. to
provide easy access to the state incentives and technical support for buildings to meet the standards. there were
number working group meetings as well as follow-up meetings because this process did stretch out in part due

to the pandemic and other delays and so we had continual meetings in 2020 and 2021 so that all of the property
owners could be aware of the proposal leading up to its submission to council.

my own feeling is, as I tried to say a few weeks ago, if our goal is 2050 and we overshoot it's 2060. If our goal
is 2035 and we overshoot it's 2042 or something like that. there is no doubt in my mind the world is going to
overshoot, and we are the leaders. we are the smartest people and as far as developers go of course we have to
talk to them. of course, institutions. believe me they know. but we have to talk to them. but we represent more
than developers. we represent the residents. I’ve told you all that I have bad asthma. you can hear it. and some
of the longer-term councilors might remember that were a few years in the winter when I couldn't talk without
coughing every sentence which I’m sure excited everybody and that was because of the air quality. thank God I
have medication that helps. my point is this a serious stuff. I think the city has done great work. and we are
revving it up. and maybe it won’t be met but it will be a lot closer and a lot sooner if our goal is sooner. thank
you.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you councillor. anybody else before asking my question.
a couple of things. I will make a quick comment. I think we're sort of… I don't know if splitting hairs is rights
term or missing each other. I think the comment that people have known that this is coming is true. this has
been talked about for a long time but what they sort of thought was coming was 2050. 2035 and all these other
amendments that are now being proposed tonight was not something that people necessarily saw coming until
they were presented in December. I think both things are actually true. people knew something was coming and
there was this committee to work on it. and they thought what was coming was 2050 and now all of a sudden,
we have all of these new things are saying 2035. I am not saying which is better or worse. so, the feeling for
some of those folks saying we have not never really discussed this enough? I think it's also understandable
because these are pretty significant changes, that may be necessary changes, but is not quite fair to say they
knew this is coming. they knew the overall goal was coming, they did not know these amendments were
coming.
that aside Councillor Nolan I don't know if you can answer this or maybe Seth. in the examples you gave… We
are not just talking about new buildings. We are also talk about retrofitting buildings so an example that you
gave were all new buildings. I’m not an expert…You used Alexandria, Biomed. these are buildings are being
built now again I am not the expert; it would seem to me that that might be an easier thing… to build something
from scratch and do something a certain way than retrofitting. I guess my question is… I would love 2035. I
sort of agree with… I’d rather set ambitious goals. if you don't make them as Councillor Carlone just said you
have a little more wiggle room. I don't want to set goals that make us just feel good because they're like we are
just doing something we said 2035 we are better than everybody else. I want to make sure that they can be done.
That the science is there. that they are achievable. what's the difference between retrofitting a building versus
building a new building and what happens if all these buildings go electric? We have talked a lot about our
power grid being maxed out and then what does that mean that that mean. do we need more substations and
then where are those going to go? This all layers together. I guess my question to Councillor Nolan what do you
understand as the difference between new buildings versus retrofitting buildings and are these goals applicable
to both of those kinds of things? is it easier to build a new building and meet these goals versus retrofit and meet
his goals.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you. I work with developers almost my whole career. it certainly in urban design
for 45 years and I found that there were few enlightened once we get it, like Joe Maguire at Alexandria but there
are others who were so, and I get why, short-term thinking. they liked putting expenses… like we all do… if
you own a home or a condominium out as much as possible. I believe Councillor Nolan mentioned this but
when MIT got its up-zoning for main street the original condition was net zero buildings. that was voted on by
the council. and approved and then MIT spoke to one or two of the councilors and the votes were changed. so,
this isn't new. this has been around.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I totally agree. we should get all the players to the table. I agree with that. it's something
that we need to be doing. I will also note that if building owners are at the table that is like the tobacco
companies being the ones to say how do you reduce smoking. there are literally the people emitting these
emissions.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I don't want to put MIT in the same category as tobacco companies.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: some of the question was… in other discussions about this I’ve heard people say
that the science isn’t quite there yet. it's not quite ready. so, part of the goals of 2050 were to sort of hoping that
things would kind of catch up and I guess is that…
>> Patricia M. Nolan: I talked two developers in the last couple weeks and they said if you asked us to do this
five years ago, I would've said you are crazy. right now, it really has changed. can it happen? I would argue
especially given MIT and Harvard’s commitment, they have the people, the best people placed on earth to do
this. they can do it and remember if you can't get there within a few years you can have alternative compliance
payments which then go into a fund to help solve this.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you I know other folks… to answer my question. I would say this before I
turn it over, I’m going to go to. Iram because… before I go there… this does bring up and I mentioned this
Monday night, about is the ordinance committee and this is following up on what the vice mayor said, the
ordinance committee is a more clunky committee. we get the language. we get an amendment. we discussed the
amendment. it just us at the table. we decide what we like the amendment, or we don't, we vote on it. whereas
it's not like a human services committee where you invite DHSP, and you invite that nonprofit afterschool
people, and you invite all these other people to the table, and we sit around and say how we come to solve the
problem. I guess that sort of a question in terms of yes MIT will… I don't know if they're on the phone now.
they will say their three minutes or two minutes and that is it. that is different than being at the table saying
okay how do we all get to the goal of 2035 and here's what our problems are and hear what our concerns are
how can we get those mini substations around the city? that doesn't happen in the ordinance committee. so, it is
something for us to think about. If we just pass these amendments, then it's codified its law. that other
discussions happening after the fact. it's something to think about this isn’t the best place to have those more in
the weed’s kind of conversations.
>> Patricia M. Nolan: just a correction, the IPCC save the recent report was code red for humanity literally is
what it was called. it has changed.
>> Iram Farooq: thank you chair McGovern I really wanted to bump it to Seth because he and the team have
done a lot of work on existing buildings and bringing their energy efficiency so he can speak to your question,
and I just also wanted to mention that BEUDO applies to a pretty wide spectrum of buildings. I know we have
sort of been focusing a lot on the very large, very capitalized players but there are number of smaller buildings
that are subject to the BEUDO amendments that do BEUDO and therefore the amendments… They will have
different levels of capacity in order to comply. I will just turn it over to Seth.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Patricia M. Nolan: I think they can do it right I think they could totally do it. to directly answer your
question, I think you raise all those important things we've discussed which is the electrification, the
substations, the capacity of the grid. which is probably why what we really want to do is we want geothermal
microgrids across the entire city. we want grounds for heat exchange to be used to dramatically lower the load
on the existing electric structure because you are tapping into the earth's natural heat. There are several places
where that is already in place for large building, and they do not have to rely on… they can do it with the
existing electrical structure but that's exactly what… your specific question about retrofit versus new. It is easier
with newer but remember the existing BEUDERO amendments assume every existing building has to come
down to zero. it’s only a matter of by when.

>> Seth Federspiel: thank you I just want to remind you Mr. chair and rest of the councilors of the table that I
showed early in the presentation about the structure of the net zero action plan. so BEUDO amendments and
BEUDO as it currently stands is specifically designed to address existing buildings and all the existing
buildings. Obviously new buildings become existing buildings but there other parts of the net zero action plan
where we seek to move new buildings to achieving net zero emissions from the start. so BEUDO is specifically
focused on existing buildings and as others have said has a very different process for an existing building to
retrofit, to change its existing systems and take them out and replace them to achieve net zero emissions than it
is for new building to be designed to be net zero emissions from the start. I just want to make that distinction.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I do see Councillor Carlone, Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Simmons. I
saw Councillor Carlone and Councillor Zondervan hands pop up in relation to my question potentially. I am
going to ask you guys to hold on that because we are not going to get to this resolved tonight. I’m just worried
about the time. we got 30 people. That is potentially an hour and then we still have to hear Councillor
Zondervan's presentation and go to clarifying questions about that. we’re going to be well past at 7:30 pm if we
do those public comments and do all that right now. I don't think we need to talk. you can answer those if you
have something additional to add but don't feel… I don't waste time answering my questions. if that's okay?

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair I will be brief. my presentation is not very long.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: can you speak up it's very hard to hear you.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: I am coming to you right now from my living room in an all-electric, zero
building. it took me 15 years to retrofit but we are using 60% less energy overall to run our house. and we are
using less electricity overall to run our house from the grid because we have solar panels. so, the answer to your
question is complex. but the brief answer is it absolutely can be done. we absolutely have to do it and it does not
require bringing tons of electricity into the city. It can't require that. that's not a good solution. we have to do it
locally by using our local energy sources, geothermal, we have to use solar and then of course we bring in some
renewable energy from wind. and the BEUDERO structure is quite good. if you look at the amendments that
we are proposing it's like 5% of the text we are trying to amend. it includes 30 specific ways that these buildings
can offset their energy use by building or buying more renewable energy off-site that doesn't have to be piped
into Cambridge because the grid itself is going to become more renewable. it's a complicated answer but the
answer to your question is yes you can do this work and we have to do it.
>> E. Denise Simmons: thank you Mr. chair this has been a very good conversation. I did want to say two
things… or several things. quickly I wanted to get to public comments because I do want to hear people from
the community have to say. I want to thank my colleagues for the time and the talent they brought to this
process. Councillor Nolan exuberance is palpable. I do have concerns. i believe some these amendments are
fairly new. in Cambridge we as a city, we talk about being a leader. we have been a leader in transparency and
predictability. so, if you say to someone were going to do this and were going to do this in 2050 and then turn
around and just change it without having discourse, meaningful discourse, we are not doing what we say we do.
I think the vice mayor said that the ordinance committee is not the place to do it. I would respectfully ask that
some of these amendments… I’ve not heard from Councillor Zondervan… go back to committee to be properly
vetted. I don't know what the contraindications or the unintended consequences may be, and I’m just as
concerned about climate change as a person of color and know that some of the downsides of the climate
change impact my community more than any others. thank you for using the pictures of black people Ms.
Nolan. so, for me if we’re going to be about transparency, predictability that we need to be transparent and
predictable. and to do that we really need to take this back to the table and invite people to have a conversation.
I don't think it is sufficient enough to say well I talk to these people, and they knew it was coming. so, I want to
say with all sincerity I certainly respect the work that son I look forward to my colleague’s presentation that's
about tempering I would hope that we get rather soon to public comment I think you said chairperson there are
30 people and 7:00. I recommend we continue this conversation because it really is going to take more time. my
stronger recommendation would be to take it back to the environmental committee and really tease this out a lot
more. I yield the floor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Dennis J. Carlone: just quickly, absolutely existing buildings are different, leases get finished at certain
times. I’m sure Seth and Iram are thinking about this. there would be a plan for existing buildings. so, one or
two floors would be vacant in two years. that's when work gets done and it can all be done until most of the
building is done. but nevertheless, it would speed it up quite a bit. I’m done. I won’t say anymore.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: Councillor Zondervan let me ask you this how long do you think your
presentation is.

of our clarifying questions since we're going to come back, we can certainly revisit Councillor Zondervan's
presentation. and then get the public comment. the difference between if we get the public comments and we
recess that would be no public comment at the next meeting. if we adjourn would mean we would have public
comment at the next meeting. some we would have to decide that when we get there.

what I’m about to present here is a smaller set of amendments that are part of the green new deal and I’ve
worked on with Councillor Nolan and Councillor Carlone some of these ideas were presented last year as part
of the green new deal zoning petition and based on feedback from the planning board we pulled it out of zoning
and this part is being put into BEUDERO which wasn't available to us at that time. so, we are proposing three
amendments. one is to allow the alternative compliance payments called credits in the language to be used for
green jobs training programs. number two is to require all large new commercial buildings to pay for all
emissions and number three to include embodied emissions.
this is just showing some of the investments happening where across the street from Newtown court you can see
on this map all of these technology buildings that are creating tremendous economic opportunity but not for the
people living across the street. and we are dealing with a double injustice hear as councillor Simmons
mentioned, climate change disproportionately impacts people of color and low-income communities, and they
are excluded from the economic opportunities and their being displaced by the rising cost of housing that is
created by all of this high-end economic development. there is a lot of injustice happening and when we are
counteracting climate change, we have to keep that in mind and try to design policy that counteract both
economic injustices and climate injustice.
that's what we are trying to accomplish with the green new deal. as you know on Monday, we introduced a
proposal for a green jobs ordinance. thanks again to councillor Simmons and the mayor and Councillor Carlone
for their support on that. and the idea in this amendment here is simply to allow the alternative compliance
payments that are being made by the developers if their building isn't net zero to go towards those green jobs
training programs. this shows the actual text, and you can see it literally is just a few words at the end that say it
can be used for green jobs training program. that is amendment number one. then amendment number two is to
require all new commercial buildings to pay for all of their emissions. one question might be why? so this is
from a report of the department of energy resources, which is a state department, it shows, in the black line, the
projected emissions from buildings, this is throughout the state, through 2050 if we don't require them to stop
fossil fuels. the green triangle which I added is showing approximately the amount of emissions that they can be
avoided if we adopt a net zero standard next year 2023 for the new building. so, you can see how much
potential emissions we can avoid if we put in place requirements, they start consuming fossil fuels or stop
consuming fossil fuels. this is totally feasible, in fact yesterday morning department of energy resources
introduced net zero energy stretch code that we can potentially enact by next year. this is another quick example
of the impact of new buildings. new buildings projected up to 2050 by square footage are green at the top and
existing buildings are blue at the bottom. clearly the existing buildings will still dominate. by 2050 a significant
amount of construction that's going to happen between now and then. and all that green area could be zero
missions if we adopt the right policies now.

>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair .can everybody see my screen? I do want to preface by
saying the original net zero task force which I was a part of with Councillor Carlone, we did have conversations
with the business community at that time as well. I’m always happy and open to doing that again and more. but
I do have to say that the fact that 40 meetings were had without us, and we are also stakeholders doesn't mean
that somehow, we have to abide by this agreement because we were excluded from that conversation. it's never
too late so let's communicate and certainly reach out to some of these building owners and have this
conversation. I’m not in favor of sending this back to committee. we already had this last week. thank you,
Councillor Nolan, for presenting those amendments.

why the commercial buildings, and Seth really cover this well already, commercial buildings simply count for
the vast majority of our emissions and if we don't put in place stringent requirements for new buildings, we’re
going to see exactly the same result again as we did with MIT on main street. Seth also mentioned this earlier
6% of the buildings in the city are responsible for two thirds of the emissions. it's pretty straightforward. we
know where the problem is and if we address those buildings, we can knock down our emissions. then for the

so, this is from another report showing that the building materials and construction are 11% of our global
emissions. that's a pretty significant number. that is currently completely unaccounted for. and most of that is in
the concrete, steel, and materials. it's relatively straightforward for us to calculate at least roughly what the
emissions contribution for a new building. the whole idea behind charging for those emissions is to create
economic pressures on those developers to minimize those emissions. this set of slides specified again the exact
language that creates the emissions requirements, and it basically says for new commercial buildings they
would have to pay for the embodies emissions over a ten-year period to gain alternative compliance credits. it
goes into more detail about what is to be included in the calculation as well is what we left out of the embodied
emissions calculation. this quickly just wrap up is a summary of the effect of the amendment. The BEUDERO
amendments as currently proposed would charge a new building, for the area that represents the excess
emissions, and according to BEUDERO they have to get those operating emissions to 0 by 2050. but if they
don't manage to do that which is simulated here in red than they can pay $234 per ton for those excess
emissions. what is important to note is that they would not pay for embodied emissions, and they would not pay
for the operational emissions that are allowed under the reduction schedule proposed by BEUDERO. what we
are proposing in these amendments is that the new commercial buildings would pay for all of their emissions
under these amendments and so as has been said earlier these emissions are all avoidable to a large extent it is
reasonable to say if you can’t avoid them then you have to pay for them, we would use those funds to do
emission reductions elsewhere and to create economic opportunity for low-income individuals. that is the
conclusion of my presentation.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: great thank you. councillor Simmons I assume that hand was from before.
>> E. Denise Simmons: yes, it was thanked you.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: any quick questions on that issue.
>> E. Denise Simmons: it wasn't. the question was I don't… I did not want to be thought of that I was trying to
cut off public participation. in terms of… you were right when you said if we recess this meeting, we won’t be
able to have public comment because we would've already had it. but if there is no appetite to bring this into a
forum where there can be more engagement because public comment doesn't give us the kind of engagement
that we needed to hear from people 's perspectives. then I would not recommend that we recess. just stay in
ordinance committee.

new buildings would avoid the problem in the first place to be net zero. so, the amendment for this is simply to
add a sentence which says all nonresidential commercial properties receive a special permit for 2022 and
beyond based on net zero. basically, they're not reducing from zero there expected to be at zero and if they have
any emission above zero, they will pay into the alternative compliance payment for those emissions which then
the city can use to install solar panels to help make affordable housing more energy efficient and to fund green
jobs training programs. then the last piece is the embodied emissions. this is just quickly showing what we mean
by that. so embodied emission are the emissions from reducing manufacturing, mining and materials that go
into the buildings. all the emissions that result from that as well as transporting those materials to the building
site in some cases these materials come from far away. and then of course the emissions produced by the actual
construction and heavy equipment to do that and here's why.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I have a thought on how we may want to do… we can possibly do all this, but I
will save that, keep you all in suspense until the end. and let's get to public comment. please state your name
and address for the record. obviously, we know what you're here to talk about. Mr. clerk can you call with first.
>> Kristine Jelstrup: 120 pleasant street. good evening and thank you so much for this opportunity to speak to. I
enjoyed the presentation. I will keep this short as I can hear you all well aware that the coming crisis is upon us.
and getting worse with every passing year. 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in Cambridge come from
buildings emissions. Emissions from all Cambridge buildings have gone up over 11% from 2012 – 2019. it is
imperative that we reverse this disturbing trend and move towards greenhouse gas reductions quickly. it's hard
to imagine reductions in the future when the trend has been to increase emissions. in order to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions, we need to hold super emitter buildings to account for all of their emissions. it's crucial to
Cambridge to pass the strongest BEUDO amendments possible. BEUDO is by far our best opportunity to

reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Cambridge. lastly Cambridge should aim to reach net zero emissions by
2035 not 2050 we need to act boldly, and we need to act now. thank you.

>> Margery Davies: I’m speaking as a member of the net zero action plan fund review task force. I appreciated
the opportunity to participate in the task force and have learned a lot from it. I’m also a member of the
Cambridge chapter of mother's out front. I have spoken to you a number of times about BEUDO. one thing I
want to make clear is in terms of BEUDO amendments as proposed by the community development
department, the net zero action plan task force was given the opportunity to comment on those proposed
BEUDO amendments once they've been submitted. the task force wasn't involved in crafting those BEUDO
amendments. I’ll be as brief as I can with several points. number one Cambridge needs to move more quickly.
it's been my main concern since the beginning of the task force work in Cambridge really needs to speed up in
my opinion. second point is that less than two months ago on December 13 the city council reaffirmed its
commitment originally made in 2017 for the goal of using 100% clean and renewable energy by 2035 not 2050.
point number three the situation is urgent. greenhouse gas emissions by buildings in Cambridge have gone up
over 11% not down in recent years. this is going in the wrong direction. point number four accountability. I’m
concerned that Cambridge does not hold itself accountable for the goals it has set. deadlines are often missed, or
we fail to enforce requirements. one troubling example is the rate of compliance with reporting requirements for
buildings covered by BEUDO. remember buildings have been required to report their emissions for the past six
years. in 2015 95% of BEUDO buildings reported their energy use. the percentage of buildings reporting has
gone steadily down every year since. by 2020 only 73% of BEUDO buildings reported. point number five. the
BEUDO amendments proposed by the community development department need to be strengthened. the
BEUDO amendments proposed by Councillor Nolan and Councillor Zondervan do just that and I hope that you
will support them. in conclusion this is not a competition. we are all in this together. city councilors, city staff
and Cambridge residents creating the strongest BEUDO amendments that we can… should be a group effort.
when we succeed, we will all be able to be proud of our roles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in
Cambridge. thank you very much.
>> Greg Carey Medlock: I live in 253 river street. today I’d like to express my support for the BEUDO
amendments as proposed by councilors Nolan and Zondervan. I moved to Cambridge recently with my wife and
son. One of the most appealing features of Cambridge is that it is a leader in progressive action, including
climate change mitigation. we feel strongly that it is our duty to leave the world a bit better for the next
generation. thank you, councilors, for your service and doing your part for the next generation. Cambridge is a
walkable, livable city with excellent public transit which strongly enables our ability to reduce emissions.
however, greenhouse gas emissions from buildings are increasing despite infrastructure for an emissions
monitoring put in place by BEUDO. building emissions have gone up by 11% and commercial institutional
buildings specifically we have seen at 29% increase in carbon emissions. as a scientist myself that has worked
in laboratory settings, I can tell you that this is not necessary. we need a coordinated and proactive response to
reduce building emissions to improve local air quality and mitigate our influence on the climate crisis. the
proposed BEUDO amendments do just that. climate change is an urgent and unparalleled problem. It impacts
our health, job security and homes especially from those vulnerable members of our community. we must move
quickly. I’m in support of reaching net zero by 2035 as committed to previously by the council. I urge the
ordinance committee and council to approve the amendments and to prioritize climate change action. thank you.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you.

>> David Rabkin: chair of the coming protection action committee. Tonight, I represent myself. I’m going to
respond to what I heard tonight and change my remarks a little bit. first to something Councillor McGovern put
on the table. mark we are going all electrics or pretty close. it's going to take a lot of work. it just a matter of
how fast it's going to be. so, we really have to focus on that. secondly BEUDO is about existing buildings. but
we also need to do something about new buildings. right now, when it comes to new buildings, we are waiting
for the state to update the stretch energy code. unfortunately, that's almost a year away. best case. how much in
construction are we committed to between now and then. it is a big, missed opportunity. we need to take action
in the short run. we need an approach probably based on special permits. that seems like a likely good partial
solution. I recommend keeping it simple so it can be designed and implemented quickly.

>> Robert Michael Pittsley: hello I’m calling from 56 Norfolk Street. the many effects of climate change have
begun to take place and finally become blatantly unignorable. We are now living a scientifically predicted time
period faced with emerging diseases, food insecurity and sea level rise. one with so many undesirable realities
faced by environmental justice communities. we need to do everything we can to transition to a system more
conducive to public and environmental health. we must protect the viability of this new decision along with our
health by protecting our air quality. urban vegetation has several important functions beyond aesthetics. our
trees and shrubs have multiple impacts on air quality like for instance schools that are surrounded by green
space have lower levels of pollution in their classroom. in the past three years the focus around respiratory
health that we do our best to protect our air. the indirect effect of natural gas leakage on urban vegetation is
obvious since the soil gas phase composition near a leak is unfavorable for plant growth. within the gas zone the
oxygen concentration is very low to zero while carbon dioxide is high. consequently, root growth is stopped,
and respiration is inhibited so uptake of water and nutrients are reduced and eventually the plants die. after the
effects of gas leakage may persist for a considerable period of time. toxic components can be left in the soil as
reduced and nonorganic substances. effective restrictions and prevention of leakage of natural gas as well as
ensuing injury to street trees can only be realized if there's good cooperation between the city council, parks
department and municipal gas companies. I’m here tonight asking the Cambridge move faster, reach higher and
set the example. we can and must reach net zero emissions by 2035 not 2050. vast amounts of scientific
research clearly explain and can confirm the danger and failure of our recurring energy systems as well as the
viability of a more sustainable alternatives that are modeled in cities around the world. city council please adopt
the higher standards please provide jobs for people to build a healthier future held the buildings that we need.
and please ban gas hookups for buildings and reflect the 2035 that's your goal upon old BEUDO targets and
senders.

third my major point. please remember CPAC’s letters of December about BEUDERO . they're very supportive
of what came out of those 40 conversations. as was talked about earlier. and yet we wrote in a letter that
BEUDERO as proposed still falls short of the city's needs. so, we recommended that the city accelerate the
timelines in BEUDERO. considers including smaller buildings within the framework. explore additional
measures to reduce emissions from the highest emitting buildings more quickly than planned. create a schedule
to phase out the ACP that will require the elimination of on-site fossil fuel burning systems. evaluate the ACP
more frequently than planned to start at the end of the first compliance period. adopts the commonwealth new
stretch code as quickly as we possibly can. and finally invest in programs that provide the access to the
technical and financial resources that property owners are going to need in order to be able to actually make
improvements to the buildings that we need to meet our emissions goals. given official recommendations
coming from a player that is very supportive and should have bought in completely. I don't think it's appropriate
to label BEUDERO thus far as a result of a consensus process. as challenging it was to get where we are we
still have a way to go. thank you.

>> Sarah gallop: thank you can you hear me. good evening, everyone. MIT has been working closely with city
staff and Cambridge stakeholders since before BEUDO's inception in 2014. we been engaged in all phases of
the original ordinance’s development, implementation, and evaluation. and now the proposed amendments

unfortunately, we’re not able to support BEUDO tonight because of the new amendments that were introduced
two days ago. these late edits have not been discussed with stakeholders. and are not endorsed by city staff. this
last-minute flurry of activity runs counter to the nature of the entire BEUDO effort . while we've only briefly
scanned proposed edits, we that laboratories have been deleted from a section that has been extensively
researched. has anybody asked the BEUDO laboratory working group for its input? we noticed the time frames
have been drastically condensed leaving open questions regarding feasibility and available technology. has
anybody reached out to Eversource to get its view? MIT is committed to a comprehensive action plan of
achieving net zero emissions by 2026 and eliminating all direct emissions by 2050. it's no coincidence our
climate goals are aligned with the city's net zero action plan and the BEUDO amendments.
it's because we work together day in and day out on these matters. we share data, best practices, expertise, and
philosophies. we argue, offer counterproposals, rewrite, and regroup. and we make significant advancements as
a result of our commitment to the planet and as to the most reliable way of bringing about progress.
collaboration. we urge you to advance the November 2020 BEUDO amendments with continuing dialogue in
the areas we noted and reject the amendments that were introduced on Monday. thank you.
>> Thomas Lucey: sorry about that. good evening. I’m tom lucy speaking on behalf of Harvard university.
Harvard is committed to working with the city regarding reducing emissions to climate change and
sustainability for decades. we've advanced to our own second-generation climate goals and on our campus
through leading-edge goals. we were pleased to have participated and contributed for many years to the city
staff’s run stakeholder process that resulted in the BEUDO recommendations released in November. now given
the time limit in public comment we are going to address those recommendations, but we will react to the new
amendments were unveiled Monday night. Those new amendments demand the same full and thorough vetting
of public dialogue as the BEUDO process. We implore the council to take the time to reengage all stakeholders
to ensure it remains a civil and respectful dialogue. Everyone on the call shares the same goals of addressing
emissions and saving the planet. no one has a monopoly on those sentiments nor the knowledge of the best
approach to achieve them. as for the newly crafted amendments we have some initial comments and questions.
given the state of current technologies these proposed regulations will push building owners to explore
electrification at the same time. We have not seen a plan showing that the regional or local grid is capable of
handling these changes so rapidly. so, we asked is the city working with the state and Eversource to understand
the impact of this regulation and what the impact would be on the regional electric grid and specifically
Cambridge. is Cambridge planning to do a feasibility study to understand the scope of changes left to meet the
2030 proposed deadlines and to understand the risks and costs involved? what is the anticipated increase
electrical demand? and how will this electrical supply be generated? and if the city actively engage with
Eversource to provide this increased demand to the city? this removes our ability to utilize our subject matter
expertise as well as our rigorous approach to research and science to achieve net zero emissions. we want to do
this in partnership with the city and to identify the best path to achieve our shared goal of science-based net zero
solutions. I hope we get the opportunity to do so and that these amendments are not fast tracked but would
benefit from true scientific analysis and appropriate public dialogue.

related to performance requirements. we applaud the city's commitment to an open and transparent process.
with plentiful opportunities to engage, review, comment and co-develop solutions to constantly improve
BEUDO. our plan for this hearing was to express support for the November 2021 amendments with a request
for continued collaboration on a few remaining issues. those topics include clarity around the emissions
baseline. the role of carbon offset credit products and further development of the alternative compliance credit.
we have every confidence that we can address these matters together to our mutual satisfaction just as we have
for a multitude of details over the past several years.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: thank you. okay. I’m going to go to Councillor Zondervan then I have a thought.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair and to my colleagues on the committee. my suggestion
was and remains that we keep this matter in committee. we will schedule another hearing and will have time in
between to talk with anyone who would like to discuss these matters in more detail. and I do take some issue
with the scolding that we are receiving on not reaching out because people know our phone numbers and they
can reach out to us as well. I’m happy to proceed in that way and I think we will have plenty of opportunity for
dialogue before we bring this forward.

>> Patricia M. Nolan: thank you and thank every single public speaker. I do want to respond. I totally
understand and endorsed, and I know the frustration. I will remind people that agenda was public last week. it is
true though that this specifics of this were not known until that agenda was public last week. I think if we keep
this in committee… I also want to do as chair of the health environment committee have it be more of a
roundtable to any player including from both Harvard and MIT. have those discussions. I do want to remind all
of us that if we do want an open and transparent process my understanding is that those 40 meetings were
closed-door meetings that were not in the public domain. there were only with building owners. CPAC was not
involved. Net zero action task force was not involved. The climate crisis working group was not involved. The
city council was not involved. That was not an open and transparent process with all the stakeholders of the
table. that's where we need to go next. that process led to particular amendments. which some of us are now
saying we need to be changed in the face of again the IPCC latest report issued last year which literally says,
"code red for humanity”. so, I understand all of us want to get there. and the question is how to get there. I want
to have those discussions. I want us to get there. I want Harvard, MIT, all the building owners in the city to be
with us at the table. I know many of my colleagues committed to that. let's not throw this out as an idea that we
shouldn't endorse something that the rest of the city didn't even vet before it was just put on the table. once it
was put on the table some of us came together working with a range of people across the city. I was not just out
of our heads. it was working with a range of experts across the city. I agree there are lots of questions to ask
about electric capacity. about how we are doing it. I would love to keep this in committee but also letting my
colleagues know if you think that makes sense that that is the appropriate venue to have very quickly as soon as
we can schedule it a health and environment committee meeting and run it like a roundtable and specifically
invite any of the folks were in those 40 meetings if they would come and talk about and Eversource and the city.
>> Dennis J. Carlone: thank you Co-Chair. I think the issues raised primarily by the institutions are fair. I think
my colleagues have responded in part but as Councillor Nolan was referring to, I think the people we talk to
need to show up at this roundtable. it might be that I have some background in green architecture but not in all
of these fields. that is for sure. and we do need the experts to talk about this. we are not saying just accept it
because it is submitted by us. we have to have these discussions but at the end it's only about our world and our
city and nothing is more important than this and trying to push the effort forward to me if we can make this
work, why not? that's really what it comes down to. if we can clean up the air sooner, why not? that is what this
is about. yes, there's been negotiation as my fellow councilors have said we've not been a part of that. and we
are the ones that make those decisions. final decisions. we have to influence each other in the right way. thank
you.
>> Burhan Azeem: thank you Mr. chair. apologies for not using the hand thing my zoom isn't working. I had
two questions for the city or mainly for the city but also if the amendment makers want to answer that is fine as
well. I’m curious why these amendments, why the original proposal focuses only on large buildings rather than
small buildings considering they also are a large producer of emissions. on top of that why transportation
emissions are not included. my sense is if you have an empty parking lots would be easier for to qualify for
these than the equivalent house just because the empty parking lot uses less construction materials but obviously
is used for transmitting relating more gas-powered vehicles. so, its fine if it doesn't fit into this particular
version. I was just curious why those were left out of the original proposal.

>> Seth Federspiel: again, net zero action… I will take those two-question reversed. the net zero action plans
are exclusively focused on building emissions. which again are about 83% of the cities emissions we are in the
process of developing a net zero transportation plan that will address the transportation sector but that's a
separate process. not that it's not being considered, just not part of this policy. in terms of the building size
threshold the building energy use disclosure ordinance that is in effect and was adopted in 2014 applies to
specifically to the largest buildings in Cambridge. the commercial buildings 25,000 square ft. or greater. and
residential buildings larger than 50 units. those buildings account for about 70% of the building sector
emissions. even though they're only about 6% of the number of buildings. so, the proposal the original proposal
from CDD does not propose any changes to those thresholds.
>> Burhan Azeem: through you my chair the reason I ask… I forget the exact number but 8% of our buildings
are responsible for 60% of the emissions but in the original slide you showed it was really about square footage.
To me the square footage of the buildings roughly corresponds with the percent of emissions to the large

>> Seth Federspiel: again, this was considered at some length when the BEUDO ordinance was originally
adopted. consideration of the balancing point between what is asked of building owners and how many building
owners would be required to take those actions. and so, the 25,000 square-foot and 50 units thresholds were
established to capture again that bulk of the square footage that you mention while requiring a relatively small
number of building owners to go through the administrative process to do that reporting. and in terms of
addressing emissions from all the buildings in the city that's where the full net zero action plan is really
important to consider all of the different actions. For buildings of that are smaller than the BEUDO threshold,
the updated next zero action plan proposes that we consider transaction point-based requirements. for those
smaller buildings when they're being sold or renovated or leased could use those natural turnover points as
opportunities for upgrades lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I’m going to go to mayor Siddiqui it looks like you're coming to us from a
bunker.
>> mayor Siddiqui: I’m fine with keeping this in committee. I will say on this topic. we've… the council and
past councils have talked about various issues, everything from the linkage fee and increasing it to. to this issue
where fundamentally sometimes there is disagreement and partnership may not be able to happen. with that said
I think it is important to have our partners at the table and help us think through a lot of different decision points
but ultimately from what I’ve seen is that on this topic there have been a ton of meetings and there is a sense
from a number of individuals, activists who feel like they haven't been heard. They are invited to the table but
there is fundamental disagreement. we should definitely keep having a conversation about these amendments
and at the end of the day… I think ultimately, we have to vote these up and down. and I think there may not be
consensus here. I think this is just the reality of the situation. if were looking for consensus on this based on
everything, I’ve heard in all the meetings that have happened. I am not sure that exists. and it is important to
hear from and have further conversations. I will stop there but I’m happy to keep this in committee as we
planned. not to vote in anything tonight.
>> Paul F. Toner: thank you Mr. cochair. I’m going to throw my I’m the new guy card in the table. I’m hearing
that there were 40 meetings over four years but for some reason city councilors were not invited and other folks
were not invited to the meetings. I’m not clear on that of why that is the case. but I do want to encourage
Councillor Nolan that if we are not going to take it out of the ordinance committee that you have that hearing.
At least from this my experience and my first ordinance meeting this doesn't seem like the appropriate venue to
actually get to the real core issues about what can and can't be done, what's realistic? what's practical? I’m not
suggesting that everybody's going to agree but it sounds like according to the mayor, that even activists felt like
they weren't heard. if there's an opportunity to have a different venue to talk about these issues and get
everybody's input before we finally vote on it, I would appreciate that going forward.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: what it was going to suggest…we said from the beginning it was going to be
another ordinance committee meeting nothing was advancing today. that was clear from the beginning. so, we
can keep this in committee and send the subject matter to health and environment chaired by Councillor Nolan
so that she can bring it up at that meeting or is that unnecessary, can we just keep it in committee, then she just
calls her own meeting? obviously the goal being… I would think Councillor Nolan that you call that meeting
soon. before the next ordinance committee meeting so we have whatever comes out of that meeting if other
things need to be amended or adjusted, we have that for the next ordinance committee meeting. so, Mr. clerk is
there any procedural thing, or can Councillor Nolan just call that meeting… now that it is in ordinance do, we
have to do anything to send back or can it just happen.

commercial large buildings in general exceed 2% of us were footage in the city they were like 70% of the
emissions. I don't see a great disparity between the surface area of these sizes. I’m wondering… I’m worried a
little bit that triple-deckers for example don't get included but once you get the four or five stories… whatever
the threshold is it seems a little bit arbitrary is there a reason to not include smaller buildings?

>> Anthony Ivan Wilson, clerk: through you my chair there is no procedural motion that needs to happen. i
would caution that may be talk to, I don't know if there's anybody from the law department on the call. this is a
process predicated under the general laws. I don't know if it precludes something like that. my one point of
caution for the council.

Ordinance Committee

February 9, 2022

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: anyone from the solicitor's office.
>> Megan Bayerle corrects me if I’m wrong, but I don't believe this is not a zoning petition.

>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: just to comment. i know this is radical in the political landscape that we are in
these days. maybe we should try to assume good intentions and everybody's part instead of bad intentions on
everybody's part. what makes Cambridge great this we heard this from a new commissioner of public health
came here from Texas it's great to be in a city where you don't have to convince people that science is real. I
don't think that anybody even those councilors will raise questions about the process and who spoke to… is
saying we don't believe the science and want to delay this as long as possible. we can try not to… just because
somebody asked the question or raises a concern doesn't mean that they don't agree with what the ultimate goals
are. and if so, let's not do that to each other as this goes forward. and I think that was ultimately going to make
the leader in this. by asking a question like okay we’re going for 2035 is that possible? that is not my saying that
I think climate change doesn't exist and it's a hoax. It is my asking are we setting a goal they can actually be
achieved and help me understand it. let's not do that to each other in this conversation. it is too important.
Councillor Zondervan I will go to you. So, it sounds like I guess one of the questions with answers we want to
recess or adjourn? again the implication of that is if we recess the next meeting will be a direct continuation of
this meeting which means no public comments, or we adjourn and we come back and we can pick it up where
we left off and have public comment those are the only… I believe the only two significant differences with
either of those decisions.
>> Quinton Y. Zondervan, chair: thank you Mr. chair I’m happy to make a motion to adjourn once we are ready
for that. I don't think we should recess as we have been talking about there's a lot of further public conversation
that needs to happen. I certainly don't want to avoid the public comment in our next meeting. I want to agree
with you wholeheartedly. I don't question any of my colleagues’ intentions. I don't doubt that we understand the
challenges that we face with climate crisis. I do think that there are commercial interests that are protecting
themselves. that is their job. we need to have that conversation but as the mayor said at the end of the day, we
have to decide which way we want to go on this, that is our job… our responsibility. I’m perfectly happy to
have a hearing on this in Councillor Nolan's committee. I think it would be great. I do want also to point out that
in the ordinance committee routinely developers make presentations to us about their projects. there is nothing
preventing us from inviting building owners and developers to come to the next hearing and make a
presentation about their concerns and questions and again we can have conversations off-line as well about any
concerns that they have about it. I look forward to those conversations. regardless of the outcome we are all
learning and growing on this issue by having those conversations.
>> vice mayor Mallon: thank you Mr. chair was also going to throw my support behind adjourning rather than
recessing that seems like that is a motion on the table. I will yield back.
>> Marc C. McGovern, chair: I would say Councillor Zondervan I think you're right. I think we could have
another ordinance committee meeting and have Harvard, MIT or whoever come. I would prefer to do it in
another committee just so that we can… what comes back ordinance might be the same amendments, it might
be different. To have a presentation in ordinance and then there's not a lot of time to discuss it and do the work
so I think do that work in the subcommittee bring it to ordinance ready to go and there may be nothing that
changes, I don't know. we're sort of… correct me if I’m wrong Councillor Zondervan we are scheduling
ordinance committee meetings out until the end of march at this point. so, there is not a ton of time for… a little
bit of time you can even have more than one meeting.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 9, 2022 5:30 PM (On the Table)

>> Anthony Ivan Wilson, clerk: I apologize. sorry about that.

>> Burhan Azeem: sorry I have a problem with a hand feature on zoom. I would put it up as I could. through
you Mr. Chair I would be interested, if possible, to hear that city's response to the amendments. The
presentation covered by the city was mostly for the original version that the amendments. and I’d be curious to
hear what the city is thinking about those amendments I’m not sure if that's possible, but I’d be interested if it is.

CMA 2022 #72
IN CITY COUNCIL
April 25, 2022
Ordered:

That section 6.04.020 of the Municipal Ordinances of the City of Cambridge
entitled “Dogs-License required-Fee” be amended to read as follows:
6.04.020 Dogs-License required-Fee.
Every dog six months old or over shall be licensed
pursuant to G.L. c. 140, § 137. As proof that the dog has been
spayed or neutered, the owner or keeper shall present to the
Director of the Animal Commission ("Director") or his or her
designee a certificate of the registered veterinarian who
performed the operation. Effective June 1, 2015, the fee for
such license shall, except as otherwise provided, be ten dollars
for a spayed or neutered dog and thirty dollars for a dog that is
not spayed or neutered. If the Director or his or her designee is
satisfied that the certificate of the veterinarian who performed
the operation cannot be obtained, he or she may accept in lieu
thereof a sworn statement of a veterinarian registered and
practicing in the Commonwealth, describing the dog, and
stating that he or she has examined the dog and that, in his or
her opinion, it has been spayed or neutered. Pursuant to G.L. c.
140, § 139, no fee shall be charged for a license issued under
this section for a service animal as defined by the Americans
with Disabilities Act or regulations promulgated thereunder or
for dog owners aged 70 years or older. No part of the fee shall
be refunded because of the subsequent death, loss, spaying,
castration, removal from the Commonwealth or other disposal
of the dog. Nor shall any part of the fee paid by mistake be
refunded.

The Cambridge Transportation De-Carbonization and Congestion-Mitigation Bill
Purpose: The Purpose of this bill is to further Cambridge’s efforts to decarbonize
transportation, to mitigate traffic congestion and to decrease parking demands
by allowing commercial use of privately-owned electric vehicle charging stations
in residential districts and by allowing rental of shared-use micromobility
devices in residential districts.
Petition Text is as follows:
Publicly-accessible, Privately-owned Electric Vehicle Charging System. An electric vehicle
charging system and its attendant parking spot located on privately owned property that is
available, for free or through a financial transaction, to members of the general public for the
sole purpose of charging an electric vehicle owned by an entity other than the property owner.
Electric vehicle. Any vehicle that is licensed and registered for operation on public and private
highways, roads, or streets and that operates exclusively on electrical energy from an off-board
source that is stored in the vehicle’s batteries, producing zero tailpipe emissions or pollution
when stationary or operating.
Shared Vehicle. Any privately-owned vehicle that is licensed and registered for operation on
public and private highways, roads, and streets that is available, for free or through a financial
transaction, to members of the general public through a shared mobility platform. A shared
vehicle does not include Carsharing Vehicles and Organizations as regulated in Section 6.24.
Shared Mobility Device. A mobility device such as a scooter, bicycle, or other transportation
device that is not legal to operate on public highways that is made available for personal use to
members or customers through a self-service automated reservation system, for free or
through a financial transaction, but not by means of a separate written agreement that is
entered into each time a device is operated by a member or customer. A Shared Mobility Device
must be owned, maintained or operated by, and made available through, a Shared Mobility
Platform.
Shared Mobility Platform. An entity with a distributed fleet of Shared Mobility Devices, either
owned by or made available through the Platform, that charges a use-based fee related to a

CDD website which shows 7.54 miles of separated bike lanes to date. So, now one has to comb through TP&T, DPW and
CDD websites as well as submitting Public Records Requests in order to put together the puzzle of Cycling Safety
Ordinance implementation. It would be very useful to have one central website with links to others to help
Cantabridgians to see the whole picture and to see how much it is costing to build and maintain 101.70 miles of New
and Current Bicycle Projects..
I beg you to please fill in the blanks in the attached, updated file at your earliest convenience (would appreciate edits in
different color)
Here are some specific questions:
1. Projects - City of Cambridge, MA (cambridgema.gov states "Completed Before the Ordinance Took Effect This
table only provides details about street segments that are specifically called out in the Ordinance." Could you
confirm this means these segments are part of the goal of 25 miles?
2. How do you account for the length of one direction of two directional streets such as Mass Ave from Everett St
to Waterhouse St. The northbound side was done before the Ordinance took effect but the southbound is part
of Future Projects (Ongoing Community Engagement). Should we say the goal is 50 miles and double the
lengths of bidirectional streets?
3. Scope of Work for Contract 8412CC included separated bike lanes for Mt. Auburn Street from JFK Street to
Putnam Street but I can't find it in Projects - City of Cambridge, MA (cambridgema.gov),
4. Scope of Work for Contract 8412III included separated bike lanes for Brattle Street from Fresh Pond to Mason
Street but I can't find it in Projects - City of Cambridge, MA (cambridgema.gov),
Thank you for your attention to this matter,
Respectfully your,
Young Kim

I would also appreciate your help with the "Unknowns" in the CSO Implementation History worksheet of the attached
document. Any data you can provide by updating the worksheet (please use red) will be greatly
appreciated. Furthermore, including this information on Cycling Safety Ordinance Projects would be very useful.

Dear Mayor, City Manager, City Councillors and City Clerk,
I am writing to you on tonight’s City Manager's Agenda (CMA) Items #2 and #3 to ask you to change the
Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) implementation process so that CSO goals and other stakeholders’ goals are
aligned. City Manager (CM) will be asking $55 million for 2.51 miles of MassAve4 projects in the
recommended budget for FY23 he will be submitting shortly. For a project with such a large expenditure, we

should proceed with utmost fiscal responsibility, transparency and with due consideration for all stakeholders
and get the project done right the first time. Please pause MassAve4 and Porter Square projects and resume
when all of the following are completed as a precedence for “breaking” the timeline for the CSO
implementation has already been established by CM on Porter Square Project:
1.
CM justifies $55 million budget for MassAve4 project and discloses cost of all CSO
implementation projects (see CSO Implementation History worksheet of attached 4_11_22 CC
Comment Backup).
2.
Better Designer Selection Process has been established and new Traffic/Transportation/Parking
designers have been selected- (see attached email dated Mar 30, 2022)
3.
Pre-construction data according to the study “to collect relevant economic data relating to
business impacts from bike lane installations” (CMA #3) have been collected in these two areas to
establish baseline
4.
The findings of the Cycling Safety Ordinance Implementation Advisory Committee have been
incorporated.
5.
Agreement with MBTA has been reached on a schedule that will allow the projects to proceed in
parallel with MBTA’s removal of catenary wires and supporting infrastructure.
In addition, please reject CMA #3 as “a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business impacts
from bike lane installations” should be carried out independently from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation
Department whose implementation on Mass Ave Dudley Street – Alewife Brook Parkway project resulted in the
City Council requesting the study. The Department should have no part in selecting the “consultant to help
gather data and conduct this analysis” nor approving “methodology on conducting its research and consider a
variety of data used in bike lane installation economic analyses” developed by the consultant.
Finally, I am writing to urge you to reject CMA #4 and ask CM to report back on a comprehensive plan for the
City to purchase Lesley University’s properties “to address City goals” as originally intended in Policy Order
(PO) #4 dated October 18, 2021.
Thank you for your consideration for the above. Below are further explanations of the above.
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim
17 Norris Street
CMA #2
Please consider $55 million for 2.51 miles of MassAve4 project in context of FY22 budget. The residential tax
levy for FY21 was $180.2 million (fy22taxrateletterexecutivesummary.pdf (cambridgema.gov) &
fy22understandingyourtaxnewsletter.pdf (cambridgema.gov)) which means 30.5% of our tax money will be
used for 2.51 miles of projected 25 miles of separated bike lanes. To put it another way, 23.7% of FY22
operating budget for education will be spent for 10% of projected separated bike lanes.
All the Engineering Support “House Doctor” contracts, obtained through Public Records requests, were done
under triennial Agreement for General Engineering Services (Agreement). The current Agreement was signed
on 5/20/2019 so it is due to expire shortly. Complex and costly Traffic/Transportation/Parking (Transportation)
related issues deserve its own Request for Qualification (RFQ) to attract qualified transportation
consultants. The Purchasing Department has recommended short listed potential contractors for the 20222025 Agreement to CM for his final approval. RFQ for this Agreement was so broad and open ended that only
9 out of 34 bidders submitted proposals and of those six have been shortlisted. And half of those six
contractors have been awarded the Agreement since 2013 when the Designer Selection Statutes (M.G.L. c
7C, §§ 44-58) became effective. Kleinfelder, one of those three contractors, is the House Doctor for MassAve4
Project and northern Mass Ave Project. I have no doubt Kleinfelder is well qualified general engineering
consultants but I am equally sure there are many other well qualified Transportation consultants who will be

CM reported in CMA #2 that pending City Council approval, the MassAve4 segments will proceed into the
design stage. Kleinfelder has been working on the MassAve4 Project since 8/13/2021 to be completed by
5/1/2021 at contract value of $1,121,196.00 (File No, 8412QQQ). According to Kleinfelder’s proposal, “the
scope includes project management, data collection/survey and existing condition/survey and existing
conditions assessment, conceptual and final design for the Mass4 Sections C and D and Eliot Street, a
Functional Design Report for the Mass4 Sections A and B, and assistance with the public process, including
transit/pedestrian/bicycle committee and City Council meetings.” What will happen to their work up to
date? Will Klinefelter's contract be extended to rework their plans to incorporate recent community
engagement results? Or wouldn’t it be better to select a new traffic specific contractor to carry on the work?
CMA #4
Policy Order (PO) #4 dated October 18, 2021 did not ask CM to help Homeowners Rehab, Inc. (HRI) purchase
a property from Lesley to develop affordable housing. Nor are affordable housing the only City goals. After
discussing with Lesley University and identifying potential properties to purchase, CM should have reported
those properties and their potential uses to the City Council. Upon approval from the City Council, City should
have purchased available properties directly from Lesley and then plan on how they can be used to “address
City Goals” with input from the community. If a property could be used for affordable housing, for example, the
City should be planning such development with the input from all stakeholders including and most importantly
the community; conduct traffic, parking and other impact studies. Once a conceptual plan is formulated, then it
should be put out as an open, competitive bid to developers, for-profit as well as non-profit, to carry the plan to
completion “to ensure the best possible outcome for the community.”

Re: QuickBuild parking proposal -petition from mental health clinicians

Dear Janet and Colleagues:
Thank you for speaking out to the City Council and other city officials. Their policies have been extremely short-sighted
with regard to the needs of the mental health community and all those who need access to services. I know that your
list of signers is but a fraction of the mental health professionals impacted by the Quick Build Bike Lanes. Add to your
constituents dozens of medical, dental, acupuncture, physical and occupational therapy specialists many of whom
occupy offices in reconfigured houses and anonymous buildings along Mass Ave that our elected officials have
completely overlooked as essential places of business.
We are all in this together and must keep speaking up, no matter what the city keeps doing. The future of Cambridge
depends on us.
Thanks,
Vickey Bestor

Dear City Manager, City Traffic Manager and City Council Members,

We, the undersigned, are psychologists, clinical social workers and psychiatrists,
treating children, adolescents, adults and senior citizens in our offices in the area
between Shepherd Street and Porter Square. As you may well be aware, there is a
severe mental health crisis in our community. The demand for mental health
services has skyrocketed in the last few years and we provide essential care to
those from Cambridge and local environs.

Our patients arrive at our offices predominantly by car, although some are able to
come by public transport and, especially when the weather is good, some are able
to come by bicycle. For most of them, and most of the time, the availability of onsite parking - for at least an hour - is vital. Removal of half of the parking meters
near our offices will make it much more difficult for most of our patients to access
our mental health services.
The City's proposed removal of this parking - without any consultation with any of
us - will be enormously disruptive to us and to our patients. It may well force us to
relocate our practices to other towns. This will result in a significant loss of mental
health care in Cambridge, already experiencing a scarcity of mental health
treatment.
We concur with the desire for safer travel for all – bicyclists, public transportation,
pedestrians, and cars. We respectfully request that the City Council conduct clear
impact studies and provide our community with a transparent project plan to
create equitable options that do not destroy the health care and business vitality
of the area. Please open avenues for community involvement to find traffic
solutions that do not disproportionally impact and disrupt the established mental
health care in this area.

Please see below for my public comment statement, made during the April 20th Finance Committee Meeting.
Thank you.

My name is Tobin Scipione. I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at Community Servings.
In your decision-making of the city’s ARPA funding, we strongly encourage the committee to
consider the food and nutrition security of those who are mobility-impaired and too sick to
access traditional food security programs like food banks or congregate meal sites. Community
Servings has a long history of providing home-delivered medically tailored meals to Cambridge
residents experiencing poverty and a critical or chronic illness. Since 1999, we have provided
nearly 500,000 home-delivered medically tailored meals to Cambridge residents working with
multiple Cambridge-based health and social service referral partners.
Community Servings' home-delivered medically tailored meal model addresses the critical
issues of food insecurity and poor nutrition, key social determinants of health that have
profound impacts on an individual’s health and wellbeing. As you identify key investments
with the city’s ARPA funding allocation, we ask you to consider support for Cambridge
residents who are severely immune-compromised and nutrition insecure. These residents
have faced enormous challenges due to COVID-19, and accompanying economic disruption
and rates of food insecurity are expected to remain at historic levels for years, with long-term
health consequences. ARPA funding, in the amount of $250,000 over five years, will support
the home-delivery of 125,000 medically tailored meals, customized to meet the individual
health needs of 250+ Cambridge clients, their dependent children, and caregivers over the
funding period. This funding will help drive health equity by addressing longstanding
disparities in food access which have been exacerbated by COVID-19.

Please support Partial Reconstruction for MassAve4

To the Cambridge City Council:
I urge you to support the Partial Reconstruction option for MassAve4. It's critical that Cambridge make bus, bike, and
pedestrian improvements to get people out of cars - both to address the climate emergency and to prevent injuries and
deaths caused by drivers.
Thank you,

Fwd: ARPA funding for HEART

To the Finance Committee, City Council, and City Manager:
I am writing to request that the City Council and City Manager of Cambridge support the Cambridge
HEART program with 5.5 million of the 88 million dollars in ARPA funding.
HEART is a community-based alternative public safety program that will strengthen Cambridge during
the pandemic recovery because it is peer led by the communities most impacted by crisis: disabled
communities, communities of color, houseless communities and youth communities. It already
provides employment, education, and training to those who provide services and, with funding from
ARPA, it can do much more.
With its restorative and transformative practices, the HEART program addresses needs such as
housing, mutual aid, transportation to services, and conflict resolution, and it provides jobs to those in
our community who have the greatest needs. The HEART program avoids disciplinary and
unnecessary interaction with carceral systems but utilizes professional resources, as necessary, to
aid those who deliver services and to aid the recipients of services.
The HEART program developed out of a collaborative process with impacted community members in
Cambridge, with service providers and with community organizations. It utilizes an evidence-based
program that is modelled after community-based public safety and crisis assistance programs in other
cities –all with proven track records.
Please reserve $5.5 million of ARPA funding for the HEART program.

Re: bike lanes on Mass. Ave

Dear City Councilors
Whatever your final decision is regarding proposed bike lanes between Harvard Sq. and Porter Sq., please remember
those of us who shop in that area but do not live within walking distance of it.
Parking one’s car safely while supporting local shops is very important, especially to those of us who are seniors.
I also used to attend evening concerts at Harvard Epworth church, but parking nearby became ever more difficult since
many nearby parking meters were removed. At a certain age, it becomes more difficult to park far away and to have to
walk distances in the dark, especially in winter.
Please remember that you represent all of us living in Cambridge, and not principally cyclists. We too need your help
getting safely to shops and churches in the area between the two squares.
Thank you for your work,
Shelagh Hadley, longtime Cambridge resident and voter

Re: Letter City Council

Dear Patty,
I respectfully disagree with your assumption that businesses can survive with a reduction of 50-60 percent of the
current parking. How do you draw that conclusion? All of my tenants in Porter Square and other businesses I have
spoken with are quite certain that this is not sustainable. Please explain the data you have that shows this reduction is
sustainable.
I find it had to believe that the city that has supported local businesses during Covid and has worked to improve retail
storefronts, would think about removing 50%-60% of their customer parking plus loading areas on Mass Avenue. The
City's own 2020 study of the Porter Square and lower Mass Avenue Commercial District states that businesses
need more parking not less to thrive. Do the studies that the City conducts really matter? The City states that their
assessments are done to support businesses in their planning for the future. however this does not seem to be
the case in 2022, with the City considering removing all or best case scenario 50% of customer parking.
You have the awesome responsibility of being able to extinguish people's livelihoods by removing 50 % of the
parking when your own studies show that more not less parking is needed to maintain a vibrant commercial
fabric in our neighborhoods.
Also the city demographics listed in this same 2020 study show that only 219 live and work in this area (Porter
and lower Mass Ave) and approximately 6,000 work in here and live elsewhere, while 9,000 live in this area of
Cambridge and work elsewhere. Therefore the need for parking for residents and workers of businesses is
indisputable. Where other countries have worked to reduce cars, this has been done with a comprehensive city plan
over 15 years where parking is gradually reduced 3% a year, not 60% over a few years. If you are concerned about the
environment, why not focus on electric cars and electric charging stations, rather than putting people out of business.
The changes that the City has been voting to approve as part of the Cycling Safety Ordinance will certainly put
neighborhood retail and service providers out of business or drive them from Cambridge in order to
survive. This will change the very fabric of the neighborhood that we hold dear. If you end the vibrancy of the
mixed use character of neighborhoods that is a destination to many, Cambridge will be forever changed. If this is the
direction that the city is going, shouldn't this be a decision of the residents of Cambridge, not 8% of the

Then there is the issue of cost! $20 million a mile for bike lanes, that many bikers have said don't make they really feel
safer. If you are really concerned about safety of bikers, why doesn't the city require Bike helmets which are shown to
save lives. What about the safety of pedestrians and others who don't bike? Where the protected bikes lanes have been
installed on North Mass Ave, there have been several car crashes do to the confusion of the bus lanes, protected
bike lanes, confusing signage, and travel lanes. And then there is the issue of more congestion and emissions do to the
reduction of travel lanes. What is the budget for the whole Cycling Safety Ordinance? With the cost at 20 million a
mile this is over a Half Billion dollars for 8% of the Population. What about other social issues: The Opioid Crisis,
Mental Health Services, the clean-up of the Alewife Brook watershed that is dumping 50 million gallons of
sewerage into our watershed? What are the city's priorities? Do these match the residents' priorities that you
serve? Do you care? The last few years folks have been struggling to survive Covid. There are many needs for services
to deal with the aftermath of this crisis in people's lives. Please think, plan, and vote for the 92% of regular hard
working folks that are trying to get on with their lives and make a better future for themselves and their
children. Please help the 92% you were elected to serve.
Respectfully,
Sharon Cerny

Dear Sharon Cerny,
Thank you for writing in about the plan for a network of bike lanes throughout Cambridge. As you may know, the City
Manager recently provided the Council with an update on the MassAve4 project, asking for the Council’s approval on
the approach and timeline. Per the report, the recommendation is to implement separated bike lanes through partial
construction for the segments of Mass Ave with the overhead MBTA bus wires and the media, and full construction for
the Harvard Square bus stops. With this recommended approach, the median and overhead wires will be removed,
which means 40 to 50% of parking will be retained on this segment of Mass Ave. This reduction will be challenging, but
workable, and the city has committed to working with residents and businesses during the year planning process.
I am very supportive of a network of protected of protected bike lanes throughout the City, and am particularly grateful
for all the work that Mass Ave for All has done to include community input. In terms of this particular plan, I will be
voting in favor, in part because of the increased timeline. The extra year of planning will allow us time to ensure input
from the stakeholder group we voted to convene, and get the results from an economic impact analysis.
I noted at last night’s meeting that currently only 8% of Cambridge residents, and just 5% of Cambridge workers
commute to work by bicycle, which needs to increase if we are to reach our goals of fewer transportation
emissions. About half of Cambridge residents use a bicycle 1 or 2 times a month, which alone is not enough in my
opinion to justify spending $55 million on just this phase of the expansion of bike lanes. If we are to realize the vision of
a city with much reduced emissions, we need to consciously work to reduce car use. I believe we should set specific
goals around those metrics – That means increasing bicycle use, public transit use, and walking. Part of this planning has
to include a plan to ensure that the bike lanes are used by more people, and that fewer people use their car in
Cambridge; if we don’t decrease car usage, we have failed.
And we must work to understand and meet the needs of residents who rely on cars now, as well as small businesses
whose customers rely on cars. I believe we can do it, with more time and a focused attention on a truly inclusive
process. I know that change will be difficult, as we move away from a car-centered city. I know there will be adverse
consequences for some. We need to work to minimize the adverse consequences even as we hold onto the goal of a city
less reliant on and less catering to cars.

Community as you stated last evening? Should this not be a referendum item for the next election? Is the City Council
not responsible to all the residents? Shouldn't residents decide what they want for the future of their city?

Dear Councilors and City Officials.
I am writing to express my concerns regarding Porter Square Quick-Build and Plans A and B for Mass Ave 4.
Regarding Porter, the removal of parking along Mass Avenue from Beech to Roseland will be the death nil for
those businesses that are still hanging on after Covid. Approximately half of the 30 storefronts in Porter are
currently closed or empty with little hope of being re-leased with the substantial reduction in street
parking. Removing the existing 34 parking spaces on Mass Ave and replacing them with two spaces on Upland
(which necessitates giving up a right-hand turn lane in this busy intersection) and adding a few meters on Mt
Vernon (which will reduce resident parking and increase congestion in a residential neighborhood)

And then there is the fact that you would be proceeding with No Community Advisory Board or Impact Study as
promised. For although the City Council passed resolutions in early January to establish a Community Advisory Board
and later ordered an Economic Impact Study for the bike lane construction, the Quick-Build construction appears to
continue without either of these critical inputs.
The City states in their 2020 Porter Square and Lower Mass. Ave. Commercial District Assessment:
"This assessment provides the City, local businesses, and local property owners with a better understanding
of how Porter Square & Lower Massachusetts Ave. visitors and residents utilize the district and how they would
like the district to evolve in the future. Data in this report will also assist business owners seeking a location in Porter
Square and Lower Mass. Ave. and help current business owners understand potential opportunities for growth."
In this Assessment when businesses were asked "What changes do you think need to occur in or around
the corridor to attract more shoppers/". 70% replied PARKING.
As we all know, the plans for Porter for installation of bike lanes remove all the parking from Mass Ave, and on
lower Mass Ave, the best we can hope for is a reduction of 50%. This reduction is unsustainable for business.
Where parking has been removed for bike lanes in the City, sales are off 30-40%, and in some cases more, since
their installation. Despite statements from the cycling community, there is no evidence to date that lost revenues
are being offset from their increased patronage where separated bike lanes have been installed.
So why did the City spend taxpayer dollars for an assessment that they were going to totally ignore? Why lead
taxpayers to believe they have input into the future of their neighborhoods, when the City is doing the opposite
of this survey’s results/
This report also asked shoppers: "How do you usually travel to get to Porter Square/Lower Massachusetts Ave?
The responses where as follows: 33% drive, 19% by bus, 16% subway, 16% bike.
Couple this with the following demographic of this area from the same report regarding Commuting Patterns:
5,983 Work in Porter/lower Mass Ave and live elsewhere.
216 Live and Work in Porter/lower Mass Ave.
9,029 Live in Porter Square/lower Mass. Ave. and work elsewhere.

is unconscionable. This is being done with no economic impact analysis on the businesses and no traffic,
parking, safety or environmental studies for the neighborhoods. Plus there is no real community involvement;
just city presentations on what the City Plan options are, rather than involvement in developing a plan based on
hard data from professional engineers and analysts plus data from businesses and residents who are being
affected. Here is a list of storefronts that your actions are affecting.

It isn't rocket science that residents and business need their existing parking.
Also the MASSINC, a poll often quoted by the Bike Advocacy groups, states that the street uses residents are most
interested in expanding are outdoor seating (83%) and dining (79%), which were ahead of creating bike lanes

Further according to CMA 2022#74, the City is requesting an additional $40 Million of taxpayers money for bike
lane construction of 1.8 miles of Part A and B of the MASS AVE4. This is over $20 MILLION per mile. So what is
the cost of the overall Cycling Safety Ordinance? No one seems to know, There is no budget of which I am
aware. So where is all the money coming from that we don't need to budget it. What other programs are being
neglected? All this for a minority of the population? Why? Why? Why?
They are many questions and few if any answers from the City Council and City Officials. I would like you to be
accountable. The businesses and residents of Cambridge deserve your respect and your answers.

Opposing Removal of Parking from Mass Ave

As a resident of Cambridge I do not support a plan that will remove 50-60% of parking from Mass Ave. A design needs to
be found that allows for safe streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and disabled. If the
requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets these goals the
ordinance needs to be changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should include an automatic deadline extension so no
construction starts until after the MBTA wires are removed.

Parking on Mass Ave

Dear All,
I frequently shop, eat, entertain in Cambridge - I also make use of many services there (acupuncture, professional
services etc). I do not support a plan that will remove all metered parking between Beech Street and Roseland on Mass
Ave. Porter Square has already been redesigned within the last few years to increase bicycle safety. The MBTA wires are
already deactivited, we need to have them removed so Parking can be retained on Mass Ave. We have the time to do
this right. A design needs to be found that allows for safe streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly
and disabled. If the requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets
these goals the ordinance needs to be changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should include an automatic deadline
extension so no more separated Bicycle lanes are started until after the MBTA wires are removed.

Please Submit as a Communication to be read at Monday's City Council Meeting

To Whom It May Concern:

As a resident of Cambridge since 1986, I do not support a plan that will remove all
metered parking between Beech Street and Roseland on Mass Ave. Porter Square has
already been redesigned within the last few years to increase bicycle safety. The MBTA
wires are already deactivated we need to have them removed so Parking can be retained
on Mass Ave. We have the time to do this right. A design needs to be found that allows for
safe streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and disabled. If the
requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that
meets these goals the ordinance needs to be changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should
include an automatic deadline extension so no more separated Bicycle lanes are started
until after the MBTA wires are removed.
I try not to drive down Mass Ave now. I live on Rindgefield Street, so driving on Mass Ave
is the best way for me to get anywhere. I fear making right hand turns off of Mass
Ave (especially where there is no traffic light). I look to make sure no bikers are in the
bike lane but it is difficult to see them and I must slow down which can easily cause
an accident with the car behind me. Turning on to Cameron Ave (the route I take to
rte 93) is extremely dangerous. I have to cross over the bus and bike lanes....when do I
get into the bus lane to make the turn....often there is a car already in the bus lane, so
what do I do ? Slow down which can be a problem with cars behind me ?? We MUST
stop putting in these bike lanes and come up with a plan that will be safe for all
modes of transportation. We cannot remove so many parking spaces..... we should
be working to help the small businesses along Mass Ave, not making it difficult for
people to shop at these shops.

services etc). I do not support a plan that will remove all metered parking between Beech Street and Roseland on Mass
Ave. Porter Square has already been redesigned within the last few years to increase bicycle safety. The MBTA wires are
already deactivited, we need to have them removed so Parking can be retained on Mass Ave. We have the time to do
this right. A design needs to be found that allows for safe streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly
and disabled. If the requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets
these goals the ordinance needs to be changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should include an automatic deadline
extension so no more separated Bicycle lanes are started until after the MBTA wires are removed.
Thank you

Please Vote for Bike Lanes on Mass Ave

Dear councilmembers and city staff,
I'm a Cambridge resident writing to express my support for the reconstruction proposal to add protected bike lanes to
the remainder of Mass Ave. Although I am not an avid biker, I can still the obvious benefits that bikes lanes bring to any
community by increasing safety for everyone on the road—bikers, pedestrians, and drivers alike. Voting against the
proposal is a vote against safety for the Cambridge community, and I hope that you will all vote in favor of city
staff's proposal. I appreciate your hard work on this issue and look forward to the proposal passing.
Thank you again,

Vote YES on the partial Mass Ave (“MassAve4”) reconstruction proposal

Hello:
I recognize the current MassAve4 reconstruction proposal is a compromise position, and for this reason I am urging my
city council members to vote in favor of it at the next council meeting. The time this proposal buys MUST be used
constructively to find ways to help the small businesses along Mass Ave, in neighborhoods close to where I live and
where I like to shop. In this time of climate urgency, we cannot do one thing to help people to bike in Cambridge while
at the same time emptying Mass Ave of shops where I like to purchase things instead of having them delivered by
Amazon or some other delivery source that is leading to growth in carbon emissions when we should be cutting
emissions if we want to meet our own city's climate goals.
Thanks for your kind attention,

Re: The Plan to Remove All Parking in Porter Square

Dear Ms. Nolan,
Thank you for your response. I want to tell you a little more about one appointment my mother had.
As I mentioned below, she uses a walker and I accompany her to all medical appointments. At this appointment, I had
to park the car in the bicycle/bus lane in front of the doctor’s office, I put my hazard lights on and let her out of the
car. There was snow on the ground and we had to walk in the street in order to get up on the sidewalk. I then had to
leave her and go find a spot to park. I could only park across the street and had to go around a couple of times in order
to find a spot. I’m sure I wasted gas and contributed to the pollution in doing so. After I found a spot, I then had to
cross Mass. Ave. to attend to my mother.
There was no consideration to either my mother’s needs or mine as I was in as much danger as a bicyclist in crossing
Mass. Ave. Great strides have been made in our country to help the handicapped and elderly feel they are part of
society. Taking away parking spaces that people might need for the sake of a few bicyclists is outrageous in my
opinion. My mother cannot use a bicycle or take public transportation.
My mother lives independently and it is hard for her to have to ask for help; this situation makes it even worse for her.
Kind regards,
Maria

Dear Maria Mara,
Thank you for writing in about the plan for a network of bike lanes throughout Cambridge. As you may
know, the City Manager recently provided the Council with an update on the MassAve4 project, asking
for the Council’s approval on the approach and timeline. Per the report, the recommendation is to
implement separated bike lanes through partial construction for the segments of Mass Ave with the
overhead MBTA bus wires and the media, and full construction for the Harvard Square bus stops. With
this recommended approach, the median and overhead wires will be removed, which means 40 to 50%
of parking will be retained on this segment of Mass Ave. This reduction will be challenging, but
workable, and the city has committed to working with residents and businesses during the year planning
process.
I am very supportive of a network of protected of protected bike lanes throughout the City, and am
particularly grateful for all the work that Mass Ave for All has done to include community input. In terms
of this particular plan, I will be voting in favor, in part because of the increased timeline. The extra year

I noted at last night’s meeting that currently only 8% of Cambridge residents, and just 5% of Cambridge
workers commute to work by bicycle, which needs to increase if we are to reach our goals of fewer
transportation emissions. About half of Cambridge residents use a bicycle 1 or 2 times a month, which
alone is not enough in my opinion to justify spending $55 million on just this phase of the expansion of
bike lanes. If we are to realize the vision of a city with much reduced emissions, we need to consciously
work to reduce car use. I believe we should set specific goals around those metrics – That means
increasing bicycle use, public transit use, and walking. Part of this planning has to include a plan to
ensure that the bike lanes are used by more people, and that fewer people use their car in Cambridge; if
we don’t decrease car usage, we have failed.
And we must work to understand and meet the needs of residents who rely on cars now, as well as
small businesses whose customers rely on cars. I believe we can do it, with more time and a focused
attention on a truly inclusive process. I know that change will be difficult, as we move away from a carcentered city. I know there will be adverse consequences for some. We need to work to minimize the
adverse consequences even as we hold onto the goal of a city less reliant on and less catering to cars.
Thank you for taking the time to write in, and please let me know if you have any questions.

It is very sad to see the lovely city of Cambridge take away the privilege of residents and
visitors to park a car in this area. I bring my 94 year-old mother who uses a walker to
many medical appointments in the area and it truly breaks my heart to see the city ignoring
the needs of the handicapped and elderly for the sake of people that are able to ride a bike.
Does Cambridge now only listen to those that are healthy and young? A few days ago I
drove from Route 16 to Porter Square around 11:00 AM and I must have been in traffic
with at least 50-100 cars and I never saw a bicyclist in the 30 minutes I was on the Mass.

Cambridge Residents Alliance supports ARPA funding for HEART

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance regarding how to use the city’s ARPA funding.
We are in strong support of the application by Cambridge HEART for $5.5 million in ARPA funds to cover two years of
operating costs. This much needed alternative public safety program is already moving forward, but is limited by access
to funds. Funding HEART now would help it become operational much sooner, which would benefit the whole
city. HEART was designed and led by low-income people of color to provide an alternative public safety program for
their community, a community that has been most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses evidence-based
public safety models and is backed by Cambridge’s service providers and neighborhood activists.
We are very concerned about the current process for allocating ARPA funds. We would like the public to have input into
the decision process, as well as understanding of the process. We would like residents to have enough time to submit
applications and for there to be a clear timeline for submitting applications. There should be broad public
outreach. Nearby cities like Somerville, Chelsea, and Medford have had open, inclusive public processes for ARPA
funding.
We ask that the city revise its process so that ARPA funding allocation occurs in a transparent and participatory
manner. I hope the manager and councilors will discuss creating such a process at today's Finance hearing.
Thanks,

The removal of Mass Ave parking will make it impossible for me to access MY community, the local businesses and
health care services. Additionally, the current plan will force commercial trucks and other vehicular traffic onto abutting
residential streets thereby making these streets less safe for EVERYONE - particularly children & the elderly. Safety for all
- not just safety for bikers - should be the ultimate goal of this/any city project. DO NOT ALLOW THIS PLAN TO PROCEED.
As elected members of the Cambridge City Council, an appointed OFFICIAL - I request that you intervene in this process
and stop it NOW, obtain input from and give due and thorough consideration to the concerns of ALL impacted
stakeholders, and work with ALL citizens of CAMBRIDGE to formulate a plan that is far, far more likely to benefit ALL the
citizens of CAMBRIDGE and result in safety for all while maintaining the charm, look, and feel of North Cambridge & the
Porter Square neighborhoods.
The Quick Build plan you allowed on Mass Ave North of Central Square, removing metered and HP parking has made it
impossible for me to continue being a working and productive citizen!
I will work diligently to prevent your re-election/re-appointment if you do not act affirmatively to STOP this ill advised
and ridiculous plan which caters to a VERY VERY small number of highly vocal bikers, the majority of whom are NOT your
constituents. It is and immensely ill conceived, expensive and rushed plan that lacks the transparency and CAMBRIDGE
citizen input that you should be hearing and working to accomplish!

Removal of Parking Along Mass Ave

Dear Cambridge City Council:
As a former Cambridge resident and continued supporter of the many unique, local businesses in Cambridge, I
do not support a plan that will remove all metered parking along much of Mass Ave. where these unique
businesses are. As a senior citizen, I drive to reach these businesses and count on being able to park near
them. If nearby parking isn't available, I cannot continue dropping in to see what these wonderful stores
offer. What a shame it would be to lose stores that make Mass Ave. the delightful experience it is and
contribute to making Cambridge a special place. Many changes have already been made that increase the
safety of bicycle riders. Please do not focus solely on the their needs. Your local businesses are a treasure to
the residents and others like myself who value them. A design needs to be found that allows for safe streets
and also supports Cambridge residents, businesses, elderly, disabled, and visitors. If the requirements and
deadlines of the Cycling Safely Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets these goals, the ordinance
needs to be changed.
Sincerely,

MassAve4

As an abutter (I live in Porter Square on the Somerville side) and husband of a business owner in Cambridge I oppose the
city's proposal re building bike lanes along Mass Ave. I do so as a religious cyclist, who bikes daily from Porter Square
through Harvard Square and across the river into Allston and frequently north to Arlington and beyond on my leisure
bike rides.
I believe the bike lanes as proposed will do much more harm than good. I will point out just a few important
shortcomings:
1. Separated (and worse if raised) bike lanes tend to be too narrow to pass. If the city is successful in mode shifting to
cycling, then in the future there will be more and more instances where bikers, who will travel at uneven speeds, will
need to pass each other. If there is not enough room, they will be forced into the car lanes (if that is possible). If not
possible, they will be tempted to not even use the bike lanes. Both will be very dangerous. For an example, see the
protected bike lanes across the Longfellow Bridge and how dangerous weaving in and out of the car lanes to pass
already is.
2. Physically separated bike lanes will likely be even less well maintained than current Cambridge streets. This concern is
both related to the quality of the road surface and "maintenance" such as snow plowing and salt use in the winter. I
have on several occasions felt seriously in danger using the separated bike lane from Harvard to Porter Square over the
past two winters. While the main road was salted, the bike lane was a solid sheet of ice.
3. The physical separation creates death traps by forcing cars to block the bike lanes and obscuring the view of bike
lanes for turning cars. Exhibit 1 would be the implementation on Beacon Street at the Cambridge/Somerville line, which
I have mostly stopped using after experiencing both of these issues. Cars coming out of side streets will need to advance
far enough to see car traffic and that will often mean blocking the bike lanes. Similarly, parked cars will often obscure
the view of the bike lane for turning cars. With so many side streets, I am afraid biking on MAss Ave will become more,
not less dangerous.
4. The smorgas board (sp?) of applications confuses everybody and that also increases accident risk. At least the current
implementation of temporary bike lanes between Porter and Arlington has so many different configurations, with the
bike lane seemingly shifting in multiple (and often inexplicable) ways that nobody knows what to expect and cyclists
often just ignore the lane shifts. For bike lanes to be safe, they should be as linear as possible and, more importantly, be
consistent throughout.
5. Removing the median will make Mass Ave likely even uglier - I have wondered for the 30 years I have lived here why
there aren't trees planted in the median. Doing so would create more shading, improve air quality and improve the
overall look and feel of Mass Ave (assuming that the trees are actually taken care of). I think we need more green space
and the median would be an excellent opportunity for tree planting, and opportunity that will be lost with the proposed
solution.
I am totally in favor of changing the prioritization of transportation modes over time to align with climate goals. Making
biking safer and easier fits into that paradigm. But I feat that the proposed implementation will achieve the opposite. I
felt much safer with just a dotted line between the car lane and parking lane, perhaps even in a different color. For me,
making sure that my bike doesn't disappear in pot holes as I bike on Cambridge streets, enforcing speed limits for cars,
perhaps even adding more traffic calming measures that induce through traffic to NOT use Mass Ave, outlawing large
trucks, etc. would do more to make cycling safer than this proposal. Thanks for taking my view into account.
I would be happy to speak about these issues if helpful.
Kind wishes

Please do not add bike lanes

To whom it may concern,
My name is Jeremy and I live in Cambridge. I work as a real estate agent in Cambridge and Somerville exclusively and I'm
constantly driving through all the neighborhoods parking and stopping by local businesses on the way. Getting rid of the
parking on Mass Ave to replace it with bike Lanes would be absolutely disastrous not only for myself but for the
businesses and people of these neighborhoods.
I want to strongly urge you to look at the case study of Central Square.
They removed all the parking on one side of Mass Ave there to add bike Lanes. Go there yourself on any busy day. You
will see absolute chaos.
People pulled over in the bike lane to make deliveries pick things up or drop people off. It's an absolute disaster. It is
unsafe. It is unfair to the businesses and to the people. And at the end of the day it does not provide a safer situation for
bikers as they still have to navigate the street and figure out constant obstacles.
It adds congestion and overall is a bad look for the city. You'll notice that even in the short time they've been around
several markers have already been scratched up and knocked down.
Please look at the actual on the ground setting and make an informed decision here.
Removing parking to add on quick build bike Lanes is not going to fix anything. It will certainly make it worse!

Save Mass Ave

Dear City Council and City Manager,
I support SAFETY FOR ALL, but not at the expense of all other constituents and our neighborhoods.
Businesses cannot survive with a reduction of 50-60 percent of the current parking. Show the data you have that
shows this reduction is sustainable. You have not done the research to support this assumption. Just look at Northern
Mass Ave, and the area between Harvard Square and City Hall; you will see how the elimination of parking in these areas
has devastated their businesses and the life of those areas. This will change the very fabric of Cambridge and the
neighborhoods that we hold dear.
The changes that the City has been voting to approve as part of the Cycling Safety Ordinance will certainly put
neighborhood retail and service providers out of business or drive them from Cambridge in order to survive. If you
end the vibrancy of the mixed-use character of our Cambridge neighborhoods, which is a destination to many locally
and around the world, Cambridge will be forever changed.
What about the cost of the project? At the last City Council meeting the planners allocated in their "budget", $15M for
Harvard Square and $40M for just over 2 miles of partial build. City records also show that 3.19 miles of MassAve4 and
River Street Reconstruction has a construction budget of $80 million or $25 million/mile. And this does not include
"House Doctor" engineering support contracts. This will end up costing over a half billion dollars allocated to bike
lanes for 8% of the population, that many bikers have said don't make them really feel safer. Where does that leave the
budgets for all of the other pressing environmental and social issues facing the city?
If you are really concerned about safety of bikers, why doesn't the city require Bike helmets which are shown to save
lives. What about the safety of pedestrians and others who don't bike? Where the protected bikes lanes have been
installed on Northern Mass Ave, there have been several car crashes due to the confusion of the bus lanes, protected
bike lanes, confusing signage, and travel lanes.
If this is the direction that the city is going, shouldn't this be a decision of the residents of Cambridge, not just 8% of
the Community? Shouldn’t this not be a referendum item? The City Council is responsible to all the
residents? Shouldn't residents decide what they want for the future of their city?
This Cycling Safety Ordinance was passed in the darkest days of our existence, during COVID, without any
representation or feedback from the voters of Cambridge. You should be ashamed of yourselves for pushing this
through without even one city-wide mailing or public review for those who you represent, the voters.
Sincerely,
Jenny Payette

QuickBuild parking proposal -petition from mental health clinicians
Keep Mass Ave parking petitionApril 2022.docx

April 21, 2022
Dear City Manager, City Traffic Manager and City Council Members,
We, the undersigned, are psychologists, clinical social workers and psychiatrists, treating
children, adolescents, adults and senior citizens in our offices in the area between Shepherd
Street and Porter Square. As you may well be aware, there is a severe mental health crisis in
our community. The demand for mental health services has skyrocketed in the last few years
and we provide essential care to those from Cambridge and local environs.
Our patients arrive at our offices predominantly by car, although some are able to come by
public transport and, especially when the weather is good, some are able to come by bicycle.
For most of them, and most of the time, the availability of on-site parking - for at least an hour
- is vital. Removal of half of the parking meters near our offices will make it much more
difficult for most of our patients to access our mental health services.
The City's proposed removal of this parking - without any consultation with any of us - will be
enormously disruptive to us and to our patients. It may well force us to relocate our practices
to other towns. This will result in a significant loss of mental health care in Cambridge, already
experiencing a scarcity of mental health treatment.
We concur with the desire for safer travel for all – bicyclists, public transportation,
pedestrians, and cars. We respectfully request that the City Council conduct clear impact
studies and provide our community with a transparent project plan to create equitable options
that do not destroy the health care and business vitality of the area. Please open avenues for
community involvement to find traffic solutions that do not disproportionally impact and
disrupt the established mental health care in this area.
Thank you,

Support the MassAve4 Reconstruction Proposal

Hello,
I would like to express my support for the proposed plan and timeline contained within the Partial Mass Ave
Reconstruction Proposal submitted to the city on 4/7/22.
Currently I use cycling and public transit as my only forms of transportation around Cambridge. However, I will
actively choose to avoid biking on portions of Mass Ave because I do not feel it is safe to do so in its current state. The
improvements proposed in the plan would help to make these stretches of road safer and would enable me, and many
others, to feel safe enough to bike down these stretches of Mass Ave.
While the concerns of business owners ought to be heard and understood, I want to point out that if I had the ability to
feel safe biking on Mass Ave, I would be more likely to stop and shop at businesses located on it. Drivers are not the only
people who shop, pedestrians and cyclists do as well. Therefore, by enabling safe bike and pedestrian movement along
Mass Ave we are also enabling all of those cyclists and pedestrians to patronize local businesses.
Safe and protected bike infrastructure is critical to the future of Cambridge. I want to once again urge you to vote yes on
the proposed plan and timeline contained within the Partial Mass Ave Reconstruction Proposal.
Thank you,
Jack Heavner

Written Comment for the Finance Committee Public Hearing Concerning ARPA Funding
Initiatives:

Peace Be Unto You,
Dear City Clerk, please forward the following written Comment on to the Finance Committee's Public Hearing
on April 20, 2022., to be entered into the official record. Thank you.
Yours In Peace
Hasson Rashid
Written Comment for the Finance Committee Public Hearing Concerning ARPA Funding Initiatives:
Peace Be Unto You,
Dear Finance Committee, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is an unprecedented effort, and the resources
provided can enable communities to make significant strides to end homelessness. A historic amount of
federal funding is available locally to end homelessness and housing instability. The American Rescue Plan
Act (ARPA) offers Cambridge, MA a once-in-a-generation opportunity to drastically reduce homelessness in the
community. Preference should be given to projects that provide transitional and permanent housing for
homeless individuals and families. COVID-19 locally pushed people to the brink of homelessness and beyond. It also
helped expose many of the systemic issues that prevent people from escaping homelessness, and the city of Cambridge
to reconsider how they should respond to the crisis.
People in Cambridge sleep on the streets every night. There is also a shortage of affordable rental homes for the lowestincome households. The gap of affordable rental units could grow in the city of Cambridge, MA without significant
housing investments. Cambridge must solve its housing crisis. ARPA funds should be prioritized and Allocated from
the American Rescue Plan to bolster Cambridge's homeless response systems, focus on permanent housing and
prioritize those most vulnerable. These investments are both necessary and overdue. With rents rising, homelessness
increasing, public housing deteriorating, and millions of families struggling to keep a roof over their heads, ARPA
investments are badly needed and long overdue, with significant grant funding that can be spent on human services,
housing, general infrastructure, and more. Use ARPA funding to address several levels of housing instability, allocated to
homeless service providers, services for victims of domestic abuse, and also allocated to those experiencing
homelessness. Reduce homelessness, Help as many high-need people as possible, Reduce racial
disproportionality and disparities.
And given the disproportionately of people of color among those who experience homelessness, these
economic impacts should be at the forefront of homelessness systems’ minds when planning how to spend
federal ARPA funds,etc.,. Within this decision-making process is the ability to examine data through a racial
equity lens and ask strategic questions about where the greatest disparities lie and how ARPA funding might
impact them. A start can be had by identifying specific homeless groups or subgroups who are experiencing
homelessness for longer periods of time or have higher rates of unsheltered homelessness. Additionally, they
can undergo another level of analysis by examining racial disparities among these groups or subgroups. ARPA
funding can then be prioritized to identified groups and subgroups, who not only experience homelessness for
longer periods of time or have higher rates of unsheltered homelessness, but that also have high rates of racial

disparities. One critical component of Housing First is creating necessary community connections to facilitate
housing stability. Strategically done, this effort can be integrated with a community’s racial equity priorities.
ARPA funds can best be used to reduce homelessness. The opportunity to quickly reduce the number of
people who are homeless is unprecedented. We cannot overstate how important it will be to spend
these funds on measures that will lead to significant reductions in homelessness. Keeping people housed is the
first step to ending homelessness once and for all.The pandemic proved that we need to rethink housing in the U.S. It
also showed that aid programs work when providing agencies and service organizations with sufficient funds and clear
guidance on spending aid dollars.
Finally,assure equity in delivering ARPA funding programs. In doing so please keep within the guidelines offered in
President Joe Biden's Executive Order 13985, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness
(USICH) Equity Action Plan, guidance from the National Low Income Housing Coalition's (NLIHC) on funding
poverty housing and homeless, the National Alliance to End homelessness (NAEH) guides on funding efforts to
end homelessness, local government recommendation to end homelessness and closing the affordable
housing gap here in Cambridge,MA..

Written Comment on The Climate Crisis Working Group Findings and Recommendation
(Please add Item to Upcoming City Council Agenda)

Written Comment onThe Climate Crisis Working Group Findings Recommendation
Peace Be Unto You;
Dear Cambridge,
My written comment is a brief critique of a few items in the recently released Climate Crisis Working Group Findings
and. Recommendations. The specific item that I offer a reaction to is found in Appendix A. on pg. 31, entitled “Anything
We Missed.” This item is found at the very end of the document. It pertains to what if anything was missing from the
Findings and Recommendations. I think that precise emphasis and coverage of those most affected by the climate crisis
was missing, such as the plight of the homeless and their struggles against the natural elements. The need for homeless
housing as a relief from the climate was missing. For the homeless, housing is a relief from the climate crisis and its
change. The need to prioritize the people most impacted by the climate criis was not covered at all. The working group
missed this in total.
The working group seems to concentrate on everything environmental except those affected the most by the climate
crisis and climate change, and they are the homeless, in which a disproportionate number are black men, women, and
children. Climate crisis and climate change, and racial injustice share the same roots, and have to be addressed together,
and that was also missing in the working group’s findings and recommendation. There is no climate action that is not
also about racial equity, diversity inclusion, and justice for the most vulnerable segments of the community.
There is a long history of racism in the mainstream environmental, built by people who cared about things like,
conservation, wild life, trees, open space, but didn’t care about poor black peoples, and other impoverished segments of
the community
We need to be able to prioritize the people that are going to be most impacted.
The findings and recommendations don't fortify support for underserved communities and don't support
equitable community development for all people. Mass layoffs and other economic disruptions in the wake of
the pandemic are drastically increasing the number of people at risk of homelessness. This is especially true in
Massachusetts, which was coping with a homelessness crisis and a severe housing shortage before COVID-19 became an
issue.
The working group missed reporting on and supporting planning efforts, policy changes and legislation that facilitate
higher density housing (especially affordable housing) near transit as an essential strategy for cities to meet climate
change goals by reducing building and transportation emissions.
The working group missed encouraging conversation around the connection between climate change
and racial equity. Though climate change will affect all people in Cambridge, many (homeless) are more
vulnerable to climate change. Climate change will have a greater negative effect on this group.
Finally, the importance of social equity in addressing the climate crisis and climate change, was totally
excluded in the working group’s released of its findings and recommendations.

Acknowledgment & Dedication
This report is dedicated to the hundreds of Cambridge residents who have
worked over the years to push Cambridge to address the climate crisis in a
meaningful way. From convening climate congresses and plenaries and seminars
to volunteering hundreds of hours engaging in thoughtful comprehensive
educational efforts to strong and forceful advocacy, these residents have
consistently worked to make the city a leader. Some people have been writing
and speaking for decades, others for far shorter. All share a passion for change,
a conviction that Cambridge must stand up and be a role model, and a deepseated and growing concern about the implication for our city (and the world)
of our lack of progress in reducing emissions and mitigating the impact of the
already changed and changing climate. The crisis is with us; it is accelerating.
The CCWG seeks to accelerate Cambridge’s effectiveness in climate action and
become a leader in impact, not only intent. The CCWG honors all the work that
has been done and the people who demand greater urgency and bold action.

Introduction
The Climate Crisis Working Group was
convened by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui
with Councillor Patty Nolan to build on
the city’s work on climate. The main
goal of the group is to increase the
urgency of our climate actions and
the impact of that work by providing
guidance on how Cambridge can better
address the climate crisis. The need for
greater urgency was made exceedingly
clear by the recent Net Zero Action
Plan 5-year Impact Evaluation Report,
released in December of 2020, which
concluded that the City will have to
accelerate emissions reductions
twentyfold over the next ten years in
order to meet our goals. That sobering
assessment means immediate action
is needed. Despite more than twenty
years of climate efforts, with multiple
worthy initiatives, citywide greenhouse
gas emissions have remained relatively
unchanged since 2003. Though
some of this can be accounted for in
Cambridge’s growth, other entities
with similar expansion have had some
success in reducing emissions. It was
time to take stock and see if a group
of relative outsiders - most of whom
had not been directly involved in city
climate efforts - could come up with
some useful ideas.

2

Our goal was to provide input and
guidance to the City Council and the
administration by reviewing climate
work within the city, building on existing
efforts, consulting with community

advocates, and soliciting input from the
group members. The working group
sought to identify ways to accelerate
progress and develop a list of targeted
actions for the City to implement. From
the beginning, the goal was to make
sure the output of the group was not
a report to put on a shelf, but a guide
for a new approach to climate work.
The city has enough reports and lists
of actions to take. We need a culture
shift, and financial investment to match
the need. We see the value added of
the CCWG to the stellar climate work
done over the last two decades is our
willingness to call out and identify
lapses in program implementation,
effectiveness and the general lack
of progress. In response a key
recommendation is to propose a
culture shift.
The CCWG met six times during the
fall of 2021, all remotely due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Find short
meeting summaries below, with
full meeting slides available in the
appendix.
Meeting 1 - September 1, 2021
The first meeting started with a
welcome message and an introduction
of the members. Meeting discussion
covered: an overview of the CCWG’s
goals, a quick review of the City’s
previous climate actions, successes,
and failures, and a discussion of future
meetings and next steps.

Packet Pg. 315

Meeting 2 - September 15, 2021
The meeting began with a review of the
CCWG work plan and discussion of any
necessary edits. Then, the rest of the
meeting was devoted to identifying key
actors in Cambridge’s climate goals,
actions they may take, and discussion
ended up centered on the concept
of focusing on potential barriers to
carrying out climate actions.
Meeting 3 - October 13, 2021
During this meeting, the CCWG
reviewed the City’s past and current
climate actions, focusing on where they
succeeded or failed to meet the goals.
The CCWG then reviewed why certain
initiatives succeeded or failed, which
barriers they faced, and brainstormed
ideas to overcome these barriers.
Meeting 4 - October 27, 2021
At this meeting, the discussion started
with a review of the recently released
Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Report,
then summarized the CCWG’s top
ideas to date. The group discussed and
narrowed down feasible goals to 3-5
ideas, then broke into smaller groups to
create action plans for these ideas.
Meeting 5 - November 17, 2021
At the beginning of this meeting,
the Group reviewed the goals that had
been established at Meeting 4, then
reviewed the Building Energy Use and
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) draft
amendments (with presentations by
city staff and CCWG members) and
discussed reactions. The meeting
3

concluded with compiling a list of
smaller, simpler action items to
complement the main goals.
Meeting 6 - November 30, 2021
The last meeting was largely
devoted to discussing and refining
some recommendations with
acknowledgement that the work was
not done, but that the conceptual
framework of barriers and focus on
ensuring impact was helpful. There was
some discussion of the final product
and next steps.

Cambridge Climate History & Next Steps
Cambridge declared a climate
emergency over a decade ago and
has been actively working to address
the climate crisis for more than
twenty years. The city has taken
some important steps, yet is behind
on overall climate goals and has
consistently missed the mark on both
citywide goals and deadlines. CCWG
group members, all of whom have a
strong awareness and understanding
of the climate crisis, believe Cambridge
can and should be a leader on climate
action and climate justice. And the city
is not living up to its potential.

5

Over the course of six meetings,
the CCWG covered a lot of ground
and wrestled with the question of
how to make the extensive climate
work in the city more effective. The
starting point and inspiration for
the CCWG was a sense that the city
is underperforming in terms of its
climate goals, but has the potential to
be a climate leader. Reviewing the data
on citywide climate goals, projects,
and plans leads to the conclusion that
despite a lot of good work, Cambridge
is not doing enough and is not working
effectively or smartly. To date, the city’s
impact on the reduction of citywide
emissions has not been sufficient;
therefore, a critical review of the overall
body of work is warranted, with an
attempt to understand the necessary
change for greater effectiveness. Our
goal was to review the major areas

for potential impact, seek to affect
the sense of urgency, and produce
recommendations for the City.
During the course of our work, three
questions guided our thinking: What
are the city’s greatest successes and
what facilitated them? Where is there
a lack of progress or unmet goals
and how can our understanding of
certain barriers help re-shape the city’s
actions, policies, priorities, and culture?
What can the city do to make more
progress?
The CCWG was formed and members
agreed to serve because of a shared
belief that the city’s efforts have
not been effective enough. The city
administration has many sound plans
and has committed substantial talent
and resources to them. However, we
are still falling behind our targets and
failing to reach our goals. Our central
question asks why, and is there some
way to address that shortcoming - or
is it inevitable given the scope and
scale of the challenge? In some areas
Cambridge has been a leader and used
as a model by other cities and towns. In
other areas other cities and towns are
ahead of Cambridge and can serve as
a model for our future actions.
The consensus of the group is that
in order to make progress - and for
the CCWG to deliver on the promise
of positive impactful disruption - it is

critical to avoid the trap of collecting
ideas and creating yet another plan
that, although solidly full of good
ideas and intentions, still does not
move the needle. Cambridge has
many reports and plans related to
climate action including many with
specific action steps and deadlines.
Based on our discussions and work,
the recommendations come at
two levels. First, an overarching
primary recommendation is to
address barriers to success. These
barriers are: the cultural mindset
around climate, lack of funding, an
aversion to mandates, and structural
challenges. The second level of
recommendations are specific
recommendations for actions to take,
many of which are already underway
in the city.
The seven identified recommended
action areas build on existing work
and urge more decisive action, with
accelerated timelines. To sum up the
approach that needs to be taken:
Cambridge - all parts of the city and the
community - needs to act as though
the climate crisis is the emergency
the city declared a decade ago. The
COVID-19 response showed that
rapid change can happen when facing
an emergency, and the city’s recent
response to the affordable housing
situation also provides a model:
direct funding for affordable housing
doubled to over $30 million in the last
two years and almost tripled over the
last decade. It is in keeping with these
6

models of how to act in the face of
an emergency that we present these
recommendations to the City Council.
Without addressing the barriers that
have stymied effective action, progress
will continue to be slower than what
is possible and desired. That means
working to change a mindset that has
contributed to slower progress than is
possible and desired, use mandates
- along with stronger incentives - to
achieve results, and fund climate
efforts commensurate with the need.
The recommended actions to be
taken are feasible, although some
will engender pushback (especially in
terms of timelines and breadth). The
City - both the City Council and the
administration - will have to stand firm if
Cambridge’s climate leadership is to be
asserted.

Identifying & Addressing Barriers to Success
The original goal of the CCWG was to
be bold and disruptive in coming up
with an action plan which could lead to
impact on the city’s multifaceted and
deep work on climate issues. It was
clear from the first meeting that many
climate actions and steps were already
underway, being discussed, studied,
proposed and/or prioritized by several
groups. For the last twenty years. So
why hasn’t there been more progress?
Of course there are many reasons
that are real: the issue is daunting, the
challenge great and moving the needle
on reducing emissions and changing
the trajectory of climate disaster is
monumentally difficult. However, there
are signals and some evidence that
more progress could have been made
- based on the experience of some
players, notably the city itself in its
operations and two major institutions in
the city - Harvard and MIT. All three of
those entities have reduced emissions
and made more progress towards
meeting climate goals than the city as
a whole.

7

There is something the CCWG
identified that could help: our
value added from our work is a
recommendation to put as much focus
on WHY things haven’t panned out - as
on identifying and prioritizing actions
to take. That approach of directly
addressing the roadblocks and barriers
- in order to understand and remove,
not to dwell on them - has not been

as central to climate work as we think
it should be. The CCWG kept coming
up against the need to identify and
directly address barriers if the city is
to successfully meet the climate crisis
challenge. There are structural barriers
that limit ability to make changes many of which can only be resolved
at the state or even federal level. The
CCWG acknowledges those and
encourages the City administration
and City Council to push for changes
whenever possible to address the
structural barriers at those levels. In
addition to recognizing the importance
of addressing structural barriers, the
CCWG identified three other sets
of barriers that collectively inhibit
effective climate action.
At the heart of the discussions were
two themes: Cambridge needs tangible
results with a focus on environmental
justice, since the climate crisis in all its
manifestations most adversely impacts
vulnerable populations. And a key to
success over the next few years is to
consciously and intentionally address
the barriers the City can affect directly:
Mindset, Mandates and Money.

Mindset: A culture change is needed.
◊ The acknowledgement of failures is as important as the celebration of
successes.
• Too often, failure to meet goals is not acknowledged, leading to
continuation of a status quo which hasn’t worked.
• Not communicating lapses leads people to not knowing that change
is needed and thus less urgency to adjust actions.
◊ Accountability and oversight are needed. And full transparency.
• Timelines - the City must create a mechanism to monitor deadlines
since climate deadlines have been consistently missed. Adjusting
goals is sometimes necessary, yet deadlines should not be ignored.
And when a goalpost is adjusted, it should be public, which builds
trust.
• Implementation - there should be a way to measure if
implementation occurred as planned, so we can celebrate the
climate successes and adjust when off course.
• Results/outcomes measuring - there should be a centralized system
to monitor and measure results of climate initiatives in more depth
than the Sustainability Dashboard, which has few goals and outdated
results. Limitations in data access and measuring outcomes should
be fixed. Responsibility for results must be clear. Outcomes must
be consistently reviewed and updated.
• Openness - A lack of transparency has hindered progress and
participation.
◊ Inclusive open process of gathering and using input from all stakeholders
must become standard - required.
• The Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) has been
underutilized, left out of key discussions and has no authority to
effectively oversee the areas it is charged with overseeing.
• Engage and use community experts - respecting, listening to, and
following advice from a larger group will improve outcomes.
• The authority of certain groups, like the Net Zero Action Plan Task
Force (NZAPTF), activists, and residents should be better defined
◊ Evaluation of program design and effectiveness needs to be clear, timely,
open and honest. Many programs have been started and time spent on
climate initiatives which then fade away with not even a report that can
inform future work [Example: the Georgetown Climate Prize effort.]

Mandates: Carrots need to be bigger and more flavorful AND used with sticks
to get the desired results.
◊ BEUDO is a prime example of how there was not much incentive to
change behavior, or direct support in the form of funding or recognition.
And exposure of emissions wasn’t sufficient - and climate leaders were
not recognized. Now requirements are needed and should be enforced
through rules and regulations along with strong incentives. Effort went
into the collection of data and time spent by the city and property owners
to report, with BEUDO itself having little impact on reducing emissions those property owners working on reduction were already engaged. [See
below for update to BEUDO.]
◊ Examples of necessary mandates include:
• Transition point electrification: This could be a game-changer and
should be developed as soon as possible.
• EV use and charging, bicycle, and public transit infrastructure should
be required more widely.
Money: Investment needs to match the challenge.
◊ Major investmentment is needed to make the city an environmental
leader
◊ Ideas with potential for meaningful impact:
• Fund and leverage Eversource programs to create a GeoGrid
demonstration in Cambridge. Cambridge should explore how to
be a pilot site by partnering with Eversource or outside funders.
Perhaps use a third-party installer who funds the project and
owns the infrastructure. HEET is hosting a meeting with interested
municipalities in April or May to allow them to consider both options.
Invest in a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA, as MIT did in
2016).
• Use PACE or another mechanism to enable financing for heat pumps
and/or solar panels for residents, especially low income residents. If
city funding mechanisms cannot be used, pursuing outside funding
should be a priority.
• Invest in EV, bicycle, and public transit infrastructure and incentives
across city operations and for all residents, visitors and employees.

Recommendations
Below are seven recommendations which are appropriate areas of focus
for and action by the city in the near
term. These actions are mostly items
drawn from the work of other city
climate groups, notably CPAC and the
offshoots of NZAP and CRZTF and
Mothers Out Front, Green Cambridge
and 350MA Cambridge. Some actions
were identified through the CCWG
and have not been part of the CPAC
work - although the city has worked on
some items outside of CPAC and other
climate groups. There are many other
ideas, actions, and initiatives identified
by CCWG members as worthy of effort
and pursuing which could be included
in future climate work. The CCWG could
not cover them all in the short amount
of time. There may be some possibility
for group members to continue the
work in some form. It is important to
note, though, without the changes
in mindset, mandates and money
summarized above, these actions are
not likely to yield the desired impact.
1. BEUDO Amendments Performance
Requirements: strengthen,
implement:
In the City of Cambridge, energy use
in buildings accounts for the majority

10

of greenhouse gas emissions -- about
80%, compared to most cities where
buildings represent about half of
emissions and less than half nationally
and globally. In response to growing
concerns about energy use and climate
change, the Building Energy Use
Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
enacted by the Cambridge City Council
on July 28, 2014. This ordinance
requires owners of larger buildings to
monitor and report annual building
energy use to the City. This data is then
categorized and made available on the
Cambridge Open Portal. The intention
of this ordinance was to make energy
and water use data publicly available,
so that various users such as potential
property buyers, tenants, realtors, and
others can make informed decisions,
hopefully incentivizing building owners
to reduce energy usage in their building
stock. However, it is now clear that
energy use disclosure is not enough,
and ordinance amendments1 to
introduce performance requirements
are currently under consideration by
the City Council as contemplated in the
original ordinance.
The proposed ordinance amendments
require not only disclosure of building
energy use, but establish a schedule

Packet Pg. 323

for reductions in GHG emissions.
As written the CCWG believes the
draft recommendations fall short
of the actions necessary to meet
the challenges of the climate crisis.
Currently, the amendments require
each BEUDO property to comply
with Greenhouse Gas Emissions
requirements over a course of 6
compliance periods, resulting in net
zero emissions in 2050. The CCWG
recommends that this timeline be
accelerated, with net zero reached
by 2040 at the latest. And that all
new buildings within the scope of
BEUDO be required to be net zero
immediately. This goal is in line with a
policy order passed by the City Council
in 2017, calling for 100% clean and
renewable energy in the building and
transportation sectors by 2035.
Additionally, the amendments should
be changed to add a requirement that
outliers which use significantly more
energy than other buildings must
reach a certain baseline within the
first few years. In other words, there
should be a threshold that all BEUDO
covered buildings must meet by 2025,
then start their emissions reductions
plans from there. This would ensure
that buildings which already meet
the threshold are not exempt from
reducing emissions -- they will still stick
to the emissions requirements under
the compliance period schedule -- but

11

large emitters will need to catch up to
them.
RECOMMENDATION: Amend BEUDO
along the lines of the city proposal,
with stronger elements: Shorten
the timeline for net zero, ensure
the highest alternative payment is
required, bring outliers’ emissions
down faster.

2. CCE Changes: higher RPS for
the standard offering, including
community shared solar:
The Cambridge Community Electricity
Program (CCE) is an electricity
aggregation program authorized under
MGL XXII, Ch. 164, §164 that opts-in
residents to electricity supply selected
by the City via City procurement
process. CCE provides consumers
with two options:, Standard Green
and 100% Green Plus. Residents
and businesses on Basic Rate are
automatically enrolled in Standard
Green, which meets the minimum
Massachusetts renewable energy
requirements, including 20% from
“premium” renewable energy sources
in New England (MA Class I RECs).
In contrast, 100% Green Plus offers
100% of electricity from “premium”
renewable energy sources in New
England (MA Class I RECs), while also
purchasing MA Class I RECs to achieve
100% renewable energy. Customers
can also choose not to participate in
the CCE program and opt down to
Eversource basic service or dozens of
other suppliers.
Cambridge CCE participation rates
show that most people stay in the
default program option - Standard
Green. Very few people opt out of the
supply selected under CCE by the City.
One issue is that for all new accounts,
it takes a while for the account to be
part of CCE. Only about 5% opt up to
100% Green Plus. Given inertia and the
fact that it takes action, no matter how
12

easy, that low percent is not surprising.
However, since Cambridge perceives
itself as a climate leader and enormous
effort went into trying to get people to
opt into 100% Green Plus, this program
is an example of a communication and
action strategy that did not achieve the
desired result. The communications
efforts on this have yet to be evaluated
and assessed, which might help guide
future efforts in other areas.
Other cities and towns have different
program offerings; conversations
with representatives from the cities
of Somerville, Natick, Newton and
Boston have documented that
most customers stay in the default
option, while a small number opt up
or down. The difference, though, is
that Cambridge’s default option has a
low percentage of renewable energy
compared to other municipalities (see
Fig. 1, Fig. 2 in Appendix B). The city
touts that the number opting in to
100% renewable option has doubled,
but with only 5% participating, the
city’s use is not significant enough to
be making as much difference as other
municipalities with a much higher RPS.
Cambridge’s current standard offering
is the minimum percent renewable
energy required by law. While there
is an addition of 0.2¢ (2/10 of a cent)
that goes to onsite renewable energy
in Cambridge, this adder generates
relatively little funds - about $650K/
year. RECs in New England are
priced at the point where they make a
difference to the greening of the grid -

which is the point of RECs. Collectively
the community aggregation programs
in municipalities across Massachusetts
are affecting the addition of renewables
onto the grid. Cambridge can and
should do more to contribute to that
effort. In fact, Cambridge’s first CCE
plan was described as greenwashing
in a report published by the Green
Energy Consumer Alliance review
in 2020 of community electric
aggregation in Mass[ page 19]:
The CCWG recommends that the
CCE program amend the default
program option and follow the lead
of other cities and have three tiers. A
standard offering (“Standard Green”)
which is the default with a much
higher RPS than the minimum, a
basic offering meeting the minimum
Massachusetts renewable requirement,
and a 100% renewable offering. The
Standard Green should at least match
surrounding municipalities. Standard
(default) offers for other cities as of
summer of 2021 are as follows:
●
Lexington - 100% renewable
●
Newton - 80% renewable
●
Watertown - 53% renewable
●
Worcester - 38% renewable
●
Natick - 31% renewable
●
Boston - 28% renewable
●
Somerville - 28% renewable
●
Cambridge - 18% renewable =
state minimum required
In addition to being able to opt-in
residents to City-selected electricity
supply, state rules governing CCE
13

also allow the City to opt-in residents
to Community Shared Solar (CSS)
under the Solar Massachusetts
Renewable Target (“SMART”) program.
The CSS program delivers electricity
to the grid from solar farms across
Massachusetts creating new sources
of clean electricity and supporting
development of the solar industry
in Massachusetts. CSS reduces
electricity costs and the SMART
program makes additional savings
available to low income households.
LICSS is currently operating and details
are being worked out with DPU on
including in aggregation programs. It
is expected that soon the City can
opt-in low income households without
any outlays on the part of the City
or residents, no use of space within
the City, no use of City land, and no
installation on the property of the
City or its residents. City of Boston
is working with DOER and DPU to
use its CCE program to enroll 20,000
low income households in Boston in
CSS. CCWG recommends that City
of Cambridge join with City of Boston
working with DOER and DPU to take
advantage of this opportunity provided
to municipalities under state law (M.G.L
Title XXII Ch. 164 §134).
RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) For
Cambridge to be a climate leader,
we must offer a higher percentage
of MA Class I RECs in our Standard
Green option. The CDD should either
increase the default (standard) RPS to
80% renewable or copy Lexington’s

model of a standard offer at 100%
renewables not in New England
which is very close to Cambridge’s
18% renewable price, and an opt-up
option of 100% Renewables in New
England. 2) Follow Boston’s example
by using CCE to opt-in low income
households to develop new clean
energy sources and simultaneously
reduce energy burden for low income
households without outlay on the
part of the City.

3. Solar: City should invest in a VPPA,
expand community solar:
The Cambridge Community
Development Department is currently
exploring the possibility of signing a
Virtual Power Purchase Agreement
(VPPA) as a way to off-set the city’s
emissions. With a VPPA, Cambridge
would invest in a distant, off-side
solar installation that reduces carbon
emissions by displacing dirty energy
in the host region, and may result in a
positive economic return to its owners/
financers from the sale of electricity.
MIT and many other institutions have
done VPPAs - even if a VPPA is just one
step towards 100% renewable energy,
it is a proven way to move the needle
and contribute to a greener grid. The
CCWG enthusiastically supports this
idea.
The CCWG notes that on-site solar
generation for all city properties residential and commercial - is an
important way every resident can be
part of the solution. The CEA has been
working to make headway in getting
1-4 family homes to install solar, and
a report on the CEA’s effectiveness
is underway and could be valuable in
determining how to ramp up those
efforts. The installation of solar
is challenging, and those homes
collectively generate less 15% of
citywide emissions. However, with the
need for electrical capacity and the
inevitable huge increase in demand for
electricity, every possible clean-energy
addition to the grid, including small15

scale onsite solar should be pursued.
And, it is a solid way for those residents
to contribute to solutions. Cambridge
should support the development
of clean energy and reduce energy
burden on low income households
at no cost by enrolling low income
households in community solar. By
having all low income households be
automatically enrolled, all would benefit.
RECOMMENDATION: For City
properties, the CCWG recommends
that all City properties utilize on-site
solar power generation. Additionally,
City meters should be enrolled in
the Community Shared Solar (CSS)
available across the State since 2014
and now operated under the State’s’
SMART program - this would both
save money and increase energy
efficiency of municipal properties.
Additionally, the City should optin low income households to CSS
under CCE as described above...
This way, Cambridge would benefit
from facilities that have already been
built by private companies under the
State’s SMART program without any
investment or installation.

4. Transportation: incentivize nonauto transportation and EVs and
accelerate adoption:
Transportation is the second largest
source of emissions in Cambridge
and the largest source statewide.
In addition to emissions reduction,
reforming transportation in Cambridge
would reduce noise and air pollution
(which has a disproportionate impact
on low income neighborhoods),
congestion, and deaths and injuries

resulting from crashes. It is critical to
expand mobility options for all citizens
of Cambridge to promote alternatives
to private vehicles. While Cambridge
does not control every road within the
city limits and many commuters simply
travel through Cambridge, there are
concrete steps that can be taken in
the immediate term that would reduce
transportation emissions and make
Cambridge a safer, greener, healthier,
and more equitable City.

RECOMMENDATIONS: See below for a list of actions that were discussed by
transportation experts within the CCWG:
Transition to an all electric municipal fleet with an aggressive timeline.
◊ Strengthen and codify the current Green Fleet Policy in ordinance.
◊ As soon as an EV is available, all new purchases should be EV - with
an expected complete replacement for passenger vehicles and light
commercial vehicles by 20302; the city’s medium and heavy duty fleet
should transition by 2035. Ensure that all leased and owned school buses
are electric vehicles are EVs.
Electrification
◊ Create an aggressive plan for the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.
• Build off of other cities with EV goals, like Boston.
◊ Utilize all existing options - light pole charging, public lot chargers, right to
charge, allow private residences to lease their chargers to the public.
◊ 100 more publicly available EV chargers should be installed in the next 5
years and goal established for next 5 years
• Create a comprehensive plan with community input.
• Require consideration of equity in terms of the placement of
chargers.
Reduce vehicle traffic and expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure to
ensure safe cycling and walking for citizens.
◊ Bike parking infrastructure that provides bikes protection from elements

enables more residents to own bikes.
• Public bike parking should be installed in residential neighborhoods.
• Explore options like secure bike parking pods.
◊ Provide options including rebates and funding to make bikes, e-bikes,
and bike shares more affordable to low income residents
• Include concrete initiatives for expansion of e-bike use
• Review bike-share use and expand access and establish targets to
serve all residents with station proximity
◊ Bus and bike lane infrastructure - work with city and MBTA to expand past
efforts and provide a fare free transit pilot by the summer of 2022.
Engaging all stakeholders, explore vehicle free and low and zero emission
zones to reduce emissions and inequity in air quality; make this a priority in
working with the state to move forward and seek funding to implement
◊ Example3: delivery and curb management. Heavy duty vehicle Deliveries
increases air pollution, traffic, safety risks, and idling, - consider if there are
emission free ways to deliver, like the utilization of cargo bikes, increase
anti-idling efforts
Fare free transit: support city efforts to expand on pilot and work with state
to extend to more public transit, including microtransit, and enhancing
pedestrian and cycling opportunities connecting with transit.
End parking minimums and encourage parking maximums.
◊ End parking minimums and institute parking maximums to move
Cambridge towards a less car-oriented city.

5. GeoGrids: Cambridge should
actively pursue and install a
demonstration:
The transition to electrification is an
urgent need to meet climate goals.
Currently the only way to decarbonize
is to electrify and have renewable
electricity. With buildings the largest
contributor to GHG emissions, heating
and cooling buildings have been a
focus of efforts. The Cambridge-based
Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET),
led by co-executive directors Audrey
Schulman and Zeyneb Magavi, has
provided a potential way to accomplish
this goal. HEET proved its capability by
mapping thousands of dangerous gas
leaks across the state, highlighting that
the need to move away from natural
gas as quickly as possible is both a
matter of climate emergency as well as
public safety.
Networked ground source heat pumps
represent a viable path towards
transitioning away from natural
gas. HEET’s GeoGrid4 : a system of
networked ground source heat pumps,
structured like a gas system to provide
heat to an entire district, was reviewed
by the CCWG. The infrastructure is
installed in the street, with pipes going
into every building. The only emissions
come from electricity used, so any
building connected would immediately
reduce emissions and as the grid

18

was greener, get to net zero or zero
emissions. This type of system could
meet 100% of energy needs - in some
cases, even resulting in excess energy
the initial results of installations show
where it has been installed the system
is cleaner, cheaper in the long-term,
and healthier for residents.
The impact of implementing wide scale
GeoGridsis potentially monumental.
The CCWG asked Councillor Nolan and
the Mayor to push for Cambridge as
a pilot site for Eversource to install a
GeoGrid, and a policy order resulted.
RECOMMENDATION: Since
Cambridge was not selected for
the first Eversource demonstration
installation, the city should find a way
to do a pilot installation, either using
city funds for one or more sites in
Cambridge or having a third party
company install, own, and maintain
the system. A pilot site should be
chosen to maximize impact and
equity - the densest parts of the
city deserve the potential financial
savings and health benefits of
eliminating gas with its attendant
adverse health effects. The idea is
to work with Eversource and HEET to
structure a pilot.

6. Use all means possible to limit new
fossil fuel infrastructure:
The CCWG has endorsed an idea to
amend the special permit process in
Cambridge, making it more difficult
for new construction to use fossil
fuel infrastructure. Since the CCWG
concluded this work, the Attorney
General has opined that this approach
was not in line with the state building
code. The question is whether there is
any path for Cambridge to incentivize
developers and builders to have
no new fossil fuel in their buildings
through the special permit process.
This proposal from Brookline activists,
who had tried to institute a ban on all
new gas or fossil fuel connections
in 2019, appeared feasible until very
recently when the AG ruling was issued.
Despite a well reasoned, clear legal
rationale that it could work, in light of
the AG ruling, Cambridge would need
to file a home rule which may or may
not be approved.
Attention on this question of requiring
no new fossil fuel infrastructure is now
directed to the stretch energy code
update in draft [straw] proposal form.
The current climate actions as written
into ordinance and the Net Zero Action
Plan are not sufficient to reach our

19

emissions reduction goals, and new
buildings are in planning now, making
new and more aggressive plans crucial
in the climate emergency. The state
has released the net zero stretch
energy code draft, and it will not do
enough. The City Council and the City
have advocated for a better code and
should encourage all stakeholders to
follow suit.
RECOMMENDATION: Pursue the
Special Permit route to ending new
fossil fuel infrastructure in large
buildings, and work with the legal
department on whether there is a
way to craft an incentive system
that could pass legal review. And
advocate at every level for a strong,
true net-zero stretch code that would
allow municipalities to mandate all
new buildings and major renovations
decarbonize.

ARPA funds and HEART

I am sorry that i could not attend the April 20 finance committee hearing. Regarding the HEART proposal, i am in
complete support of the effort to find alternative methods of responding to certain situations which are now handled by
the Cambridge police.
Regarding the use of ARPA funds, i know only too well that families and individuals in the Cambridge community are
suffering as a result of COVID and the inequities brought about by racism and sexism and discrimination regarding sexual
orientation.
I believe that alternatives to current police procedures should be funded, in the near and long term by funds currently in
the police department budget. The BLACK LIVES MOVEMENT has rightly called for a transfer of funds from the police to
alternate community responses when possible.
The HEART proposal will need ongoing support, long after ARPA funds are fully allocated. The only responsible funding
path is the use of funds in the current police budget or an ongoing funding from general funds. I would also expect that
HEART would be far more specific as to how funds would be used than currently seems available to the public.
Poverty, homelessness, lack of food security, healthcare inequities, lack of internet, diminished education opportunities,
job and business losses etc. that were made more severe due to COVID should be addressed by ARPA funds.
Thank you for your dedicated efforts on behalf of justice.

Please find below the letter from Dr. Basu (cc'd) that we were not able to read completely today ~ in particular the last
and most important paragraph on health was cut off.
Thanks,
Eric
***
Good afternoon Finance Committee:
My name is Dr Gaurab Basu and I live on Hubbard Ave. I have a masters in public health, I'm an internist and
co-director of CHA’s Center for Health, Equity, Education & Advocacy. I served on the Climate Crisis Working
Group and on the Net-Zero Task Force.
I would like to address the Jerry’s Pond ARPA proposal for Rindge Ave. which restores the pond’s banks and
de-paves large impervious areas while creating a safe new green space along Rindge Ave. with a large tree
canopy, areas to walk and sit by the pond and fully separated bike and walking paths.
Neighbors in the Rindge Towers and Jefferson Park represent an especially vulnerable population, often
lacking access to green spaces and we know this area is already facing climate risks including heat island and
flooding.
Further, Rindge Ave. serves an on-ramp for Routes 16 & 2 which Mass-DOT noted as having two of the top
five worst traffic times statewide.
This ARPA proposal offers a unique solution centered on environmental justice, climate resilience, complete
streets and ecological restoration along Rindge Ave.
It creates a new linear park with many trees, with enough space to separate bikes and pedestrians while depaving and restoring ecosystems.
As a doctor, I would like to focus on the direct health benefits which are critical as we come out of the
pandemic. Planting a new canopy along Rindge Ave. mitigates heat island, improves air quality and reduces
flood risk while addressing health inequities including asthma, COPD, heart disease and mental health
burdens disproportionately impacting neighboring residents.
It’s a clear opportunity to address health inequities while adding climate resilience and complete streets.
I urge you to fund this proposal.
Thank you ~

Good Afternoon,
As a resident of Cambridge I do not support a plan that will remove all metered parking between Beech Street
and Roseland on Mass Ave. Porter Square has already been redesigned within the last few years to increase
bicycle safety. The MBTA wires are already deactivated, we need to have them removed so Parking can be
retained on Mass Ave. We have the time to do this right. A design needs to be found that allows for safe
streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and disabled. If the requirements and deadlines of
the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a design that meets these goals the ordinance needs to be
changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should include an automatic deadline extension so no more separated
Bicycle lanes are started until after the MBTA wires are removed.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
Best,
Eric

Good afternoon,
We do appreciate the proposed relocation of our valet spots. That said, the possibility of moving our valet spots further
down Mass Ave. (and not around the corner) is more conducive to the operation of our business. Clearly it’s not
“impossible” because the City is allowing a section at 1953 Massachusetts Avenue to keep a loading zone. I don’t think
everyone realizes the amount of additional congestion this will create on Upland and huge increase in double parking on
Massachusetts Avenue. Back in 2014 The Community Development Department found the neighbors had issues with
noise from cars/unloading trucks, delivery schedules, increased traffic from more hotel rooms, and concern that
residents will use parking stickers to park on Upland Street creating further pressure on a limited amount of on street
parking. The neighbors don’t have an issue now because our valet spots were approved and located on Massachusetts
Avenue. The current location of the valet spots makes it easy for valet and front desk to explain and properly navigate
our guests away from Upland.
You all were elected to represent all of Cambridge not just the small percentage of individuals that are demanding
separated bike paths. This change is going to negatively impact our business for the foreseeable future creating negative
reviews and new operational hazards.
We have absolutely no issue with safety improvements in Porter Square (we proposed the blinking cross walk light in
front of Porter Square Hotel back in 2018 for fear someone would get hit). We are hoping a better solution can be found
which will reflect the city’s safety improvements while not damaging the hotels daily operations.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
Sincerely,
Curtis

Mass Ave Bike Lane Reconstruction

Hi there,
I wanted to send over a note in strong support of the partial Mass Ave reconstruction proposal including improved bike
lanes. As a Cambridge resident who walks, drives and bikes around the area, this project feels like a no brainer to
improve quality of life in Cambridge.
All the data that I am aware of shows that improving bike lanes will not only benefit those who already ride (>30% of
Cambridge residents biked >2x/month in 2020) but will also go a long way towards helping those residents (53% per the
city's survey) who don't bike but would like to. For example, my parents will come into the city to visit and they want to
bike to different neighborhoods but are afraid to do so given the state of bike lanes. Building more improved lanes and
making it easier to explore the city will bring more comfort, more casual neighborhood to neighborhood trips, and more
support for our local businesses as a result.
I'm very optimistic that we can continue making strides on bike infrastructure to make Cambridge a more calm and
pleasant city to live in with less focus on cars!
Thank you,

Porter Square Bike Lane Plan

Dear Councillors and City Officials:
This is to express my strong opposition to the misguided plan to replicate the deeply flawed North Cambridge
traffic design, this time in Porter Square.
The goal of eliminating parking for some of the Cambridge businesses most reliant upon it is absurd, and will
once again reflect the prioritization of young, white, affluent cyclists without disabilities over everyone else
who uses the area's roadways, whether as commuters, business owners, patrons, or employees.
Please note that there is no reason cars and bus lanes can't coexist. Indeed, bus-priority lanes should be
promoted and could easily accommodate cyclists as well, thereby granting this small fraction of the public -who use bike lanes only about half the year -- the safety of a wider lane used primarily by buses, which
actually carry a diverse ridership of many thousands of people every single day.
It does not go unnoticed that major retailers in the area such as Stop & Shop, with the luxury of built-in
parking, will not be harmed by the ill-advised plan to replace parking (in constant use by many people all year
long) with bike lanes (used by less than 10% of people on average and even fewer during the 50% of the year
when it's cold and/or wet). It will be regular people whose lives and livelihoods you disrupt for the
convenience of a privileged few.
Please do not shrug your shoulders and point to the cycling ordinance. As has been noted, if the Constitution
of the United States can be amended, the errors of a municipal by-law can be corrected.
Sincerely,
Charles Harrington

I write again to express my strong support for Policy Order POR 2022 #29 from Vice Mayor Mallon
and Councilors McGovern, Simmons, and Toner "that the City Manager is requested to confer with
the Economic Development division and other appropriate departments with the intention of
conducting a study to collect relevant economic data relating to business impacts from bike lane
installations, positive or negative, which will help inform future installations of bike lanes along
commercial corridors."
Common sense would suggest that such a study be undertaken before, and not after, the wholesale
redesign of traffic and parking patterns as they relate to businesses and residents on a main
thoroughfare such as the one implemented during the dead of night in North Cambridge last year,
but here we are.
I commend several members of the Council for acknowledging that they have a responsibility to the
City, its residents, and its businesses to act in the common good and not simply shrug their
collective shoulders and point impotently to the Cycling Safety Ordinance that we now know to be
deeply flawed. After all, if the Constitution of the United States can be amended, a local ordinance
can be improved to reflect the community's input and experience. The first step is to quantify that
experience through this study. If there is no impact or the impact is positive, then the current
situation need not change or could even be expanded. If the impact is negative, as the chorus of
residents, small business owners, their employees, and their patrons would seem to predict, then the
mistake must be acknowledged and the situation corrected.
More and safer bicycle routes are a laudable goal, but there is a better way to achieve them than the
debacle that unfolded in North Cambridge. There are certainly more voices to be heard than those of
the marginal number whose convenience pushed loading zones into residential streets and left
businesses struggling to survive.

Charles Harrington

Dear City Councilors and City Officials:
In recent weeks, countless residents of Cambridge have made plain their feelings on the
well intentioned but poorly executed traffic redesign on Mass Ave in North Cambridge. I
wish to thank Councilor Simmons and Toomey for sponsoring Policy Orders POR 2021
#276 and #277 to address them, and I urge all of you to support these orders.
It has been nearly impossible to access several of the businesses and services I normally
visit. I gather I'm not the only one: an Arlington shop owner told me the wholesale
elimination of parking for his rivals' customers was the best thing that had happened
since the pandemic started. That's great for him and Arlington, but for Cambridge? For
its businesses and their employees? For the neighboring families whose residential
streets have become de facto loading zones? Not so much. The question put to the
Council now is who it represents: the people who live and/or work in Cambridge or
businesses in neighboring communities.
I wish to be clear that bus lanes are a wise investment for Cambridge, and to the extent
that they transport many thousands of people per day to and from work, school, and
other obligations they are not the problem. Buses are egalitarian, and even if the MBTA
has reduced service on the one bus line that uses the North Cambridge lanes, they will
always be a value to people who are older, mobility-limited, or running errands that
require carrying large packages. The same cannot be said of the exclusive bike lanes

that run parallel to Linear Park's existing off-street bike path and duplicate its purpose.
On one day last week, I observed these bike lanes to be completely devoid of use even
as they prevented people from accessing Mass Ave businesses; the folks who work on
MAss Ave say they see it every day. This will continue through the winter, of course,
and next year when their use picks up again they will benefit the same very narrow slice
of the public who are young, fit, generally affluent, and overwhelmingly white, whose
convenience will once again trump the needs of people who must go to work, transport
their kids and parents, and conduct the business of day-to-day life.
Finally, I urge you not to exercise your charter right to delay the important steps
outlined in Policy Orders POR 2021 #276 and #277. Unless one believes that the current
traffic congestion, residential disruption, and business losses in North Cambridge
are optimal, improvements bear consideration and contemplation.

Dear City Councilors and City Officials:
I strongly support bus lanes on Mass Ave as a way to promote
public transportation and support the residents and workers who
use it. Bus lanes improve the ability of students, workers, and
families to get about the city year-round, regardless of age,
income, or physical disability.
The new exclusive bike lanes in North Cambridge, which are a
stone's throw from and parallel to an exclusive bike path that runs
from Arlington to Somerville, do not bring such benefits. They
have pushed traffic onto residential streets and made it difficult to
access businesses on Mass Ave, which in itself is troublesome,
but the fact that they were rushed into place in near-secrecy at the
expense of long-time local residents to benefit a very small slice of
largely white, generally affluent people without physical disabilities
is even more problematic. The number of bike lane users, which
is negligible compared to those who travel the area by car and
bus, will soon drop to almost zero as snow, ice, and freezing
temperatures arrive, but the consequences for the rest of us will
remain.
I am therefore requesting that you vote to support Policy Order

my thoughts on bike lanes in Porter Square (i love them!)

To the City Council members-First of all, thank you for accepting public comment on the subject of the proposed bike lanes in Porter Square.
To start with the most important part of this message--I am asking that you support the proposed addition of
PROTECTED bike lanes on Mass Ave in the upcoming meeting. One of my favorite parts of living in Cambridge (I'm a new
resident) is the focus that this community has on accessibility for all (especially non-drivers) and I believe that these bike
lanes are an important part of that. I do own a car but prefer not to use it when I don't have to. Bikes keep our cities
more nimble (less traffic) healthier (more exercise, less pollution) and in better spirits (due to reduced traffic).
On a personal note, I was riding my bike in Back Bay a few summers ago (July '20) in a non-protected bike lane and was
"doored" when a recently parked car opened their door to get out. It was terrifying--I ended up bleeding in the street.
The encounter was certainly the driver's fault--he should have looked--but honestly it was traumatic for all parties
involved. Drivers aren't trained to look for approaching bicyclists and the city infrastructure set us up for this
unfortunate encounter. I feel lucky that there were no cars driving by at the time and that my injuries weren't worse.
I know that the businesses on Mass Ave oppose this change, and I urge you to prioritize the safety of local residents over
the perception that all business patrons require parking. Their rhetoric about the City of Cambridge planning to "give
away Porter Square" is unnecessarily dramatic and is out of line with my experience living in Porter thus far.
I'm happy to discuss my opinions at greater length if you would like. But I ask that you vote in support of the bike lanes
and biker safety at this upcoming meeting.
all the best,
Casey Silver

Please Postpone Implementation of Separated Bicycle Lanes!

As a longtime resident of Cambridge, I do not support a plan that will remove all metered parking
between Beech Street and Roseland on Mass Ave, and most of it between the Arlington line and
Harvard Sq. I have lived on Upland Road near Mass Ave for almost 40 years and enjoy the
vibrant mix of shops, restaurants, and other services right in my neighborhood.
It is important that the needs of all stakeholders - pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders,
drivers, young, elderly, disabled, and more - be considered, but the current plan is privileging
able-bodied cyclists above all others. Traffic and (very limited) parking will be diverted into
residential neighborhoods, and businesses/restaurants will suffer and fail, as Mass Ave becomes
a thruway for cyclists and vehicles that cannot stop to patronize them.
Porter Square has already been redesigned within the last few years to increase bicycle
safety. The MBTA wires are already deactivited, and the we need to have them removed so
parking can be retained on Mass Ave. We have the time to do this right. A design needs to be
found that allows for safe streets and also supports our residents, businesses, elderly and
disabled.
If the requirements and deadlines of the Cycling Safety Ordinance do not allow for a good design
that meets these goals, the ordinance needs to be changed. The timeline for Mass Ave should
include an automatic deadline extension so no more separated bicycle lanes are started until
after the MBTA wires are removed and a plan is developed that takes all needs into
consideration.
I can only believe that the negative consequences of the ordinance were not recognized when it was
passed. It is not too late to correct the problem and change the ordinance so that a plan is
implemented to the benefit of all.
Please do the right thing now. Thank you.

Support for Charter Right #2, POR #6 and #3

Dear City Council, City Manager,
I am contacting you as a resident of Porter Square. I urge you to support Charter Right #2 and Policy
Orders #3 & #6.
Policy Order # 3 protects against the removal of all metered parking on Mass Ave by requiring the
MBTA wires will be removed. Policy Order # 6 protects Porter Square from losing all metered parking
on Mass Ave, in just a few months. Construction is needed for this most complex section of road. Porter
Square has already been recently redesigned to increase bicycle safety, and the new improvements are
working. Please include Porter Square in the construction timeline, we need to do this right.
I'm not against bicycle safety. We need safe roads for all who use them, and for our city to support all
our residents and businesses. I have another meeting on Monday and cannot, unfortunately, attend the
City Council meeting in person.
Sincerely,
Susan Labandibar, 9A Forest Street

PLEASE ENTER INTO PUBLIC RECORD VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER #2 #3 AND #6

We are life long residents and property owners on Porter Road. First, we would like to thank the City Council. City
Manager and the team charged with implementing the Bicycle Safety Ordinance for continuing to revisit the best
way to accomplish safety for all on Mass Ave.
Please pass Policy orders #2, #3 and #6. It is critical for our neighborhood to have a well thought out plan to
enable bike safety and keep in mind the needs of other constituents. We acknowledge the need for trying to make
our streets accessible for all but we continue to be extremely concerned over the following issues:

1.

Businesses are struggling and asking for a plan that is acceptable to their business needs. We need to
ensure that customers have access to parking to be able to conveniently use retail, restaurants and
services.
2. Resident Parking is limited in our area. We hope that any plan keeps in mind the needs of residents to be
able to legally park their cars.
3. We need a plan that will not make Mass Ave more congested than it already is. The reduction to one lane
of traffic in North Cambridge is making it more difficult for residents to get to and from their home when using
their vehicle.
4. We hope that by taking the time to do an impact study and coming up with a plan that is based on
consensus the divisiveness this Ordinance has caused can be mitigated.
We are concerned with maintaining the character of our neighborhood in North Cambridge and Porter Square.
hope that the City Council approves Policy orders #2, #3, and #6 .
Thank you

communication #388, Oscar Wilde on parking on Mass Ave

Dear Clerk Wilson and City Councillors,
Reading the summary of the April 25 City Council agenda, I noted that
"Oscar Wilde" sent a communication "regarding Parking on Mass Ave"
(Communication #388).
Over the past several months, you have received many messages from
Cambridge residents, business owners, and others expressing strong
opinions, both pro and con, about the proposed installation of
protected bike and bus lanes and the loss of some on-street parking
spaces on Mass Ave.
Could it be that the city's vigorous civic debate over the very definition of
"safety" and the extent of parking "rights" has raised Oscar Wilde from
the dead?
Should we expect William Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson to weigh in,
too? Will the drama playing out on our streets inspire tragedy or comedy,
or perhaps a few immortal lines of verse?
Alas, a closer reading of Communication #388 reveals that it was penned
by Lexington resident Ramya Krishnamurthy, whose email signature
includes an epigram often mistakenly attributed to Wilde: “Be yourself.
Everyone else is already taken.”

My own views on the benefits of protected bike lanes and the
importance of implementing the Cycling Safety Ordinance being, I hope,
well known, I will offer instead one of Wilde's actual quotes: "Anyone can
make history. Only a great man [sic] can write it." I think Wilde's words
may be applied to the Council's ordinance-writing powers.
Please use your power to ensure that Cambridge remains a leader in
sustainable, active transportation. Stay the course and do not unwrite the history the Council made in ordaining the Cycling Safety
Ordinance.

City Council; City Manager; City Clerk
Please approve Calendar Item #2 and Policy Orders #3 and #6

Dear City Council and City Manager,
We are at another important juncture in the reconfiguration of Mass Ave and I ask you to please
approve Calendar Item #2 (the City Manager's recommendation for partial construction along
MassAve4 sections A&B) and Policy Orders #3 and #6. Together, these items address many of the
concerns raised by residents and small businesses during multiple community meetings.They allow
for a more thoughtful and hopefully a broader community discussion about the design along this
important commercial stretch.
The City has asked us to celebrate National Small Business Week May1-7, and I hope the Council
recognizes that your approval of all these items is critically important to their future. Even without
completion of the planned economic analysis, the businesses know, based on their customer base,
that the removal of all parking will irreparably harm them. If Calendar Item #2 and Policy Orders #3
and #6 are not passed, parking in residential neighborhoods will be negatively affected, since the lost
Mass Ave parking will be offset by installing metered spots in locations previously used by residents.
I can only surmise when the Cycling Safety Ordinance was passed, its considerable negative impact
on small businesses and residential neighborhoods was not fully appreciated. Approving these 3
items allows you to set the record straight---- that it was not your intention to harm small businesses.
Please give Cambridge's small businesses a chance to survive by approving all 3 items.
Kind regards,
Arks Smith

Please Pass Charter Right #2 & Policy Orders #6 & #3
Online Petition 1285 04252022.pdf

We are writing to show our support for Calendar Item #2 the City Managers recommendation for partial
construction for the MassAve4 and Policy Orders #3 and Policy Order #6 to include Porter Square Beech St to
Roseland on the same time frame as the Mass Ave 4.
Porter Square has already been recently redesigned to increase Bicycle safety, and the new improvements are
working. Porter Square is a very complex intersections of Streets and the design should be done thoughtfully
so it works for every-one whether they travel by Bike, Car, Bus, Subway, or foot. The removal of the Catenary
wires, and longer time from will allow for a better plan that will not have to be redone. Bicycle safety is vitally
important, but it needs to be done without endangering businesses, and our residents.
The attached petition now has over 1,285 names. The signatures are growing rapidly from the 1,050
submitted just a few weeks ago, The support for Roads that work for everyone is growing on Facebook, and
discussion pages as more people become aware of the plans to remove 95-100% of parking from Mass Ave if
the MBTA wires stay up, and even if the wires are taken down only 40 - 50 % of curb use will remain to be
shared between Loading zones, Bus stops, Crosswalks, outdoor dining, and parking.
In the last election for City Council only 1/3 of registered voters cast a vote. The number of votes to win was
extremely low for a city of this size, 2, 182 votes out of a city of with 67,681 registered voters. Council
Members may be saying that they are responding to the voices of those that voted them in, but your
responsibility is deeper than to that small group.
You need to govern for every-one and be respectful to all Stakeholders. Passing major legislation that affects
so many in the middle of a pandemic without proper notification, or any economic or feasibility study is not
good governance. There is a reason why the main sponsor of the ordnance was voted out. There is a reason
why 2 out of the top 4 candidates ranked by #1 votes did not sign the Bicycle Safety pledge. People have a
right to have their City support their businesses, their elderly, their disabled and not deny them the right to
access services, and to earn a living. People are realizing that elections have consequences. They are realizing
that if their Council Members are not working for them, it is time to pick up a ballot and get government to
change.

We the undersigned request that the City of Cambridge:
*Appoint a City-Wide Project Manager in Charge of the construction of protected bicycle lanes
throughout Cambridge with the authority to reach out to the needed city departments to address
concerns. The City-Wide Project Manager should work along with a group of Stakeholders that is
specifically charged with oversight of how all these segments of protected bike lanes affect the city
as a whole.
*Require an Evaluation process with goals and target points set, to be used on new and existing
protected bike lanes constructed as Cambridge as a whole. A structured evaluation process is
needed to determine if the design is working to achieve its stated goals and if it needs to be
adjusted. Results should be made public and available no later than 3 months after the protected
lane construction or March 1, 2022 for sections already completed. Comparisons of before and after
construction should include:
• The number of Accidents and severity of accidents involving bicycles
• Is it increasing Bicycle ridership
• Business effect revenue and closure rate
• Resident’s ability to park, and traffic concerns
• Effect on Commuters of all major modes of Transportation- Car, Bike, MBTA
*Adoption of Shared Parking programs that would allow temporary on-street parking on residential
streets during daytime hours is needed to compensate for the removal of Parking spaces on Mass
Ave.

Multi-family housing action needs leadership

Dear City Councillors,
On your agenda tonight there is a fairly muddled and inconclusive letter from the Planning Board that ends by asking for
your input on "specific policy objectives".
Having followed the Planning Board discussions closely, I want to make sure you're aware that this request is largely a
result of bad-faith concern trolling from Board members who do not want to see rezonings that encourage the creation
of multi-family housing. However, the request is a valid one and I hope you will take the time to consider this
opportunity seriously.
There has been a serious absence of leadership in this process. Neither the Council, nor the Planning Board, nor CDD
have thus far articulated a specific, ambitious plan for rezoning our low-density residential neighborhoods, let alone one
that would significantly encourage and allow the production of multi-family housing.
I hope you will not simply have another round of discussions where you all state the general values you want to see from
such a process. These values are important but they have already been laid down. We all know that we want to make
our neighborhoods more fair, walkable, inclusive, and affordable to a wider variety of residents. The Planning Board has
demonstrated some of the tensions that come up in doing so; in particular, I was happily surprised to see that they
seemed open to allowing greater heights if it could mean more open space, which I think seems like a win-win. But now
it's probably time for someone to figure out what kinds of specific policies can be effective and attract majority support
from the Council. (ABC would be eager to help and assist in that - feel free to look at our resource page on the topic, or
the slides and speaker notes from our recent Zoned Out presentation.) There is so much work left to do to make
Cambridge's housing stock abundant, affordable, and available for all, let's not let this particular aspect of it die on the
vine.
Thank you,
Allan Sadun

The City Council was deeply saddened at learning of the death of William J. Norton on

WHEREAS:

The City Council was deeply saddened at learning of the death of Mary M. (Sullivan)
Carven on April 10, 2022; and

WHEREAS:

Mary was born on April 23, 1949, and was the daughter of Marion (Colarusso)
Sullivan and the late Walter J. Sullivan, Mayor Emeritus City of Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

Mary was the beloved wife of the late William R. Carven and the very devoted mother
of William Jr. and his wife Elizabeth, Christopher and his wife Brenda, Michael and
his wife Kate, and James and his wife Jessica. She was the cherished “Nannie" to
Grace, Mary, William III, Christopher Jr., Donovan, Laken, Michael Jr., Olivia, Eloise,
and Duke; and

WHEREAS:

Mary grew up in her beloved hometown of Cambridge, where she was a member of St.
Paul’s Church. She graduated from Mount St. Joseph Academy and the Mary Brooks
School. On a snowy afternoon the day after Christmas in 1970, she married the love of
her life and best friend, William “Whitey” Carven. Over the course of their 49 years of
marriage, Mary and Whitey raised their family in Hanover, cheering on their boys from
the sidelines of every sports field or court imaginable. She welcomed her sons’ friends
into her home, laughing and hugging everyone who walked through her door. She had
a special way of making everyone she met feel loved; and

WHEREAS:

Mary’s first job was being a mother, she also brightened the lives of countless students
over the course of her 25 years in the classroom. She had a deep faith and was a
parishioner of St. Mary’s Church, teaching religious education there for many years.
She loved sunshine, blue skies, birds (always seen in 4s), and beaches, and she and
Whitey cherished every moment of their retirement in their little slice of paradise in
Delray Beach, Florida. We would be remiss if we didn’t mention that she could also
bargain shop with the best of them - her grandchildren being the lucky recipients of
many of Nannie’s finds! Above all though, family was her life. She was utterly
devoted to her husband and four boys – and they to her; and

WHEREAS:

Mary’s passing will leave a void in the lives of all her surviving family, her siblings
Marion Murphy and her husband Patrick, Maureen Santoro and her husband Richard,
Walter Sullivan Jr. and his wife Susan and Michael Sullivan and his wife Denise; and

WHEREAS:

Mary will be sorely missed by all she touched and loved; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Community Center (CCC) has been planning to expand their mental
and behavioral youth and family health services into an unused Cambridge Health
Alliance facility located at 205 Western Avenue; and

WHEREAS:

In June 2019, the CCC applied for and received the necessary zoning relief needed
from the Board of Zoning Appeals for a change of use to social center during that
summer; and

WHEREAS:

At that time, the City inspected the site and found both the HVAC and elevator weren’t
functioning properly and the building could not be occupied until those issues were
resolved; and

WHEREAS:

Neither the HVAC nor the elevator were repaired, and the temporary zoning expired
without the Cambridge Community Center using the space; and

WHEREAS:

In September 2021, the Cambridge Community Center hired a full-time Social Worker
who has advanced our efforts in this area and they also have been able to attract
additional funding and interest to support this initiative; and

WHEREAS:

The goal of this new programming is to increase access to mental/behavioral health
treatment for community members by reducing barriers related to logistics and stigma;
and

WHEREAS:

These mental/behavioral health needs issues existed in our community prior to
COVID, but they significantly increased during the pandemic and this program would
help connect many residents to the mental/behavioral health services that they need;
and

WHEREAS:

There is a significant lack of mental/behavioral health services in Cambridge and in the
region, even as more residents are in need of these critical services; and

Packet Pg. 802

WHEREAS:

Specifically, the Cambridge Community Center hopes to provide:

1. Support for youth with high-level mental/behavioral health risks through
therapeutic treatment (with caregiver consent). These services will take place
during program hours. Services will be provided in a setting that’s familiar to
the youth at a time and location that’s convenient for their caregivers.
2. Support for caregivers who require additional support and/or therapeutic
treatment themselves. Caregivers will be able to receive these services while
their children are being cared for in our program; and
WHEREAS:

CCC has asked the City administration to determine if the building would still be
available for use and what repairs to 205 Western Avenue would be needed to inhabit
the space and provide these critical services; and

WHEREAS:

No information has been provided since meeting in November 2021; now therefore be
it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Heath Alliance, the Department of
Public Works, the Inspectional Services Department and other relevant departments
regarding the building condition and what repairs are needed at 205 Western Avenue to
allow the Cambridge Community Center to house their program; and be it further

WHEREAS:

The City Manager and Cambridge Traffic and Parking Planning Department have
requested approval at the April 11th City Council meeting and now before the council
for a vote tonight, April 25th, of a “partial construction plan” for segments of
Massachusetts Avenue from Dudley Street to Beech Street and Roseland Street to
Waterhouse Street sections of the “Mass Ave 4” portion of the project to be completed
no later than April 2026; and

WHEREAS:

Many in the Massachusetts Avenue and broader community – residents, property
owners, small businesses, and nonresident patrons – have all expressed concerns about
the potential loss of 90% of all parking on Massachusetts Avenue and the negative
impact on residents and small businesses up and down Massachusetts Avenue, unless
the MBTA removes the catenary wires along Massachusetts Avenue and parts of the
median strip are removed which will possibly save 50% of parking spaces on the
avenue; and

WHEREAS:

It is stated intent of the Cambridge Traffic and Parking Department to complete the
project by December of 2026 but with the expectation that the catenary wires and
significant portions of the median strip will be removed before beginning the “partial
construction” implementation of the Cycling Safety Ordinance which will allow the
retention of approximately 50% of parking; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Traffic and Parking
Department to work diligently with the MBTA to remove the catenary wires as soon as
possible, and/or investigate the possibility of the City removing the catenary wires
itself and commit to moving forward with the design and installation of the proposed
“partial construction” bike lanes only when the wires have been removed; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Council ask the City Manager for language that may be needed to adjust
and update the Cycling Safety Ordinance to reflect this change in the current timelines
as soon as possible, while keeping the overall time frame of the ordinance.

WHEREAS:

The City Council is supportive of the Department of Public Works’ plan for
distributing new trash bins to all residents over the course of a few weeks in June and
welcomes the plan to standardize trash barrels; and

WHEREAS:

The standardization of the bins should have many benefits, including benefits to DPW
workers’ health and better control of rodents; and

WHEREAS:

The standard bin for single- and two-family residences will be either 45 gallons and
residences with more units will be 65 gallons; and

WHEREAS:

The City has successfully reduced the amount of trash the average household
generates, through innovative initiatives such as curbside composting and textile
recycling efforts, such that 35 gallon bins suffice for most households; and

WHEREAS:

The City’s Zero Waste Master Plan anticipates a continued reduction in household
trash as an important part of our sustainability initiatives, to avoid contributing to the
many harmful effects of landfills on public health and the environment; and

WHEREAS:

Many residents want to contribute to the solution and having larger trash bins could
inadvertently send the message that more trash is acceptable, and a large bin may
incentivize residents to produce more waste, not less; and

WHEREAS:

Encouraging households who need only a smaller bin (35 instead of 45 gallon or 45 or
65) to request smaller ones would send a message that less waste is a city goal and
would be in line with the stated zero waste plan, without risking an increase in rodent
activity (which is often related or to dumpsters and uncovered bins); now therefore be
it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of
Public Works to devise ways to encourage residents to request the smallest size they
need and to keep waste output low with the rollout of the new bins in June; and be it
further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager report back to the Council no later than May 1st, 2022.

WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge Traffic and Parking Planning Department and the City
Manager have developed plans for installing “quick build” infrastructure in
furtherance of implementing the Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) in Porter
Square on Massachusetts Avenue from Roseland Street to Beech Street; and
WHEREAS: The City Manager and Cambridge Traffic and Parking Planning Department
requested approval of a delay in implementing this plan due to the need to gather
further community input and analysis of the impact on the Porter Square residents
and businesses and the impossibility of meeting the original deadline but
committed to installing quick build lanes as quickly as possible within this

WHEREAS: The City Manager and Cambridge Traffic and Parking Planning Department have

WHEREAS: Many in the Porter Square and Massachusetts Avenue community - residents,
property owners, small businesses, and nonresident patrons - have all expressed
concerns about the “quick build” plan and its impact on parking and small
businesses in the area and have questioned why Porter Square is being treated
differently than the rest of Massachusetts Avenue to be completed on a separate,
quicker timeline from the rest of Massachusetts Avenue while the MBTA
catenary wires are still in place requiring the City to eliminate more parking than
if it waited until the catenary wires are removed from this section of
Massachusetts Avenue without any compelling reason; and,
WHEREAS: Best practices in urban planning and transportation planning ensures planning is
accomplished with a holistic view and comprehensive approach; and
WHEREAS: It is the stated intent of the Cambridge Traffic and Parking Department to revisit
the Porter Square infrastructure in the future after the catenary wires are removed
to make further changes to this area and this will only disrupt the Porter Square
community twice in a relatively short period of time at substantial expense to the
city; now therefore be it

the catenary wires and median strip are removed so that Porter Square may be

Communicating Information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
The School Committee’s Building and Grounds Sub-Committee held a meeting last week to discuss the
latest update around the framework for COVID-19 management and updates to the health & safety
protocols. The Special Education and Student Supports Sub-Committee also convened and discussed
summer program opportunities within CPS and DHSP (Department of Human Service Programs) and
reviewed the policy around after-school programs for students with disabilities.
Last week, my office hosted an Iftar for Ramadan. Iftar is the meal Muslims eat after sunset during the
month of Ramadan. It was wonderful to meet hundreds of community members and be able to eat and
pray together. I was thrilled to see such a large turnout and hope to meet many more people at our event
next year. Thank you to Vice Chair Rachel, Members Fantani, Wilson, and Weinstein for attending and
Dr. Greer for speaking during the event. Thank you as well to the Cambridge Employee’s Committee on
Diversity, CPS Muslim Affinity Committee, the Islamic Society of Boston, and the custodial staff at
Cambridge Street Upper School for making the event possible.
It was wonderful to help welcome the 2022 inductees to the Derry-Wood chapter of the National Honor
Society at CRLS. I know our students have worked incredibly hard to be a part of the National Honor
Society and that they will continue to engage in our community through acts of service.
April is also School Library Month, a time to celebrate the essential role that school librarians and school
library programs, including our wonderful Cambridge Public Schools Library Team, play in transforming
learning. My Office joined a library appreciation breakfast for the staff at the Cambridge Public Library.
It was wonderful to meet the staff and check out a few books.

On Friday, April 8th, I read along with many students at the Read-a-thon at CRLS. This summer, CRLS
students and faculty will participate in a shared reading experience called One School, One Story.
Students, teachers, administrators, coaches, everyone in the school community will all read the same
book. The Readathon was a 16-hour event in which CRLS students spent the day reading different books
in order to decide which book to read for the One School, One Story experience.
I was also excited to help launch the Liberation Libraries in collaboration with My Brother’s Keeper, the
City Manager and his Office, DPW, the Commission for Persons with Disabilities and the Cambridge
Public Library. The mini libraries are located on street corners around the city and have books that center
Black and Brown authors and will foster understanding around identity, liberation, and Black excellence
at a young age. The libraries are located at the following locations:
• Cherry and Eaton streets, The Port
• Jackson Street and Rindge Avenue, North Cambridge
• Western Avenue and Jay Street, Riverside
• Cedar Street and Rindge Avenue, North Cambridge
• Essex and Harvard streets, The Port
Kindergarteners across the district have a unit about the design process and read a letter I wrote, where I
asked the students what ideas they have for making Cambridge a fairer city for children and families. Last
week, I visited a few Cambridgeport School kindergarten classrooms and saw their amazing city models!
Their vision for Cambridge included a pet daycare, more fruit trees, bicycles for everyone, a building
where people can get free compliments, toy libraries, and stores to have sections that give away free
clothes for those who do not have money. The class visits are always a reminder of how kind and creative
our students are and their willingness to make our community better.
To celebrate Climate Month, I am hosting climate events with students this week, including a Charles
River Clean Up, recycling education events, and tree plantings at a few of our schools.
Finally, the School Committee’s next regular meeting is Tuesday, April 26.

Mayor Siddiqui

Communicating Information on Joint CC and SC Ad-Hoc for Universal

Through the Cambridge Early Childhood Task Force, the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership (B3)
was launched in 2016 to implement a set of recommendations to improve early education and
care throughout the community and to ensure that all children receive high quality early
education and care. B3 is developing and designing a universal Pre-K (UPK) system to include a
program guide for participating programs, and a single point of access for information and
application for families applying for Pre-K within this system.

The B3 has created a structure consisting of a UPK leadership team, an advisory committee, a
family advisory committee, and three task forces. The work of these groups will be led by B3’s
Executive Director and a newly hired UPK Project Manager.
•

•

•

The leadership team represents the school department and city and will make decisions
and advance necessary items to final approval through the school committee or city
council.
The UPK advisory committee is composed of the UPK leadership team and
representatives of the school department, city, and community and will provide expertise
in making final recommendations.
The family advisory committee will consist of Cambridge families with young children.
This group will provide input and feedback through a variety of strategies (focus groups,
surveys, interviews, meetings) to key teams as needed, to ensure family voice is

•

represented throughout the UPK design and development process. The three UPK task
forces will provide expertise and make/advance preliminary recommendations in the
areas of workforce development (i.e., teacher qualifications), program quality (i.e.,
quality standards), and family hub (i.e., application process).
A UPK Project Manager will support the design and implementation of the city’s
universal Pre-K system; managing each constituent group, synthesizing data, supporting
the overall communication strategy, and ensuring timelines are met.

In addition to the B3’s proposed advisory structure for advancing the work of UPK, a joint adhoc committee composed of City Councillors and School Committee Members, chaired by the
Mayor, will regularly meet to hear updates provided by the UPK Leadership Team. The purpose
of the joint ad-hoc committee is to receive frequent updates on progress made, engage in
thoughtful conversations about findings, and provide guidance about implementation for
Universal Pre-K. The ad-hoc committee will be responsible for providing feedback to the
leadership team. The ad-hoc committee will meet every 6 weeks following Memorial Day, in
order to synthesize through updates and provide any necessary approvals on steps towards
advancing the work of Universal Pre-K.

I will keep the City Council informed about the make-up of the ad-hoc and the meeting dates.

Dear Mr. Poftak:
We are writing regarding the MBTA’s on-going efforts to convert the North Cambridge bus facility from
an electric trolley bus facility to one able to accommodate Battery Electric Bus (BEB) technology and
move the MBTA forward on the commitment to electrify the entire 1,150 bus fleet by 2040. We
appreciate the work the MBTA staff is doing on this and the commitment to removing the full catenary
system (wires, poles and underground conduit), which encumbers our right-of-way and limits our
ability to implement improvements for people biking, walking and taking the MBTA along Mass. Ave.
Since the catenary system is no longer serving any transit purpose, it should be removed as quickly as
possible.

While it is critical that the full system be removed, the highest priority is removing the overhead wires
on Mass. Ave. between Roseland St and Beech St. The City’s Cycling Safety Ordinance (CSO) requires
the implementation of separated bike lanes on a number of city streets, including Mass. Ave. The City
is committed to installing separated bike lanes on this section this summer and the overhead wires are
significantly compromising our ability to do so. We implore you to make immediate arrangements to
remove the overhead catenary wires on this section of Mass. Ave. to support critical bike
improvements, while we continue to work together on the plan to remove the full catenary system.
