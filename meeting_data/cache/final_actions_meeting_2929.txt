Date: January 5, 2021
Ref.:

POR 2020 #291, dated December 14, 2020
Re: Data on ShotSpotter, OMEGA Dashboard and COPLINK

The purpose of this response is to address POR #2020-291, dated December 14, 2020, whereby the
City Manager was requested to work with the Police Department to provide data on ShotSpotter, the
Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC) and COPLINK to the City Council stemming from the
October 7, 2020 Public Safety Committee Meeting.
ShotSpotter
Since January 1, 2015, the Cambridge Police Department has received a total of 326 calls to 911 for
gunshots, of which 68 were confirmed gunshot incidents. Of the 326 calls to 911 for gunshots, 185
originated from the ShotSpotter covered area and 36 of these were also ShotSpotter activations
(when ShotSpotter alerts the Police Department). Calls to 911 that are not confirmed as gunshot
incidents often result in confirmed fireworks, vehicles backfiring, tires popping, or other explosivelike sounds.
ShotSpotter has activated 105 times (2 incidents had more than one activation) during the same period
with 35 being confirmed shooting incidents, 40 activations were for a single gunshot, 38 activations
were for multiple gunshots and 27 activations for possible gunshots. As a result of these ShotSpotter
activations, there were 13 arrests made and 8 victims treated on scene. Comparatively, during the
same time period the rest of the City had 7 arrests and 10 victims treated on scene.
As a result of a ShotSpotter activation, Cambridge Police Officers arrived on scene an average of
51 seconds faster than a call to 911 alone, which could be significant in treating a victim and/or
identifying a suspect(s).

What Federal Agencies have access to the BRIC
Direct access to BRIC-maintained data and information systems is limited specifically to authorized
personnel assigned to the BRIC. This currently includes only Boston Police Department personnel.
Key elements of the BRIC’s mission are the analysis of data and information from disparate, trusted
sources; ensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights and civil liberties throughout its operational
procedures; and the sharing of intelligence related to threats to life, property and public safety with a
broad range of law enforcement and public safety stakeholders. As such, requests for information
received by the BRIC are handled on a case-by-case bases, taking into consideration the requesting
entities right to know/need to know, and both the legality and appropriateness of sharing the requested
information. All information sharing policies comply with the City of Boston Trust Act, which forbids
the Boston Police Department, and therefore the BRIC, from sharing information for the purpose of
assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in any way with the enforcement of civil
immigration violations.

Attachment: Data on ShotSpotter and BRIC and COPLINK - March 8 2021 (CMA 2021 #41 : PO response RE: data on ShotSpotter, OMEGA

a

The BRIC administers the Region’s OMEGA CrimeView Dashboard, which a is web-based system
that grants participating local law enforcement agencies from the Metro Boston Urban Areas Security
Initiative (UASI)/ Homeland Security Region, tools to analyze and visualize their crime data. It is used
primarily for identifying crime patterns that cross jurisdictional boundaries. The Cambridge Police
does not share confidential reports with the BRIC/OMEGA CrimeView Dashboard.
The only authorized users of the OMEGA CrimeView Dashboard are BRIC Analysts and authorized
law enforcement personnel from the 9 Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) municipalities that
submit data to the platform; no Federal Agencies have access to the platform. If a Federal Agency
were to request access to Cambridge data from the BRIC or another UASI municipality, they would
refer that Federal Agency directly to Cambridge to request data.

What Federal Agencies have access to COPLINK
Any Police Agency in the Commonwealth that contributes data to COPLINK has access to the data it
holds. The following Federal Agencies have access: FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
and Homeland Security Investigations (which is the criminal investigative section of ICE). The
Enforcement Removal Operations section of ICE does not have access. Information held in COPLINK
is limited to police reports; no intelligence information is held in COPLINK. The Cambridge Police
Department does not share confidential reports (e.g. rape, domestic violence, etc.) with COPLINK.
Records Retention Policies
All Public Safety Agencies in the Commonwealth are required to follow the “Massachusetts Statewide
Records Retention Schedule.” Section J of the Schedule applies to Public Safety Agencies:
https://www.sec.state.ma.us/arc/arcpdf/MA_Statewide_Records_Schedule.pdf
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know.
Sincerely,

Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr.
Police Commissioner

The technology was effective. 3,528 in person early voters for the 2020 State Primary and
14,037 for the 2020 Presidential Election were checked in during those early voting
periods. Without the pads poll workers would’ve had to check in voters via paper “Voter
Lists” return the marked “Voter Lists” to the Election Commission office at the end of
the day/night and the election commission staff would’ve been required to input by hand
all the voter data collected during the week or weeks of early voting into the state’s Voter
Registration Information System. Using poll pads cut down on a tremendous amount of
staff time. At the end of each day the staff simply downloaded the information from the
poll pad and uploaded it to VRIS.

6. Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance
Technology?
•

Yes, this office received 1 request during the Primary early voting period and 1 during
the Presidential early voting period. General information stored on poll pads was
provided such as voter name, address, party, date of birth, and ballot cast or not.

7. What were the total annual costs of the Surveillance Technology?
• Costs - $31,740 for 21 poll pads.
• Annual license charges (software and application warranty) of $300 per poll pad or
$6,300 per year for 21 poll pads.
• Funding Source- FY21 State Primary and Presidential Election operating budgets.
• Personnel costs- The use of poll pads does not impact staff or poll workers’ pay.
8. Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology?
•

No impact. Poll pads were supplied for use at each of the 3 early voting sites. Cambridge
Voters were permitted to vote early at any one of the sites during the early voting period.
Weekdays, evenings and weekends were made available to all Cambridge voters.

RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS). RapidSOS is a web
platform that provides life-saving data directly to 911 and first responders in an
emergency, providing faster, more effective responses. In Cambridge, when callers
contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency Communications on the state’s Next
Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS provides secondary, data-based location
information to ECC through the RapidSOS clearinghouse. The purpose of this
technology is to provide ECC Call Takers and Dispatchers with an accurate phone
number and location information of wireless callers who contact 911 in our jurisdiction.

•

Digital Evidence Management System. Digital Evidence is a software platform system
similar to a document management solution as a platform that supports repository of
current collected public safety records such as 911 calls, Police Record Management
System (RMS), Evidence, Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and other evidence forms
such as photos and other media.
Landline Location Technology. Landline Location Technology is deployed to identify
the location of the caller during an emergency. The information obtained is the address,
floor, office number and/or office/agency name for business lines (landline office phones)
in the City of Cambridge. It does not cover residential properties or other phone listings
as this is for the City of Cambridge business lines (landlines) only. This information is

Registry of Motor Vehicles on behalf of taxpayers who have paid their delinquent Motor
Vehicle Excise tax bills.

•

MUNIS Tax Modules. Used by Finance Department to create Excise, Real Estate,
Personal Property, and Water Bills.

2. Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party?
•

ATLAS RMV Portal. The ATLAS Database is used by the Registry of Motor Vehicles
and Municipalities within the Commonwealth. Other Municipalities are able to view a
Cambridge taxpayer’s information, should that taxpayer contact them. For example, upon
logging in to the ATLAS Database, Cambridge Staff would be able to see that a customer
not only has delinquent Motor Vehicle Excise bills in Cambridge, but also delinquent
parking tickets from Belmont. There is no ability for City Staff to modify a record filed
under a different Municipality, or vice versa.

•

MUNIS Tax Modules. The data is shared with our bill printers. The City produces
approximately: 50,000 Real Estate bills, 55,000 Excise Tax bills, 2,500 Property Tax
bills, and 65,000 Water bills annually. It is unrealistic for us to print this volume of bills
in house, so we use third party printing services. For Water we use Globe Direct and for
Real Estate/Personal Property/Excise we use PKS – Deputy Collector.
From the Munis software we generate a flat file for the necessary bill type and send that
securely to our printers. Our printers are then able to produce the bills included in the flat
file and mail them on our behalf.

There are no personnel costs associated. The current Massachusetts Statutes authorize the
Non-Renew program to charge an RMV Surcharge of $20.00 per each clear transaction
we make through the ATLAS Database. The cost of this Surcharge is built into the fees
that are incurred on delinquent bills.
During the past year there were no costs associated with upgrading, training users, or

Accurint Workstation:
o The Accurint Workstation is a software program utilized by CPD to analyze and
map incident data from the Department’s Incident Database, including arrest and
incident reports; information contained in this database is gathered directly from
QED, the Department’s Records Management System (RMS).
o The Department uses this software to produce daily, monthly and yearly maps;
many that are disseminated publicly in various formats (Public Safety Bulletins,
monthly Bridgestat, CPD Annual Crime Report, etc.).

•

BRIC Omega Dashboard:

•

Coplink:
o COPLINK is one of the “solutions and services” provided through NESPIN (New
England State Police Information Network®). COPLINK is a data sharing and
crime analytics platform.
o NESPIN (New England State Police Information Network®) is the local arm of a
national project known as the RISS Program (Regional Information Sharing
Systems). The goal of RISS is to assist local, state, federal and tribal Criminal
Justice partners by providing adaptive solutions and services that facilitate
information sharing, support criminal investigations, and promote officer safety.
NESPIN is one of only six RISS centers operating nationwide.

•

QED:
o QED currently functions as CPD’s Record Management System (RMS). A
records management system (RMS) is “an agency-wide system that provides for
the storage, retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving, and viewing of
information, records, documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement
operations. In this context, records are limited to documents or electronic files
directly related to law enforcement operations such as incident and accident
reports, arrests, citations, warrants, case management, field contacts, etc.”
o The Department will be switching to Mark 43 this year.

•

Incident Database:
o The Incident Database is a Microsoft® Access database of corrected Records
Management System Data. The database is used to “clean up” or to keep a more
accurate record of the data that comes into the Records Management System
(RMS) (i.e., initially an entry may be coded as a Larceny Motor Vehicle (L-MV)
but through investigation it is determined to be a House Break where a L-MV also
occurred—this database accurately reflects the appropriate Uniform Crime
Reporting/National Incident-Based Reporting System code).

•

CLEAR:
o CLEAR® is a Public Records search engine. For a fee, CLEAR’s database
provides access to thousands of data sets including, address, phone numbers,
billing (utilities, etc.) and credit-related information through public records and
publicly available sources. According to its website:
▪ “Thomson Reuters CLEAR® is powered by billions of data points and
leverages cutting-edge public records technology to bring all key content
together in a customizable dashboard. Locate hard-to-find information and
quickly identify potential concerns associated with people and businesses

specifically marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).

to determine if further analysis is needed. The user-friendly platform was
designed with intuitive navigation and simple filtering parameters, so you
can quickly search across thousands of data sets and get accurate results in
less time.”
o In addition to accessing these public records to gather information on criminal
suspects, the Department utilizes CLEAR to locate victims, witnesses and to
verify background information on applicants (Public Safety Employment or
License to Carry Firearms (LTC)).
•

LexisNexis:
o LexisNexis is a search engine. Users pay a fee to search public records and other
information compiled by the provider. It serves as a research tool used to locate
people, companies, businesses, phone numbers, properties and fragments of
information; this information helps to create a more complete picture of what we
are investigating. (e.g., the Department entered the name and phone number of an
individual who had been the victim of a scam, this search lead us to where the
“scammer” found the victim’s information, potentially creating a solid
investigative lead).

•

Focused Deterrence Database:
o The Focused Deterrence Database uses an algorithm to analyze Records
Management System (RMS) data based on past arrest and incident reports. The
database algorithm identifies individuals who most recently have caused or been
the subject of (i.e., victim/survivor) the greatest social harm and could currently
benefit from social services and a case manager (offender or victim/survivor).
CPD reaches out to individuals identified through the Database to offer them the
option of joining the Focused Deterrence Program.
o “Focused Deterrence” in terms of policing is a strategy that aims to deter specific
criminal behavior through fear of specific sanctions, as well as anticipation of
benefits for not engaging in crime. In its initial iteration here in Cambridge,
Focused Deterrence closely resembled this. There have always been “variants” of
the Focused Deterrence program in practice; here in Cambridge, Focused
Deterrence has morphed into an altogether different program.
o Focused Deterrence in Cambridge does not utilize a predictive policing program,
through the Focused Deterrence Database or otherwise. The department does not
have a “gang database” (or any semblance thereof) and instead pulls information
directly from the CPD RMS.

•

LENS (Law Enforcement Notification System):
o The Law Enforcement Notification System (LENS) is a web-based system which
provides local law enforcement with information on federal offenders currently on
supervision with the U.S. Courts. This release of information is required by the

MAVEN (Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network). MAVEN is a PHIN (Public
Health Information Network) compliant, secure web-based surveillance and case
management system for infectious diseases that enables rapid, efficient communication
among local and state health departments and laboratories. MAVEN allows the
department to conduct case investigations and management.

2. Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party?
•

•

Surveillance data is only shared with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, as
required by state law. Via MDPH, this some of this data is shared with Partners in Health,
who operate the state contact tracing agency. Within MAVEN, we also occasionally
share case data with other local boards of health in order to collaborate on an
investigation. For example, a Cambridge resident who works at a business in Lexington
may be shared with the Lexington BOH, within the MAVEN system.
Aggregated data and data analysis are shared with the public via the City's COVID-19

•

MAVEN remains an essential tool for CPHD to complete state-mandated infectious
disease investigation work. For example, in 2020, CPHD received reports of 928
reportable infectious diseases among Cambridge residents, excluding COVID-19 cases.
There were an additional 2974 cases of COVID-19 in 2020, which is also a reportable
disease.
MAVEN has been crucial in COVID-19 contact tracing and case investigations. All
2,974 cases of COVID-19 in 2020 among Cambridge residents were reported to us via
MAVEN. Any follow up and investigation is logged in MAVEN by public health nursing
and epidemiology staff. For example, a person living in Cambridge who tests positive for
COVID-19 will trigger a notification to CPHD. We will then either send the case to the
State contact tracing organization (within MAVEN, to PIH), or perform the investigation
ourselves. All information, including symptoms, contacts, and behaviors related to
transmission, are logged in MAVEN.

6. Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance
Technology?
•

Yes. An individual requested information on cases at MIT, which we answered using
MAVEN data.

7. What were the total annual costs of the Surveillance Technology?
•

Costs for the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of MAVEN are covered by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health. CPHD staff use MAVEN to do statemandated infectious disease investigations but are not involved in maintenance of the
system.

8. Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology?
•

All confirmed and suspected cases of reportable infectious diseases among Cambridge
residents are required to be reported to the state health department and/or the Cambridge
Public Health Department through MAVEN, where they are managed and investigated.
Representation in the MAVEN system is a function of the distribution of disease in the
Cambridge population and the health care utilization rates among Cambridge residents,
both of which may vary by sub-group within Cambridge. Wherever possible, CPHD
considers the potential over- or under-representation of marginalized communities in
Cambridge in our infectious disease investigation work.

• ATLAS RMV Portal (Parking Management)
• Traffic Signal Detection Cameras (Street Management Division)
• MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units (Street Management
Division)

1. What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year?
•

ATLAS RMV Portal: ATLAS is a web application provided by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to access the RMV system and used by the Parking Management division.
It used by Parking Services staff to issue resident parking permits, view handicap placard
information, and clear holds on licenses and vehicle registrations. No data is collected or
stored, and the public cannot access it.

•

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: These cameras are deployed at a limited number of
signalized intersections across the City. The detection cameras include 360-degree units
manufactured by MioVision and directional cameras manufactured by Iteris. They are
used for detection of roadway users, to classify their mode of transportation, and to
quantify their movements at signalized intersections in the City of Cambridge, and to
assist in the optimized operation of traffic signals. The aggregated data collected will be
analyzed and used to improve the efficiency and safety of operations for all roadway
users. The technology will also provide City staff with continuous roadway user counts to
allow for evaluation of seasonal and annual traffic volume variations to assist in future
design and planning projects.

•

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: These units are deployed in the field
by transportation consultants, at various locations on a temporary basis. The units are
typically attached to a signal, utility, or streetlight pole within the right of way. This
technology collects traffic video and data that is later processed to provide a variety of
traffic related data such as turning movement counts, intersection counts and
classifications, and road volume counts. Additionally, there is an optional “Connect”
component that can be added to Scout units that allows the unit to communicate
wirelessly for monitoring purposes (but not to stream data) and has the capability of
detecting MAC addresses from devices searching for wireless networks within their

range. With the added ‘Connect” functionality, the Scout Unit can detect devices within
an 80-100 foot radius of the unit. The Scout Unit uses MD5 hash function to produce a
128 bit hash value for each MAC address, pseudonymizing the MAC addresses. This
process is unidirectional and cannot be reversed, but the MAC addresses remain unique
and matchable. These hashed addresses and timestamps are stored in the unit during the
data collection period then transmitted to a central system operated by the vendor,
MioVision. The central system then looks to see if the same hashed MAC address has
been recorded previously by other scout units in the vicinity and in the same time frame
and uses any matches to establish travel times.
2. Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party?
•

ATLAS: No data has been shared with a third-party.

•

MioVision Intersection Cameras: These cameras are accessed by the Vendor,
MioVision, and by the City’s signal contractor, Dagle Electric Corporation, for purposes
of set up, training, and troubleshooting of the product. Access is only controlled by
designated city staff and only provided when required for troubleshooting.

•

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: Video from these units is collected
and accessed by Transportation Consultants. Previous deployments took place prior to the
surveillance ordinance and were done without City approvals; therefore we cannot
determine who has accessed the data. Moving forward, a permitting system will allow us
to understand who is collecting data.

3. What complaints (if any) has your department received about Surveillance
Technology?
•

ATLAS: None

•

MioVision Intersection Cameras and MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera
Units: The department has received inquiries about the installed cameras from time to
time, but no inquiries that the department would characterize as complaints. We explain
the use of the technology and that has been satisfactory for individuals inquiring. No
inquiries have been received over the past year.

4. Were any violations of the Surveillance Use Policy found in the last year?
•

No violations have been found.

•

ATLAS: Yes. ATLAS is used daily by Parking Services staff to issue resident parking
permits, view handicap placard information and clear license and registration holds. In
2020, 37,403 Resident Parking Permits were issued. In FY19, the last year for which the
RMV provided this data,there were 17,973 chargeable clears for license and registrations
holds.

•

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: The MioVision units were installed in late 2019 and
are functioning as expected. The vehicle traffic counts collected by the MioVision units
provided insights in changes in traffic volumes and traffic patterns during the Pandemic.
We continue to evaluate the efficacy of bicycle and pedestrian counts generated by the
MioVision cameras. The directional cameras operate as expected and detect vehicles in
order to optimize signal operations.

•

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: Yes. These data collection units are a
significant improvement over past manual and tube data collection methods. In the past,
counts have been taken by hand, which is far more labor intensive and limits the amount
and timeframe of the data collected. Tubes used for data collection frequently
malfunctioned or were destroyed by road traffic or street cleaning vehicles. Overall, the
video-based data collection allows for better data collection, and as a result, far better
data analysis for transportation planning. In addition, it is becoming increasingly difficult
to obtain detailed counts using any other methodology as most vendors are using this
technology. There has been no use of this technology of the past year due to the
Pandemic. These units are typically used to collect data for traffic studies, and changes to
traffic volumes and travel patterns during the pandemic have precluded data collection
for these purposes.

6. Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance
Technology?
•

No.

7. What were the total annual costs of the Surveillance Technology?
•

ATLAS: There is a $20.00 per transaction RMV surcharge for license plate clears. In FY
2019, the last year for which the RMV provided this data, there were 17,973 chargeable
clears for license and registrations holds, which are assessed through a reduction in local
aid provided on the Cherry Sheet Assessments.

5. Has Surveillance Technology been effective in achieving its identified purpose?

•

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: No annual costs.

•

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: N/A. These are typically installed by
traffic engineering consultants as part of the overall cost of a transportation planning or
traffic engineering study, such as a Traffic Impact Study required for a private
development project.

8. Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology?
•

ATLAS: The Portal allows TP+T staff to access detailed personal information about
Cambridge residents. The information accessed is not collected or stored and the public
cannot access it. The information is only accessed by Parking Services staff when issuing
resident parking permits, viewing handicap placard information, and clearing holds on
licenses and vehicle registrations, all of which are requested by the customer. The data
available on the Portal may have a greater impact on the privacy of those individuals who
own a vehicle than those individuals who do not own a vehicle, since staff only access
the vehicle registration data for residents who own cars. Access to the Portal is password
protected and the Parking Services Staff who use ATLAS receive individual, detailed
training which includes best practices for protecting personal information. As such, the
use of the Massachusetts RMV Website Portal does not have any disproportionate impact
on any population.

•

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: Although they are installed in specific communities
that have specific demographics, they observe all users that pass through an intersection,
whether or not those users come from those local communities. Typically, these units are
installed at major intersections which carry both local and regional traffic. The
technology does not retain any personally identifiable information, and does not impact
the drivers, cyclists and pedestrians that are counted by the cameras. As such, the use of
Detection Cameras does not have any disproportionate impact on any one population.

•

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: The units record all users that pass by
the unit, whether or not those users come from those local communities. These units are
also deployed for very short periods of time, further limiting impacts. While data
collection is used across the City, it is possible that data collection, and thus video
recording, will occur most frequently in areas with significant new development, thus
possibly impacting these areas more than parts of the City with less development.
However, these cameras primarily collect data that is not personally identifiable and use
hashing technology to mask MAC addresses that could otherwise be personally
identifiable. Overall, the use of MioVision Intersection Cameras does not have
disproportionate impacts on any population.

• Automated Meter Reading (AMR) System
• AMR Consumer Engagement Tool

1. What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year?
•

Automated Meter Reading (AMR) System. The Water Department’s AMR system is a
radio-based system which transmits on a Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
licensed/reserved frequency. Meter Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every
water meter throughout the city. The MTU transmits water meter reads in a propriety
format. These reads are transmitted every 4 hours on a floating schedule. For example,
an MTU will transmit a read today at 6:00AM, and then transmit a read tomorrow at
6:03AM. The reads are received by the Data Collection Units (DCUs) located within the
city. The DCUs transmit the meter readings, using a cell phone network, to a
communications computer located at the Water Department. The communications
computer then transfers the data to a database computer which translates the data in order
for the city to view the water meter reads. This allows the Water Department to provide
actual reads for billing and allows us to alert customers for potential leaks at their
property. Below is an example of our STAR AMR software and the data collected:

To the Honorable, the City Council:
Re: Surveillance Use Policy and Related Documents
Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge
Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review
and discussion at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting:
•
•
•

A proposed Surveillance Use Policy, which has been approved by the City Solicitor and
the City Manager and requires Council approval;
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, describing Surveillance Technologies which
are subject to the Ordinance, which require Council approval; and
An Annual Surveillance Report compiled from Department-specific Annual
Surveillance Reports concerning the Surveillance Technologies used by those City
departments since December 10, 2018, which requires Council approval.

The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, the Information Technology
Department, the Police Department and all other City departments have worked to complete
these materials for submission to the City Council. Since this is my first submission to the City
Council under the Ordinance, I am also providing background information on the compliance
process which the City Council may find helpful.
Background
The Ordinance was adopted by the City Council on December 10, 2018, after extensive
work between the City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts
(“ACLUM”), Cambridge residents, and City staff. The Ordinance regulates Surveillance
Technology that may be acquired or used by the City and balances the right to privacy with the
need to promote and ensure safety and security. The Ordinance also provides for informed
public discussion about Surveillance Technologies and any impacts they have on the civil rights
and liberties of individuals, communities and groups in the City.
Surveillance Ordinance Requirements
The Ordinance addresses the following key components:

Packet Pg. 94

•

A Surveillance Use Policy, applicable to each City department that possesses or uses
Surveillance Technology or foresees doing so in the near future. The Surveillance Use
Policy must be approved by the City Solicitor and the City Manager and submitted by the
City Manager to the City Council for review and approval.
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, which relate to specific Surveillance
Technologies, must be submitted by the City Manager to the City Council before the City
seeks funds for or acquires Surveillance Technology, uses Surveillance Technology in a
way not previously approved by the City Council, or enters into an agreement to share
Surveillance Technology or the Surveillance Data it gathers with a non-City entity.
An Annual Surveillance Report, submitted by the City Manager to the City Council,
pertaining to each City department whose use of Surveillance Technology has been
previously approved by the City Council in the past year. The first Annual Surveillance
Report is due to the City Council by December 10, 2019. In 2020, and annually
thereafter, the Report is due by March 1.
The City Council must hold a meeting by May 31 of each year to discuss the City’s
Annual Surveillance Reports and must also release a public report summarizing the
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports received by the City Council during the prior
year.

Timing & Content of the Attached Surveillance Use Policy and Reports
The Ordinance requires the City Manager to submit a proposed Surveillance Use Policy
within 180 days after its effective date. The Ordinance took effect on September 10, 2019.
Therefore, a proposed Surveillance Use Policy is due to be submitted to the City Council by
March 8, 2020. Because the first Annual Surveillance Report, which is due to the City Council
by December 10, 2019, assumes the existence of a Surveillance Use Policy, I am transmitting a
proposed Surveillance Use Policy at this time, along with the Surveillance Technology Impact
Reports and Annual Surveillance Report, for the Council’s review and approval.
•

•

•

Specifically, the proposed Surveillance Use Policy includes the following five (5)
appendices:
o Appendix A–a form for City departments’ internal report to the City Solicitor of
technologies that may be Surveillance Technology as defined in the Ordinance.
o Appendix B–a Surveillance Technology Impact Report form.
o Appendix C–an Annual Surveillance Report form.
o Appendix D–a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Report form.
o Appendix E–a checklist for City departments and Compliance Officers to use as a
guide when completing the above-referenced forms.
The attached Surveillance Technology Impact Reports completed by City departments
relate to existing Surveillance Technology covered by the Ordinance. Therefore, the
dates and costs listed are the original deployment dates and known costs.
As this is the first submission of an Annual Surveillance Report under the Ordinance, the
attached Annual Surveillance Report for this year to date does not include information

regarding complaints about Surveillance Technology or about violations of the
Surveillance Use Policy.
Department Compliance Process
For each Surveillance Technology that was determined to be subject to the Ordinance,
Department Heads were asked to review and confirm the applicability of the Ordinance to such
Surveillance Technologies, complete a Surveillance Technology Impact Report, and complete an
Annual Surveillance Report. The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, and the IT
Department worked with each department to review all technologies that potentially fall under
the Ordinance and to ensure that each department’s submission was complete.
Continued Compliance
The City Solicitor will coordinate further trainings to ensure continued compliance with
the Surveillance Ordinance:
• Compliance Officers. Each Department that currently possesses Surveillance
Technology and any Department that seeks to acquire Surveillance Technology in the
future must designate a Compliance Officer. As further explained in the Surveillance
Use Policy, the Compliance Officer will oversee record-keeping within their department
in order to ensure that the department complies with the Ordinance and the Surveillance
Use Policy.
• Training. The Law Department has held several meetings with other City departments
in order to familiarize City staff with the provisions of the Ordinance, the proposed
Surveillance Use Policy, and the types of Surveillance Technologies that must be
reported to the City Council under the Ordinance. I will continue to work with City
departments to continue training about the Ordinance and the Surveillance Use Policy for
City staff.
I respectfully request that the City Council approve the attached proposed Surveillance
Use Policy as well as the Surveillance Technology Impact Reports and the Annual Surveillance
Report that I have also submitted herewith.
I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the December 9, 2019
City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.

The Department Head or Compliance Officer for that City department shall be
responsible for internal record keeping on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or
Surveillance Data by that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data, to
ensure compliance with this Policy.
A. Data Collection.
Surveillance Technology produces Surveillance Data upon which the City relies for
governmental functions. It is the policy of the City to ensure that the Surveillance Technology it
uses collects no more Surveillance Data than is necessary to achieve the specific, authorized
purposes of that particular Surveillance Technology.
In accordance with the Ordinance, the City has reviewed all of the Surveillance
Technology currently in use by City departments as of the Effective Date. The Surveillance
Technology, the departments that use or propose to acquire or use the Surveillance Technology,
the purposes for which the particular Surveillance Technology is used, the nature of the
Surveillance Data the Surveillance Technology collects, and information as to whether the
minimum amount of Surveillance Data necessary is being collected, shall be submitted in a
report to the City Manager by each Department Head for each City department which uses or
proposes to use Surveillance Technology. If any employee, agent, or contractor of any City
department becomes aware of any inaccuracies concerning the use of Surveillance Technology
or Surveillance Data that is collected by a department’s Surveillance Technology other than as
outlined in that City department’s report to the City Manager, that employee, agent, or contractor
is required to immediately report the collection of such Surveillance Data or use of such
Surveillance Technology to the department’s Compliance Officer, the Department Head, the City
Manager, the City Solicitor, or the Personnel Director.
B. Data Protection.
No Surveillance Data shall be stored, accessed, or transmitted without proper encryption,
access and password controls, and access-oversight approved by the City’s Chief Information

Officer or his/her designee in the Information Technology Department (“ITD”). Each City
department’s Compliance Officer shall complete and submit to ITD a list of each type of
Surveillance Technology currently used by that department, the Surveillance data it collects, the
staff who have access to the Surveillance Data, and all other information required under
Subsection A above. ITD shall ensure that proper procedures are in place to protect all
Surveillance Data. In the event that any department is, in the judgment of ITD, unable to
implement the security measures necessary to adequately protect Surveillance Data, ITD shall
immediately contact the City Manager and the City Solicitor, and propose additional measures to
protect Surveillance Data from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure.
C. Data Access.
City employees may only have access to Surveillance Data when such access is necessary
for their official duties. The Department Head or Compliance Officer of each City department
shall report to ITD, the City Manager and the City Solicitor, the name of each employee,
contractor, or other agent that requires access to Surveillance Data. The Department Head or
Compliance Officer shall state the specific Surveillance Data to which each individual may have
access. The City may, at any time, with or without notice to the individual, terminate any
individual’s access to Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data.
D. Data Retention.
Surveillance Data will not be maintained any longer than is necessary to achieve its
approved purpose(s), provided that the City will retain Surveillance Data for the periods required
by the Massachusetts Public Records Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts Municipal
Records Retention Schedule, or any other applicable laws or regulations.
Exceptions to the Massachusetts Municipal Records Retention Schedule may be
requested from the Commonwealth by the City Solicitor at the request of a Department Head as
follows:
1. A Department Head may seek exceptions for a particular type of Surveillance Data by
seeking the exception explicitly in a Surveillance Technology Impact Report or
Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy; or
2. A Department Head may seek an exception for a particular type of Surveillance Data
from the City Manager on a case-by-case basis.

Public and Third-Party Access.

The City shall comply with its obligations pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records
Law, (G. L. c. 4, § 7 cl. 26, and G. L. c. 66, § 10 et seq.), Chapter 2.126 of the Cambridge
Municipal Code (the “Open Data Ordinance”), and any other applicable law, regulation, or order
of a court or state or federal administrative agency of competent jurisdiction that requires the
disclosure of particular Surveillance Data.
The City’s intent is to make as much information as possible available to the public
without compromising the privacy of any Identifiable Individual(s), as defined in Section
2.128.020(C) of the Ordinance. The City shall, to the extent possible and permitted in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, anonymize, aggregate, and/or geomask
Surveillance Data where necessary to protect the privacy of Identifiable Individuals. While some
data may not on its own reveal the personal information of Identifiable Individuals, when
combined with other data it may reveal information that would otherwise be exempt from
disclosure by law. In the event that a City employee suspects that the release of data would
present such a risk, the employee shall report that risk to the Department Head or the
Compliance Officer for that employee’s department and the Department Head or the Compliance
Officer shall contact the City Manager and City Solicitor requesting a legal opinion from the
City Solicitor as to whether the data is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law or
other applicable law or regulation.
Surveillance Data may only be accessed by authorized City employees, as described in
Section IV(C) above, and may only be distributed to third parties in accordance with this Section
V of this Policy. However, any department may share Surveillance Data with the Police
Department under Exigent Circumstances.
VI.

Training.

Upon beginning employment or within a reasonable time after commencing employment,
any City employees or City contractor who will be involved in the collection of Surveillance
Data or use of Surveillance Technology will be given a copy of the Surveillance Ordinance and
this Policy for their review and trained by their Department Head, supervisor, or other
appropriate person assigned to conduct such trainings in ensuring that the activities to be
performed by that staff or contractor comply with the Surveillance Ordinance and this Policy.

Appendix B attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use of
Surveillance Technology.
B. Annual Surveillance Report(s) (Section 2.128.060) in the form provided in Appendix C
attached hereto—submitted annually by the City Manager to the City Council covering
the prior calendar year. The first such report, describing all existing Surveillance
Technologies and Surveillance Data is due to the City Council on December 10, 2019.
Thereafter, the report will be due to the City Council by March 1 of each year.
C. Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy(ies) (Section 2.128.030) in the form
provided in Appendix D attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use
of Surveillance Technology not already covered under this Policy.
When providing any of the above reports or a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use
Policy, a Department Head should pay particular attention to the impacts the use of the
Surveillance Technology has on marginalized communities in the City, including, but, not
limited to, communities of color. For any disparity that exists, the Department Head shall
explain its understanding as to why the disparity exists and how the Department Head intends to
address the disparity.
