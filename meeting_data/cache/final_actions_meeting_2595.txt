hire professional staff and cover additional expenses for continued operations. The Y2Y Shelter
will provide temporary nighttime emergency shelter to 19 eligible Y2Y program participants.

To the Honorable, the City Council:
I am hereby recommending the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment
Authority (CRA) for a term of 5 years. Mr. Bator was first appointed to the CRA in 2012. Mr. Bator
grew up in Cambridge and has raised his three children here.

Mr. Bator has demonstrated a consistent focus on utilizing the resources of the CRA to promote the
public benefit of local development and strategic community investments, particularly beyond the
boundary of Kendall Square. As the Board Treasurer, Mr. Bator has been highly attentive to the
CRA's fiduciary position to ensure that it has the resources to implement projects and programs for
all of Cambridge. He has led the effort to transform the investment approach to preserve and
enhance the CRA's financial assets, and has helped establish protocols for tracking budget expenses.
At the same time, he has encouraged the CRA's thoughtful investment in community capital needs
through the Forward Fund, the purchase of 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive, and other strategic
partnerships with Cambridge nonprofits.
This request to reappointment Mr. Bator is supported by CRA Executive Director Thomas Evans and
Board Chair Kathleen Born.
Therefore, in accordance with Chapter 121B of the Massachusetts General Laws, I am submitting Mr.
Bator's name for City Council confirmation as a member of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. I
am further requesting that this recommendation be forwarded to the Neighborhood and Long Term
Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebrations Committee or other suitable committee for a public
hearing as outlined in City Council Rule Number 32C.

of purchasing sensory bags for police vehicles as a pilot program and report back to the City Council.
We have taken the following measures in response to this order.
The Police Department has ordered fifty (50) sensory “On The Go Bags” containing items that can assist
officers during interactions with individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The bag contains
items such as Hearing Safe Noise Protectors and squeezers. These will assist officers in building trusting
relationships and reduce confusion and fear. The kits will primarily stay with the patrol car; however,
officers may choose to leave an “On The Go Bag” with the child or adult if they deem it necessary.
Cambridge Police officers currently receive training on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during Crisis
Intervention Training (CIT), and in 2019 Autism awareness was included as a component of Annual Inservice Training. The Department is constantly engaging training to enhance our understanding of ASD
and how specifically the sensory kits can assist them, as we recognize that proper training is paramount
to a successful interaction.
The Department will deploy the kits to all marked units (approximately 40 vehicles) as soon as they
arrive and will incorporate the sensory kits into future training.
We continue to remain committed to best practices and strategies to achieve positive engagements and
public trust between the Department and the community.
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed,
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know.
Sincerely,
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr.
Police Commissioner

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate
crisis; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero
emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS:

In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS:

All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS:

Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor,
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no
later than the end of October.

Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment.
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane
with Adequate Directionality.
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle

shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council.

2.2.a

D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a),
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided,
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has
commenced prior to December 31, 2025.
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-byblock analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.
If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that QuickBuild Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection
C.
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle
Lane of Adequate Directionality along
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden
Street;

Packet Pg. 32

Attachment: 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance (POR 2020 #50 : 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance)

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025.

2.2.a

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis.
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment.
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound,
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year.
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however,
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle

Increased Quarantine Capacity Needed for Homeless Population: Cambridge Data Attached
COVID-paper_0325_1127am.pdf

Dear City Leaders:
I hope you and your families are faring well. I want to bring a new public health report to your attention and urge you to
follow its guidance in advancing COVID policy impacting people who are unhoused and living in shelters.
Estimated Emergency and Observational/Quarantine Capacity Need for the US Homeless PopulationRelated to COVID‐19
Exposure by County; Projected Hospitalizations,Intensive Care Units and Mortality One of the co‐authors is a local
expert: Thomas Byrne at BU School of Social Work. See full report attached.
The report makes clear recommendations, some of which are already under consideration here. Importantly, the table
at the end of the document uses CoC data to calculate the need for emergency quarantine units and the cost to obtain
them and sustain services therein. Here is the local and regional snapshot:


In Massachusetts, we need 3,847 new units of temporary housing to safely support people who are living
unsheltered as well as those living in shelters during the COVID crisis. The costs for supplying this capacity and
supporting the quarantine would be $109,063,400.



In Boston, Cambridge and Somerville, we need 1,592 quarantine units at a cost of $48,545,800 for space and
quarantine services.



In Somerville, there are about 14 people who are unhoused; 85 in shelters. The quarantine unit need is
calculated at 57 at a cost of $1,709,500 (for unit capacity & services).



In Cambridge, with about 81 people who are unhoused and 326 in shelters, the quarantine unit need is
calculated at 244 at a cost of $7,326,600 (for unit capacity & services).

That's a small fraction of the vacant dormitory and hotel space in our community at this moment. Available CPA and
other resources at the state and local level should be used immediately to meet this need. Additional ESG and other
monies will be coming from the federal governement.
The basic needs of our most vulnerable community members must be addressed first ‐‐ safe, warm quarantine space
with easy access to running water, soap, bathrooms, showers, and qualified care. Without these measures, the ripple
effect of infection among service providers across many systems (from frontline nonprofit workers to municipal
employees to law enforcement officers) could be devastating. It is clear that the collaboration of the private and
higher education sectors in our community is critical at this moment. The Cambridge nonprofit organizations
providing congregate living, overnight shelter, and day shelter options do not have a way to access additional space
without intervention.
Thank you for your compassionate service. Please let me know if I can offer assistance.

4.1.b

The rapid progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
has raised concerns about the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the homeless
population. According to official reports, 575,000 people in the United States meet the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of homelessness – living in a homeless shelter or a
place not fit for human habitation.1 On any given night New York City and Los Angeles County, two areas
heavily impacted by COVID-19, are estimated to have 70,000 and 58,000 homeless individuals,
respectively.
In recent days, both the State of California and the City of Los Angeles have made substantial funding
allocations to support rapid emergency shelter for unsheltered individuals, outreach for early detection,
and quarantine space. Policing reforms have also been put in place to ensure that homeless individuals
are able to shelter in place should the need arise. The federal government is in the process of
considering additional funding allocations aimed at protecting homeless populations from COVID-19.
This report aims to establish the potential mortality and hospitalization costs of inaction along with
estimating the funding needs associated with a comprehensive plan of action.
Potential impacts of COVID-19 on the homeless population
We estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the homeless population and the homeless and
healthcare systems caring for them. We model our estimates on a variety of severity and fatality
scenarios informed by the unique health burdens facing the homeless population, applied to the age
distribution of the homeless population. Concern has been raised around the potential for widespread
transmission of COVID-19 within the homeless population due to inadequate access to hygiene and
sanitation and the difficulty of early detection among a population isolated from health care. Yet, given
limited understanding around the exact parameters of the virus’ transmission, it is difficult to explicitly
model the potential transmission, and so we simply model a range of infection rate scenarios.
Less widely known—but considerably more important—is the extraordinarily high susceptibility to
symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and fatality among the homeless population due not only to
their advanced age, but also the accelerated physical decline and mental weathering that frequently
results from repeat exposure to harsh elements. For decades, the single adult homeless population has
been dominated by members of the late baby boom cohort (e.g., those born between 1955-1965,
approximately), and the age distribution of homeless populations has shifted upwards as this birth
cohort phenomenon has persisted into older ages.2,3 A recent study of aging trends among homeless
populations in New York City, Los Angeles County, and Boston observed that the modal age of homeless
clients in all cities was between 50 and 55 years. Studies of COVID-19 severity and case fatality suggest
that older populations face risk orders of magnitude higher than those facing younger populations.4,5
Concerns over chronological age are magnified by concerns over accelerated physical decline among
homeless populations.6 Homeless individuals are admitted to the hospital with medical-surgical
conditions 10-15 years earlier than comparable, housed individuals,7 and with age-related impairments

typical of housed individuals 20 years older.8 Early studies of COVID-19 risk factors point to
comorbidities relating to hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic respiratory disease, and
cancer.9 In Los Angeles and other communities on the West Coast, concerns about physical susceptibility
are further heightened by high rates of unshelteredness, which are thought to carry both a generalized
risk of accelerated age-related decline and specific exposures to poor hygiene and respiratory distress.10
Existing studies of homeless populations have observed obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence
between 20 and 30%,8,11 compared to 10% for the general adult population. 12
This study serves two distinct purposes. First, we model potential scenarios of COVID-19 severity,
hospitalization and fatality among homeless populations. Second, we estimate additional homeless
system capacity – through private units as quickly feasible and scalable and otherwise through current
infrastructure that incorporates tenets of social distance and safety - required to manage the acute
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the existing homeless population. We perform this exercise for all
unsheltered persons and homeless individuals in emergency shelter or transitional housing, which are
generally congregate in nature (no private rooms or partitions) and highly dense. We have excluded
families with children, who tend to be sheltered in private rooms or apartments. This exercise outlines
the additional homeless system capacity required for a sufficient response to safely care for the existing
homeless population; it is not intended to prescribe specific solutions, which should incorporate local
conditions and guidance from the CDC and other public health experts.
Modeling Health Impacts of COVID-19 on the Homeless Population
Data and Methods
Because detailed national age distribution data are not available, we drew on aggregate age
distributions for the adult homeless population (age 25+) from the Homeless Management Information
Systems (HMIS) of New York City (NYC) for 2017 and Los Angeles County (LAC) for 2018, two
municipalities with robust social service data infrastructures for which we could readily access data.
(Previous research by this team has found that the age structure of adult homelessness is fairly robust
across states).2,3,13
The most granular geography at which official homelessness estimates are available is the Continuum of
Care (CoC), which is the geographic unit at which federal homeless assistance grants are awarded and
local homeless services are coordinated. These geographies do not map uniformly onto county
boundaries, and we thus interpolate county estimates of these outcomes from CoC-level data mirroring
a process described by Almquist and colleagues.14
We built estimates of the distribution of hospitalization, critical care and fatality for five-year age groups
by modifying the estimates included in the widely publicized Imperial College report published March
16, 2020.4 We used nonlinear regression techniques to approximate rates for five-year age groups
instead of ten-year groups. To estimate potential impacts on the homeless population, we built on the
intuition of existing studies that older homeless populations bear health risks comparable to those of
individuals 15 to 20 years older.7,8 To be conservative, we focused primarily on a 15-year accelerated
aging shift while also reporting 10-year and 20-year shift models. A future scientific report will explore a
wider range of assumptions.
Figure 1 compares the risk curves for homeless populations to the general population using a model that
assumes infected homeless individuals would be twice as likely to be hospitalized, two to four times as
likely to require critical care, and two to three times as likely to die.

Table 1 shows the projected number of hospitalizations and critical care and fatality episodes
anticipated among the homeless population of the United States. These projections are imposed on the
estimated 493,000 single adults experiencing homelessness on a given night (unsheltered PIT counts
adjusted *1.4, see later section on unit estimation method), which creates a conservative estimate of
COVID-19’s impact on the homeless population given that the total number of people experiencing
homelessness over the course of a year is likely 3-4 times that. Our estimates assume that 40% of the
homeless population will be infected at any given time at the peak of the crisis, and that the U.S.
homeless population would have the same age distribution as NYC and LAC grounded in work from a
prior study of aging homelessness.
Findings
•
•
•

We estimate that 21,295 people experiencing homelessness, or 4.3% of the U.S. homeless
population, could require hospitalization at the peak infection rate of 40%, with a potential
range from 2.4% to 10.3% hospitalizations.
Critical care needs could range from 0.6% to 4.2%, with the midpoint scenario seeing 7,145 in
critical care nationally.
Finally, we estimate a wide range--0.3% to 1.9%-- of potential fatality rates, with the central
estimate of 0.7% implying 3,454 homeless deaths. We believe that the true likely fatality
outcome would be on the higher end of this range given the challenge of actually getting

LAC, lower than the national average among the general population. The proportion over age 50, and
thus potentially heavily affected by accelerated aging was 39.7% in NYC and 42.5% in LAC.

Estimating Additional Capacity

We use data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2019 Annual
Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) to create assessments of additional capacity required to
manage the acute effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the homeless population. The following assumptions
were used to develop bed estimates:
•
•
•
•
•

Adult shelters operate at high density. To reduce density sufficient to enable social distancing
by allotting at least 100 square feet per bed, we assume a 50% bed reduction in existing
facilities, which would require an offsetting increase in beds or private units.
The 2019 AHAR unsheltered count reflects persons observed during the PIT count, which is an
estimated 40% undercount due to unobserved persons, based on Glynn and colleagues15.
New units are estimated to cost $25,000 per year, or $68.50 per night based on current national
shelter expenditures16, although accommodations may be made in other facilities.
We estimate a peak infection rate of 40% and keep that constant for our estimates and maintain
that rate – which we know will vary over time -- for our analyses.
Finally, for those who are infected or under observation we estimate an additional $7,500 per
unit for more private accommodations, including rooms in hotels and motels.

Findings
Our estimates suggest the need for an additional 400,000 units to manage the COVID-19 pandemic for
the current, estimated homeless population. This includes:
•
•
•
•
•

•

Approximately 200,000 single adults were sheltered on a given night in January, 2019 (199,531;
US HUD, 2019). To reduce density by 50% while maintaining current capacity would require the
addition of 100,000 units.
211,293 adults and persons in families were enumerated as unsheltered in 2019. Assuming a
40% undercount, approximately 300,000 beds are needed to provide accommodations to all
unsheltered persons.
Of the projected 500,000 total beds needed (300,000 for unsheltered, 200,000 for sheltered), at
a 40% infection rate at a given time, 200,000 of these beds should be suitable for observation of
symptomatic persons or persons under quarantine.
At a cost of approximately $25,000 per unit per year, we estimate the annual cost of meeting
this need at $10 billion.
Assuming a premium of $7,500 per unit per year for more private accommodations for persons
who are infected or under observation, including placement in hotels and motels, this would
require an additional $1.5 billion for those 200,000 beds.
The total estimated cost to meet the additional need is approximately $11.5 billion annually.

Map 2 shows the need for these additional capacity by U.S. county. This map reflects the geographical
heterogeneity in unsheltered and single adult homelessness across the country, with need concentrated
in a handful of areas and municipalities. Ten percent of all counties will need only one, single unit or
bed to accommodate the additional need, and half will need fewer than 10 additional spaces. The
counties in the top 1% of need will each require a minimum of 2,100 additional spaces, with Los Angeles
County facing far and away the greatest need at 65,000 new units.

Given the high transmission rate of COVID-19, concerns have been expressed about the potential risk of
congregate shelters, or shelters without private sleeping and bathing facilities. On March 22, the Centers
for Disease Control issued Interim Guidance for responding to COVID-19 among people experiencing
unsheltered homelessness along with guidelines for homeless shelters and other service providers.
Decisions about the appropriate mix of rapid housing options must be made by individual jurisdictions
based on local population needs, capacity for emergency accommodations, including vacant hotels and
motels, and local government resources, but it is helpful to consider the basic principles of such an
effort:
1) Emergency accommodations with private sleeping and bath space should be the preferred option
for all clients and would be especially beneficial for individuals with known risk factors for COVID-19
complications.
2) Individuals in urgent need of protection – including the elderly, those with severe risk factors for
COVID-19 complications, and those already presenting with respiratory symptoms – must be
accommodated with considerable haste

This means that most jurisdictions will need to use all potential emergency accommodation options to
protect homeless populations from disease risk. We review the specific options individually before
suggesting some technologies that would assist in the broader effort.
Managing Encampments and Unsheltered Homelessness
The recently posted CDC guidance discourages the clearance of encampments that frequently occurs
under normal conditions and can lead to temporary or permanent disruptions that could lead to more
harm than benefit. It recommends basic prevention measures for encampments:
1) encampments members should be encouraged to sleep with 12x12 feet of space per
individual tent
2) public restrooms with water taps, soap and sanitizer should be made available 24 hours per
day, and
3) portable toilets and handwashing facilities should be made available for encampments with
encampments with 10 or more people.
The report does not recommend strategies for encampments where these prevention measures cannot
be implemented. Nor does it make specific prevention recommendations for individuals living outside of
large encampments. We note that in Los Angeles, the city with by far the largest unsheltered
population, only 24% of unsheltered homeless individuals actually live in encampments of any size, with
a much smaller share living in large encampments. A recent study also found that individuals with longer
exposure to homelessness, and thus potential greater health risks, were actually more likely to live in a
sidewalk or alley and less likely to live in an encampment.17 In other words, in many cities, the vast
majority of unsheltered homeless individuals, and an even greater share of the most vulnerable, are
alone, unprotected, difficult to reach, highly dependent on services that may be unsustainable through
the crisis, and unlikely to receive sanitation access.
Those living in encampments or even in individual unsheltered spaces who have the ability and the
desire to shelter in place should be encouraged to do so, because this will reduce demand for other
emergency accommodations. But concerns about the ability to detect disease, maintain sanitation and
meet basic needs – particularly if outreach capacity were to diminish – means that the bar for sheltering
in place would ideally be set high. Building on the CDC guidelines, the following conditions should ideally
be met for any encampment sheltering in place
•
•
•
•

Ability to maintain social distance among encampment residents and from others outside the
encampment
Ability to maintain adequate handwashing and sanitation for a long duration of delayed service
Ability to assess and report suspected infections, meaning either regular access to outreach
workers or to mobile phones with reliable service and electrical power
Ability to maintain adequate food, water and medicine supplies through local stores or service
providers

Encampments or individuals failing to meet these criteria may face severe risk of infection and indirect
consequences in the event of a more severe emergency.

3) Individuals with known or suspected coronavirus infections must be accommodated in private
sleeping and bathing quarters, and such spaces should be made available well in excess of the likely
number of infected individuals

Congregate shelters: Congregate shelters are the predominant form of emergency accommodation
within homelessness assistance systems. Bed densities are often high, and can include bunk beds in
many cases. Per the CDC guidelines18 and FEMA recommendations, 100-110 square feet of space should
be allocated per bed, aligned in head-to-toe formation. For many facilities, this will require a reduction
in bed capacity in a given location, and the establishment of additional offsetting bed capacity
elsewhere to sustain current supply. Consideration should be given to the provision of adequate
hygiene and toilet facilities, and frequent, routine cleaning.
Private accommodations: The ideal scenario would involve private accommodations for all clients.
Private accommodations would dramatically reduce the likely transmission of disease relative to
congregate shelters. The problem lies with the supply and the speed at which options can be mobilized.
In the initial stages of the pandemic, some municipalities have sought to use campers and a variety of
temporary disaster shelters that could be placed in empty areas. This approach is both slow and costly,
and also potentially depends on people moving to isolated areas with open space. More recently, a
number of cities have begun to scale up the use of hotels. Hotels have the advantage of already existing.
Under usual conditions, hotel rooms would be not available. But in the current crisis, the use of hotels
for emergency accommodation offers the added benefit of generating revenue for empty hotels and the
often low-wage workers who operate hotels. Cities such as San Francisco, San Diego and Philadelphia
have already mobilized hotel space for isolate of confirmed or suspected cases. In San Francisco, a group
of city Supervisors have mobilized a more ambitious plan to enroll hotels accounting for 8,500 rooms
into a proposed program, with buy-in from both owners and worker’s unions. This approach may offer a
more scalable alternative to constructing shelters.
Finally, we note that a sizable share of unsheltered individuals live in vehicles, some already parked in
safe parking sites and others scattered throughout cities. Additional safe parking facilities should be
opened, and individuals living in vehicles should be encouraged to move to these locations for safety
and security.
Emergency coordination of care: Regardless of the exact mix of emergency accommodations, the
COVID-19 response would be greatly enhanced by the mobilization of better information and
communication technology, evidence, and disease transmission models. In particular, we recommend
the rapid adoption of SMS/mobile alert systems that would allow a broad spectrum of emergency
outreach activities with relatively simple technologies. Prior research shows that nearly 95% of persons
experiencing homelessness own cell phones and the vast majority make use of text messaging,19 thus
highlighting the feasibility of this approach in terms of reach. We also note some specific advantages of
this approach, all of which would serve both to enhance the reach of existing methods while also
reducing burdens on outreach worker and freeing up their time to support high-need cases:
1) An alert system could remind people of new emergency opportunities as they come onstream, and
allow people to link to location-based maps of the nearest facilities.
2) Alert systems could update both the sheltered and unsheltered of any sudden changes in rules or
procedure, for instance if lockdown restrictions are tightened, eased or reimplemented.
3) For those who remain unsheltered, surveys pushed out over an alert system would serve as a
valuable real-time tool for early detection tool, for monitoring social distancing patterns, and for
delivering hygiene, cleanups and medical care to those who request it.
4) For those moving into emergency accommodations, whether shelters or private rooms, the alert
system could disseminate surveys to monitor social distancing, personal security and threat
perception among those who have received shelter.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a severe and emergent health crisis for the homeless population
across the United States, a crisis that our shelter and health systems are simply not adequately prepared
to meet. The current virus, when scaffolded on top of the already present crisis of aged homelessness,
as well as a myriad of other factors impacting this population, is likely to wreak havoc on this already
highly vulnerable group.
For the 500,000 single adults who experience homelessness on a given night, the current crisis is likely
to cause upwards of 21,000 hospitalizations and 3,400 deaths. Given an annual shelter turnover rate of
at least 3 – meaning that over the course of a year at least three times the PIT-estimate will experience
homelessness and the confined and harsh conditions that come with it, the infection, critical care, and
fatality rates presented here are almost certainly lower bound estimates. Compounding this, we model
these rates and solutions for current (2019) levels of homelessness. While economists are only
beginning to quantify the short-and long-term economic impacts of this pandemic, we are almost
certain to see a recession resulting from the infection itself, resultant social distancing, and general
market uncertainty. Predictions vary widely, but the current record unemployment claims will be
followed by additional housing instability and homelessness that will further stretch an already taxed
homelessness assistance system.
There are limitations to this study that should be noted. We apply homogenous rates of infections,
hospitalizations, critical cases, and mortality across the country, though they will certainly vary by region
and county in ways that we were not able to model. Second, we model those rates based on a single
Point-in-Time estimate of homelessness though, as noted above, households enter and exit
homelessness over the course of a year. Third, this study is notably limited in its scope. It is intended to
model potential infection rates and the capacity required to provide every homeless person safe
accommodation. It is not meant to prescribe the specifics of those facilities, and policymakers and
practitioners are advised to take their cues from research more specifically devoted to that cause, with a
particular emphasis on the aforementioned CDC guidelines and the public health community more
generally.
There are obvious and immediate steps that we can take to mitigate this situation. By creating
adequate and humane accommodations for people living unsheltered, leveraging existing private units
like hotels while creating new ones as feasible, and reconfiguring existing facilities to accommodate
social distancing and isolate symptomatic individuals, lives can be saved. Federal, state and local
governments will need to collaborate around the funding, staffing and siting of facilities. But the
urgency is clear, as is the moral imperative to act.

5) Over time, needs assessments could be adapted to assess whether unsheltered and sheltered
clients have lost access to essential treatments and medicines, in order to avoid indirect
consequences of the pandemic.

remote participation

I would like to thank everyone involved for how much better the March 23 City Council meeting went than the March 16
one. Leaving Zoom on for the entire meeting meant that, when my internet went down, participating by phone allowed
me to follow the meeting as it was happening. Please make that your standard. It really does make it much easier for the
public to see and hear what you're doing while you're doing it, which is an important consideration under the Open
Meeting Law. Not everyone has cable, not everyone has a good computer, and not everyone has reliable internet access,
but lots and lots of us have phones that tend to keep working. Please use all of the means at your disposal to let us
follow along.
It has been heartening to see the many ways this city has responded well to all of the disruption caused by the
pandemic. While there is always more that can be done, what has been done deserves a round of wild applause. Keep
up the good work, remember to be good to yourself and those you love, and wash your hands.

WHEREAS:

On April 26, 2020, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church on 146 Hampshire Street in
Cambridge will be celebrating its 130th anniversary with a special service; and

WHEREAS:

Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church was founded in 1890 when a small group of
believers came together and established what was then known as the Mt. Olive Baptist
Church, and several years later, after a location change that placed the facility closer to
Massachusetts Avenue, the name of the church was changed accordingly; and

WHEREAS:

Since the church’s humble beginnings, Cambridge has grown, changed, and evolved
alongside the country as a whole, with the city and the country undergoing a
transformation from an agrarian-based economy to an industrial-based economy, the
rise of the Information Age, the weathering of one Great Depression and two World
Wars, the Civil Rights Movement, and the dawn of Globalism all transpiring – yet the
mission of Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church has remained a constant, and the
church itself has provided spiritual guidance and nourishment to generations of
Cambridge residents; and

WHEREAS:

Throughout the turbulence, the many civic upheavals, the ever-changing social mores,
and the tugging and tearing of the country’s social fabric at various points throughout
the past 130 years, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church has helped generation after
generation of Cambridge residents find strength, comfort, and spiritual fortitude in
their faith and in their community, and it shall doubtlessly continue on in this mission
for countless generations to come; and

WHEREAS:

In addition to its role as a place of worship, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church –
which is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches, USA – also sees its role as one
of providing stability and building community in Cambridge, as evidenced by the
Project Manna outreach to the displaced and the less fortunate among us, which is led
by Executive Director Rev. Brenda Ann Brown and which offers critical nutritional
assistance to enhance the quality of life, and as evidenced by the monthly Epic
Program, a food pantry that feeds an average of 100 families per month; and

Packet Pg. 124

5.1

WHEREAS:

Even as Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church celebrates this milestone anniversary, it
continues to energize, revitalize, and spiritually nourish Cambridge residents from all
walks of life and is a true pillar of this community; now therefore be it

That the City Council go on record wishing Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church a
Happy 130th Anniversary; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of

WHEREAS:

It is impossible to maintain proper distance from other individuals when talking a walk
or going for a run on narrow Cambridge sidewalks, creating an unsafe situation for
anyone who leaves the home; and

a walk or get some exercise while maintaining recommended social distancing

WHEREAS:

On March 27, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across Massachusetts and the
country, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt ordered that the reservation of the
Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe would be disestablished and its land taken out of federal
trust; and

WHEREAS:

This order was delivered despite ongoing and unresolved litigation over the status of
the Tribe’s land in federal court, defying the independent jurisdiction of the judiciary;
and

WHEREAS:

This is the first order to disestablish a reservation since the federal government’s
colonialist policies of termination and forced assimilation were left behind in the
1960s; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge City Council acknowledges that it governs a municipality on land
stolen from the indigenous peoples of Massachusetts, and therefore has a very basic
responsibility to defend and expand the rights and autonomy of Native Americans in
whichever ways it can; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Council go on record stating its opposition to the Interior Secretary’s
disestablishment of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s reservation, and its solidarity
with the members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Council urges Governor Baker and its legislative delegations to the state
legislature and US Congress to oppose this order by any means at their disposal,
including legal challenges, pursuing options to recognize the Mashpee Wampanoag
Tribe at the state level, and passing new legislation to create a legal framework and
funding mechanisms for Massachusetts’ Native American tribes to continue to hold
their land in autonomy; and be it further

WHEREAS:

On March 23, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker ordered the closure of all non-essential
businesses across Massachusetts for two weeks, forcing many vulnerable small
businesses to close their doors, and resulting in lost revenue for them; and

WHEREAS:

It is estimated that 15,000 stores could permanently close across the country in 2020, a
number significantly higher than the 9,548 stores that permanently closed in 2019,
highlighting just how devastating this lost revenue will be for businesses, particularly
for small businesses that have less savings than larger businesses; and

WHEREAS:

Small business owners often invest their personal savings into their businesses,
indicating possibly severe consequences for small business owners, as they generate
less revenue, and may not have extensive personal savings; and

WHEREAS:

Nevertheless, insurance companies have largely denied business interruption policy
claims, preventing business owners from accessing much-needed and much-deserved
financial relief; and

WHEREAS:

State Senator James Eldridge recently filed SD.2888: An Act Concerning Business
Interruption Insurance; and

WHEREAS:

This legislation would require insurance companies to pay business interruption
policyholders that have experienced an interruption to their business as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, if they have 150 or fewer employees; and

WHEREAS:

The bill would apply to hotels, restaurants, arts organizations, and other businesses that
have been hit hard by this public health crisis, and emphasizes uplifting small
businesses during these challenging times; and

WHEREAS:

Supporting SD.2888 would align with the City Council goal of “[ensuring] that
Cambridge remains an Innovation Hub that integrates businesses of all sizes into a
thriving ecosystem”; now therefore be it

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record in support of SD.2888: An Act Concerning

WHEREAS:

The COVID-19 pandemic and necessary containment protocols implemented to flatten
the curve and keep people safe have resulted in a reduction or elimination of income
for many Cambridge residents; and

WHEREAS:

The necessary closure of businesses, institutions, construction sites, and more has
created financial hardship for many individuals and families; and

WHEREAS:

The necessary closure of schools has required parents to either stay home or spend
money on childcare; and

WHEREAS:

These containment protocols could continue well past the next few weeks and nobody
truly knows when it will be safe to lift them; and

WHEREAS:

Massachusetts housing courts have suspended most eviction proceedings until at least
April 22; and

WHEREAS:

On March 16 alone, there were 19,884 new unemployment claims filed with the state;

impact; now therefore be it
