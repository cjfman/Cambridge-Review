>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, ALL VOTES WILL BE BY ROLL CALL. WE'LL
OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE 14 SPEAKERS. I ASK THAT
YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD AND THE ITEM ON
THE AGENDA THAT YOU SPEAK ON. AND WE'LL START WITH ALAN,
FOLLOWED BY CHRISTOPHER.

Public Comment

>> HI, THANK YOU. I'M ALAN, 24 UNION STREET AND I'M SPEAKING ON
BEHALF OF A BETTER CAMBRIDGE TODAY. A BETTER CAMBRIDGE IS SPEAKING
-- SORRY. IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER FIVE. A BETTER CAMBRIDGE
SUPPORTS POLICY ORDER FIVE TO RAISE LINKAGE FEE FOR COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT OR TO WHATEVER LEVEL IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. WITH
MORE THAN 8 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF -- IT IS CLEAR CAMBRIDGE IS
COMPETITIVE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE PROJECTS IN


PAGE 1

May 25, 2021

KENDALL SQUARE AND ALEWIFE. WE MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON THE
DEVELOPMENTS ON HOUSING COST AND THE LINKAGE FEES. THE PASSED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY TO THE CITY TO
CREATE MORE HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW AND
MODERATE-INCOME RESIDENTS, BUT IT CAN BE ACHIEVED IF THERE IS
AVAILABLE FUNDING. SINCE JUNE 2020, SPACE HAS BEEN PERMIT AND IF THIS
CHANGE WAS PLACED OVER THE -- I'M SORRY.
IF THIS CHANGED PLACED OVER THE PAST YEAR, THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT
AN ADDITIONAL $21 MILLION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE MORE YOU
MOVE, THE MORE EXPEDIENTLY WE CAN USE THE FUNDS TO INCREASE THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT?
>> THANK YOU. SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER FIVE. WHEN THE
DISCUSSION HAPPENED AND WE CAME TO THE TABLE AND SAID WE SHOULD
DO MORE, AND AT THE TIME, THE GOAL WAS TO JUST DISCUSS RAISING THE
LINKAGE FEET AND CONTINUING THE ANNUAL INCREASE THAT WAS
DISCUSSED, WITH PROMISE MORE TO COME. I'M HAPPY THAT TO COME IS
HERE. AND DISAPPOINTED THERE WAS A PANDEMIC IN THE MIDDLE FOR
MULTIPLE REASONS, BUT REALLY APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR WHO BROUGHT IT
FORWARD AND THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU GO THROUGH THE
DISCUSSION. THERE IS OPPORTUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE AND WE HAVE SEEN
THE GREAT DEMAND TO BE IN EAST CAMBRIDGE AND IN ALEWIFE AND OTHER
AREAS LIKE THAT. I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO ALSO CONSIDER
WHETHER THERE IS A NEED OR AN OPPORTUNITY OR A CHOICE TO CONTINUE
TO INCREASE THE COST FOR LARGER BUILDINGS, LARGER DEVELOPMENTS
FROM LARGE COMMERCIAL PARTNERS, WHILE NOT HARMING OR
DISINCENTIVIZING SMALL RETAIL AND SMALL CONSTRUCTION THAT CAN HELP
PROVIDE OTHER BENEFITS TO THE CITY, BUT DOESN'T HAVE THE PROFIT
MARGINS THAT MAY SUPPORT A HIGHER LINKAGE FEE. I'M SURE YOU ARE
SMART AND WILL HAVE THE ADVICE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN THE CITY. I
LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS THE
HOUSING COMMITTEE AND BRING IT BACK AND GET IT DONE AS SOON AS WE
CAN SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY AND MAKE THE CITY BETTER. THANKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JUSTIN, FOLLOWED BY ELAINE.
>> HI, JUSTIN. 215 HURLEY STREET IN EAST CAMBRIDGE. I WOULD LIKE TO
VOICE SUPPORT FOR INCREASING LINKAGE FEES, I HAVE NOTED DIRECTLY IN
PUBLIC COMMENTS IN SEVERAL SETTINGS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPERS SEEKING APPROVALS. LINKAGE FEES ARE TOO LOW TO
AMELIORATE THE IMPACT ON HOUSING COSTS, WHICH IS LEAD TO
DISPLACEMENT. I HAVE ENCOURAGED OTHERS TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT
IN TERMS OF PROPOSED COMMUNITY BENEFITS, THE BETTER SOLUTION IS
FOR THE COUNCIL TO INCREASE LINKAGE FEES DIRECTLY TO AN AMOUNT
THAT IMPACTS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON ADJACENT NEIGHBORS. WE
HAVE DO MANY THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY TO ADDRESS THE SKY-ROCKETING
HOUSING COST. THE COUNCIL CAN DO SOME AROUND ZONING, THERE ARE

PAGE 2

May 25, 2021

THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING COST. INCREASING THE
LINKAGE FEE FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE LINE WITH THOSE
MAKE SENSE AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE IT BROUGHT FORWARD AND SUPPORT
THE ULTIMATE PASSAGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ELAINE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LIKE MANY CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS IN
CAMBRIDGE I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO THE COUNCIL FOR POLICY ORDER
AND RESOLUTION 7 ON THE AGENDA. IN WHICH YOU URGE THE U.S.
CONGRESS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATION TO PREVENT NUCLEAR WAR. AND
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER BRINGING THE RESOLUTION FORWARD TO THE
COUNCIL. AND PEACE GROUPS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE URGING
MAJOR STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE GREAT PERIL THAT WE NOW
FACE FROM NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IT IS NOT ONLY PEACE ACTIVISTS WHO ARE
CALLING OUT THE ALARM AND THE CURRENT ERA, IT IS PEOPLE WHO SERVED
INSIDE GOVERNMENT WHO WONG MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WOULD BE IN
FAVOR OF THE NUCLEAR ARCHITECTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, FORMER DEFENSE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, WILLIAM PERRY, SAID THE CURRENT PERIOD IS
MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTIME DURING THE COLD WAR. SO TO FORMER
SECRETARY OF STATE KISSENGER WAS QUOTED, DUE TO AI AND OTHER
TECHNOLOGY, WE ARE IN MORE DANGER NOW THAN WE HAVE BEEN IN THE
PAST. FOR THAT REASON, I AND MANY OTHERS, ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE
RESOLUTION THAT CALLS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO JOIN THE UN
TREATY ON PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TO ENDORSE THE FIVE
CONCRETE STEPS OUTLINED IN THE BACK OF THE CAMPAIGN. NAMELY TO
RENOUNCE FIRST USE, TO END PRESIDENTIAL SOLE AUTHORITY, AND CANCEL
ADVANCED WEAPONS AND PURSUE GLOBAL TREATIES.
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IS CRUCIAL. TAKE THE
ELIMINATION OF FIRST-USE AND SOLE AUTHORITY. RECENTLY IN THE NEWS,
WE HEARD GENERAL MILIHAD TO ARRANGE THAT A ROGUE LAUNCH ORDER
FROM TRUMP NOT BE ACTED ON. PUTTING A CHECK ON THE PROCEDURES
THAT ARE NOT USUALLY THERE TO PROTECT US. IN THE HISTORY OF
PRESIDENTIAL ACTS SHOWS THERE'S A FEW TIMES WHEN PRESIDENTS HAVE
CONSIDERED FIRST-USE. AND THE VOICE OF CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL
GOING TO CONGRESS AND TO THE WHITE HOUSE IS CRUCIAL AND WILL MAKE
A DIFFERENCE. RIGHT NOW, IN CONGRESS, THERE ARE TWO BILLS
RESTRICTING OR PROHIBITING FIRST USE AND THEY WILL HAVE NO CHANCE
OF PASSING UNLESS CONGRESS HEARS FROM CITIZENS AND THE CITIES. THE
SAME IS TRUE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN, WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF HAVING
HIM RENOUNCE PRESIDENTIAL FIRST-USE IN THE REVIEW. WE KNOW WHEN
HE IS SERVED AS VICE PRESIDENT AND WHEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HE
SPOKE AGAINST OUR POLICY OF PRESIDENTIAL FIRST-USE.
SO, FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE BACK FROM THE BRINK, IS OFFICIALLY
ENDORSED BY CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, LIKE PHILADELPHIA,
WASHINGTON, BALTIMORE, SALT LAKE CITY, LOS ANGELES, AND SAN
FRANCISCO. I'M ALSO PROUD TO BE PART OF CAMBRIDGE TO SAY THIS IS MY


PAGE 3

May 25, 2021

HOME AND ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. WE ARE ALSO
JOINED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
FOR THE RECORD. AND NEXT UP, SUZANNE BILER.
>> THANK YOU. FULLER PLACE AND I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE.
AND AS WELL AS THE AWAITING REPORT ON REDUCING OR ELIMINATING
BUILDING FEES FOR 100% AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT GO BACK TO THE TIME
WHEN COUNSELOR DEVEREUX WAS SEATED THERE AND I ALSO SUPPORT THE
IDEA OF POLICY ORDER 1 AND MORE FRIENDLY HOUSING FOR LGBTQ
RESIDENTS AND HOPING AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WAY TO ADDRESS
COMMUNITY HOUSING AND RELATED THINGS.
AND ON THE BENCH IN HONOR OF A PERSON POLICY ORDER THREE, I'M SURE
THAT HE IS KIND AND I URGE THIS THING, BUT I THINK ABOUT A WAITING
ANTI-BIAS, EQUITY, AND HOPE THE CITY COUNCIL WILL PUT IN PLACE SOME
GOALS SO THAT GOING FORWARD IN THE NEXT TEN, 20, OR 50 YEARS, WE
CAN GET TO PARITY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AND HONORING THEM
THROUGH PARKS AND STREETS AND ALSO MORE MINORITIES.
ON E-CIGARETTES AND VAPING, I SUPPORT THIS, BUT SUGAR CANNABIS,
CONSUMABLES ARE A PROBLEM ALSO. I LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING
THE EVICTION DATA. I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL, BUT WOULD ADD TO IT LEASE
TERMINATION, WHICH IS EQUALLY PROBLEMATIC. PARTICULARLY IN THE
TRANSFER OF RENTAL UNITS. AND ON THE REPORT, ON THE CHA, THAT'S
ALSO -- LOOK AT THE COST OF THE PROJECTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT
TRANSPARENCY. ACQUIRE PROPERTY IN ALEWIFE, IT IS GREAT AND GOES
BACK TO AN EARLIER LEGACY. IT IS A THING WE CAN DO AND WE ALL
APPRECIATE IT. A PART IS DEVELOPMENT AND GETTING MORE AND MORE OF
THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS. WISHING YOU A
LOVELY EVENING AND THANKS FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JAMES COUGHLIN.
>> JAMES AND DAVID HAVE NOT JOINED. NEXT PERSON, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, COUNCILLORS. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT
EFFORT IN RUNNING A REALLY GOOD CITY, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE
DIFFICULT DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC. KUDOS TO YOU FOR DOING A GREAT
JOB. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH RESPECT TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 9.
WAIT STAFF ORDINANCE. IT SERVES MANY PURPOSES WITH RESPECT TO OUR
EMPLOYERS, COMPLETING AGAINST CONTRACTORS WHO PAY UNDER THE
TABLE, CASH TO WORKERS WITHOUT WORKER'S COMP PROTECTIONS, ET
CETERA. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT ALSO, THIS WILL SERVE A BIGGER
PURPOSE. THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR WORKERS IS THE NUMBER ONE--OUR
COMMUNITIES OF IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA,
WHO OFTEN ARE BROUGHT INTO PROJECTS AND ONLY OFFER VERY SMALL
WAGES, BUT NEVER GET TO COLLECT SOMETIMES. CASE IN POINT, WE HAVE
THE HOTEL ON MASS AVENUE, THE JERSEY COLLABORATIVE, WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN PLAYING A ROLE WITH THE CARPENTER'S UNION IN
COLLECTING WAGES. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. IT MAKES SENSE. IT IS THE

PAGE 4

May 25, 2021

RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT SIMPLY AS A RESIDENT OF MASSACHUSETTS
AVENUE, I THINK IT IS JUST A FAIR THING TO DO FOR OUR BUSINESS
COMMUNITY. I WISH YOU A GOOD EVENING AND WISH YOU TO HAVE A SAFE
FALL AND HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MOLLY MCGINTY.
>> HI, MOLLY. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> MOLLY. 33 HANCOCK STREET.
>> MOLLY, IF YOU CAN PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> MOLLY. 33 HANCOCK STREET. I THANK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER
AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR INTRODUCING THE BACK FROM THE BRINK
RESOLUTION. I THANK THE TWO, ALONG WITH THE MAYOR AND
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN FOR SIGNING ON TO AN OPEN LETTER TO
PRESIDENT BIDEN THIS MONTH URGING HIM TO TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO
REDUCE AND ELIMINATE THE DANGER THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSE TO
HUMANITY. I'M A 23-YEAR-OLD CENTRAL SQUARE RESIDENT AND PROGRAM
ASSOCIATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL -- AND I HOPE TODAY WE CAN ADD
CAMBRIDGE TO LIST OF 50 MUNICIPALITIES, SIX STATE LEGISLATIVE BODIES,
AND HAVE ENDORSED BACK FROM THE BRINKS REGARDING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS. REDUCING FIRST-USE, ENDS PRESIDENTIAL SOLE AUTHORITY, AND
TRIGGER ALERT, AND CANCELLING ENHANCED WEAPONS AND PURSUING
GLOBAL ELIMINATION. MANY CRISES, WE HAVE TWO HUMAN MADE
THREATS. ONGOING CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR.
THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE AND CAMBRIDGE IS AT RISK
FOR SEVERE PARTICIPATION, COASTAL STORMS AND HEAT. AND THE
THREATS POSED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE UNKNOWN OR OVERLOOKED.
I'M A GENERATION THAT MISSED THE COLD WAR.
NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSE AN ACUTE THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND
ENVIRONMENT. AND I WILL START WITH A CASE OF A SINGLE CASE
DETONATION OVER A CITY, CAMBRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE. NO ADEQUATE
RESPONSE FROM FIRST RESPONDERS. ONE DESTINATION OVER THE CITY WILL
DECIMATE THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, RUNNING WATER, HOSPITALS,
THEY WILL BE UNSUSTAINABLE. NO MEANINGFUL WAY TO ASSIST THE
ATTACKERS.
LESS THINK 1% OF THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL CAN PUT PEOPLE AT RISK OF
STARVATION. AS TENSIONS AROUND THE WORLD RISE AND THE CLIMATE
CRISIS ACCELERATE, WE ARE AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR WAR. THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE. A WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS POSSIBLE AND IT
STARTS WITH US. BY PASSING THIS, YOU WILL SHOW THE CITIZENS OF
CAMBRIDGE YOU BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE. THE
COUNCIL MUST ACT WITH URGENCY AND TAKE A STAND AGAINST THE
THREAT THAT WEAPONS POSE TO CAMBRIDGE AND AROUND THE WORLD.
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMON FUTURE.

May 25, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES ZALL.
>> THIS IS JAMES, PEMBERTON STREET. ON A SEPARATE TRACK, THIS
COUNCIL HAS STARTED A DISCUSSION ABOUT ENDING THE CITY'S
LONG-STANDING EXCLUSIONARY ZONING PROVISIONS. WHEN THE ZONING
CHANGES EVENTUALLY HAPPEN AND LOWER COST MULTIFAMILY HOUSING IS
ALLOWED, WE'LL NEED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT HOUSING FOR
THE LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE CITY.
SINCE THIS INCREASE IN THE LINKAGE FEE WOULDN'T APPLY TO PROJECTS
ALREADY APPROVED AND UNDERWAY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT THIS
INCREASE IN PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THE CITY CAN COLLECT
MORE FUNDING FOR BADLY-NEEDED HOUSING. I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL
APPROVE THIS MOTION AND MOVE IF FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LEE FERRIS.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, GO AHEAD.
>> I SPEAK TONIGHT FOR THE CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS ALLIANCE, A MEMBER
OF THE NEWLY-ESTABLISHED CAMBRIDGE HOUSING JUSTICE COALITION. AND
I'M SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER NUMBER FIVE TO
INCREASE THE LINKAGE FEE ON NEW LARGE COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION.
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
INCREASING THE LINKAGE FEE FROM THE CURRENT $20 TO $33/34 PER
SQUARE FOOT WILL RAISE TENS OF MILLIONS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT GO
INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST TO PAY FOR LOW, MODERATED, AND
MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING. WE THANK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, FOR TAKING THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS. AND WE ARE WRITING TO
-- OR SPEAKING TO ASK YOU TO STRENGTHEN THE POLICY ORDER IN TWO
WAYS. ONE, THE LINKAGE FEE IS BASED ON THE NEXUS STUDY, WHICH WAS
PREPARED FOR THE MANAGER AND THE COUNCIL IN 2019. AND IT STATED
THAT TO PROVIDE THE FULL SUBSIDY NEEDED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
THAT AMOUNT PER SQUARE FOOT WOULD BE $55.27. AND THE NEXUS
REPORT SAID THAT BECAUSE FEDERAL AND STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
FUNDS CONTRIBUTE TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST, THAT
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS ONLY NEED TO PAY THE $33.34. AND THIS
PROVIDES A DISCOUNT TO COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS, WHICH HAS ALLOWED
THEM TO INCREASE PROFIT WHILE REDUCING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS
GOING INTO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST.
WE ASK THAT THE LINKAGE FEE BE INCREASED NOW TO $33.34 AS A
MINIMUM FLOOR WITH GRADUAL INCREASES OF ROUGHLY $4.40 OVER THE
NEXT FIVE YEARS TO REACH THE FULL $55.27. IT IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE
ENOUGH FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSE. WE ASK THAT SOME PORTION OF
THE INCREASED FEES BE DEDICATED TO SOCIAL HOUSING, A FORM OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT CAMBRIDGE DIDN'T EMPHASIZE. AND THIS
COULD INCLUDE TRADITIONAL FORMS WHERE THE CITY OR OTHER PUBLIC
ENTITY OWNS THE LAND AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. WE DO

PAGE 6

May 25, 2021

NOT CURRENTLY HAVE.
FURTHER, WE THINK THAT IT IS CRUCIAL THAT RESIDENTS OF SOCIAL
HOUSING AND CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS IN GENERAL HAVE A SAY ON WHAT
TYPE OF HOUSING IS BUILT, HOW IT IS RUN AND MAINTAINED. WE LOOK
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COUNCILLORS ON THESE PROPOSALS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE HENRY WORTIS.
>> HI, I'M HENRY, BERKSHIRE STREET. AND I'M WRITING ON BEHALF OF -SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR REVOLUTION... WHICH IS ALSO A MEMBER OF
THE NEWLY-ESTABLISHED CAMBRIDGE HOUSING JUSTICE COALITION. AND AS
THE WHOLE COALITION SAID, WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER
NUMBER FIVE. INCREASES LINKAGE FEES ON LARGE NEW COMMERCIAL
CONSTRUCTION FROM $20 TO JUST OVER $33. THIS IS CRUCIAL FUNDING
FOR NEW HOUSING. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE STATEMENT THAT WE
HAVE ALL SIGNED ON TO. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATURE
OF LINKAGE FEES.
I SAW A COMMENT BY A WELL-KNOWN COMMENTATOR ON CAMBRIDGE
POLITICS WHO TALKED ABOUT IT AS IF IT WERE A TAX OR SOME OTHER SORT
OF PENALTY THAT DEVELOPERS HAVE TO PAY. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE
LINKAGE FEE IS A SUM PAID BY DEVELOPERS TO PAY THE CITY FOR THE COST
OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED.
THERE ARE REAL COSTS AND THE LINKAGE FEE PAYS FOR THEM. AND
THEREFORE, FOR MANY YEARS, THE FACT THAT WE CHARGE THE DEVELOPERS
LESS HAS COST THE CITY'S RESIDENTS AND ALLOWED THE DEVELOPERS TO
POCKET THE DIFFERENCE. SO, WE HOPE THAT THE REST OF THE FEES CAN BE
MADE UP INCREMENTALLY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND THAT THESE
MONIES CAN GO TO SOCIAL HOUSING. THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. I THANK
YOU ALL FOR YOUR ATTENTION. WELL DONE TO THOSE COUNCILLORS WHO
TOOK THE INITIATIVE ON THIS. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I'M WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS? WE ARE MOVING TO MARK
AND THEN HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> MARK HAS NOT JOINED. HEATHER HOFFMAN, GO AHEAD. HEATHER
HOFFMAN, IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET. SO, AS I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE
NATURE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT I'M MAKING RIGHT NOW, I
THOUGHT I WOULD INSERT A ONE SENTENCE PSA FOR YOU. YOU ALL ARE
ELECTED AT LARGE AND REPRESENT ME AND EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO
LIVES IN CAMBRIDGE WHO HAS SPOKEN TONIGHT AND I HOPE YOU
REMEMBER THAT.
IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN. AND I WANT TO THANK
THE PEOPLE WHO TALKED ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND -- I DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE
PROPOSAL FOR LGBTQ+ HOUSING. IT TOOK ME DOWN MEMORY LANE TO


PAGE 7

May 25, 2021

THE LATE '80S. WHEN I WAS A CHARTER MEMBER OF THE MASS LESBIAN AND
GAY BAR ASSOCIATION AND FOUND OUT THAT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
ELAINE, THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED OFFICIAL IN THE UNITED STATES WAS
PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A SECOND -- SHE ALREADY HAD A FIRST ONE IN
MINNEAPOLIS -- GAY-FRIENDLY, INPATIENT DRUG REHAB UNIT.
AND THE PROPOSAL WENT DOWN IN FLAMES. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT TIMES HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN. AND ESPECIALLY I WOULD NOTE
ONE PERSON, WHOSE TESTIMONY AGAINST IT, I REMEMBER REALLY VIVIDLY,
WHO IS ON THE COUNCIL RIGHT NOW, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY. I WOULD SAY,
HE ESPECIALLY HAS SHOWN THE CAPACITY TO GROW AND CHANGE ON THIS.
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO FIND THAT OUT. WITH RESPECT TO LINKAGE FEES.
IT IS SO GRATIFYING TO HEAR ABC AND ITS AFFILIATES ADOPT THE
ARGUMENT THAT HOUSING ACTIVISTS LIKE ME AND SO MANY HAVE MADE
LONGER THAN ABC HAS BEEN AROUND, IT IS GREAT. I HEARD THEM ADOPT
LINES DIRECTLY FROM ME, WITHOUT ATTRIBUTING THEM TO ME, BUT THAT'S
COOL. IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'M RIGHT.
SO, PERHAPS AT SOME POINT, THEY WILL STOP CALLING PEOPLE LIKE ME
ANTI-HOUSING, SINCE I WAS PRO-HOUSING LONG BEFORE THEM. AND I
CONTINUE TO BE SO. AND FINALLY, ONE QUICK WORD ABOUT LAWN
PESTICIDES, WE SHOULDN'T BE GIVING CHILDREN CANCER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE NOW GOING TO JAMES WILLIAMSON,
FOLLOWED BY PETER VALENTINE.
>> THANK YOU. JAMES, JACKSON PLACE AT JEFFERSON PARK IN NORTH
CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU. IS PUBLIC COMMENT ALLOWED ON AN ITEM THAT
IS TABLED? THE RINDGE AVENUE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, YOU CAN SPEAK ON THAT.
>> THANK YOU. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES WITH
THIS STRETCH OF RINDGE AVENUE, WHICH I THINK IS RELEVANT TO THE
ISSUES THAT ARE BEING EXAMINED HERE AND HOPEFULLY HAVEN'T BEEN -THE FINAL DESIGN, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED. THE
IMAGES THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL LAST MONDAY AND I'M
HAPPY TO HAVE LEARNED THAT IT WAS TABLED. I THINK FOR THAT REASON,
SO THERE CAN BE MORE CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF WHAT WOULD BE THE
BEST DESIGN FOR THIS STRETCH. EXCUSE ME.
SOME TIME AGO, ACTUALLY, OVER TEN YEARS AGO, I BEGAN TO TRY TO GET
THE CITY ADMINISTRATION INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE 83
BUS TURNS AROUND IN THE PARK ING LOT RIGHT AT THE CORNER WHERE
THIS PROJECT IS ENVISIONED. THAT BUS HAS BEEN NEARLY TIPPING OVER AS
IT EXISTS THAT PARKING LOT. IT GOES OVER A RAISED SIDEWALK AND
THERE'S A DIVOT IN THE ASPHALT ON THE ORDER SIDE. THE BUS REALLY
NEARLY TIPS OVER. IT IS A VERY WORRYING EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING FOR THE
DRIVERS, WHO FIND IT DISTRESSING.
I JOKE TO THEM, MAYBE WE'LL TIP OVER AND I HOPE THERE'S A LAWYER ON
BOARD. I BROUGHT THIS UP FOR YEARS TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE,


PAGE 8

May 25, 2021

PEOPLE FROM THE MBTA OPERATION HAVE BEEN AT SOME MEETINGS AND
HAVE OBSERVED THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE RAISED SIDEWALK. THERE'S
NOTHING DONE ABOUT IT. HOPEFULLY, IQHQ WILL -- THEY SAID THEY WILL
INCLUDE THIS IN SOME OF WHAT THEY DO. THE IDEA OF INTRODUCING A
TWO-WAY BIKE LANE, I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE -- WHY SOME PEOPLE
WANT THAT. TO DO THAT, THEY ARE TAKING OUT AN EXISTING SIDEWALK,
WHICH I ACTUALLY USE AND QUITE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE USE TO GET FROM
CUOMO FIELD TO THE ALEWIFE BROOK PARKWAY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE
A SIDEWALK THERE AND NOT TO SAY THAT WELL... PEOPLE CAN BE PUSHED
OVER TO A BOARDWALK. THAT ENTAILS A LONGER WALK AND THE
BOARDWALK IS NOT A GREAT IDEA. FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE THIS COUNCIL TO
THINK ABOUT DE-LINKAGE. DE-LINKING DEVELOPMENT FROM BUILDING
HOUSING THAT WE NEED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. PETER VALENTINE?
PETER PRESS THE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM.
>> I HAVE FIVE SENTENCES. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I BELIEVE IN THE CREATOR
OF ALL EXISTENCE. I WON'T ALLOW THE U.S. TO BE DEFEATED. I WON'T
ALLOW THE EARTH TO BE DESTROYED. I BELIEVE EVERY FORM EXIST GOOD
AND BAD. (INAUDIBLE). THEY PROVIDE US WITH EVERYTHING WE NEED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LUKE MCKINNON.
>> THIS IS LUKE. I GOT TO THIS MEETING LATE, I WONDER IS THE WAGE -- IT
SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING ON SOMETHING ELSE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN SPEAK ON THAT. YOU CAN SPEAK ON ANY
ITEM ON THE AGENDA.
>> I WANT TO -- I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE CARPENTER'S UNION WHO
CONNECTED ME TO THEM AND AS A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. AND AS A UNION
CONTRACTOR THAT WORKS IN THE CITY QUITE A BIT. AND WE LOOK FOR YOU
GUYS TO SUPPORT US ALL YOU CAN AND KEEPING THE PLAYING FIELD LEVEL
FOR US AND ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE OUR EMPLOYEES WITH FAIR LIVING
WAGES AND STILL BE ABLE TO SECURE WORK FOR THE CITY AND IN THE CITY.
I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY AND SHOW MY SUPPORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> OKAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ARE DAVID OR MARK BACK YET? OKAY. THAT IS ALL
WHO SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WE CAN MOVE TO CLOSE PUBLIC
COMMENT. ON A MOTION BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE, TO CLOSE PUBLIC
COMMENT, ROLL CALL?

Motion to close public comment

>> MR. CLERK: ON THAT MOTION: (ROLL CALL). MOTION PASSES, EIGHT IN
FAVOR AND ONE ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. MOVING TO
RECONSIDERATIONS. THERE ARE NONE. NO RECORDS FOR SUBMISSION. WE
CAN MOVE TO THE CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA. PLEASURE OF THE CITY

CITY MANAGER AGENDA
ITEM #2 ADOPTED
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of of $5,000
received as a donation from
Stonyfield Farms, Inc. to the
Grant Fund Public Works
Department Other Ordinary
Maintenance account which
will be used toward the costs of
natural turf management
practices by the Department of
Public Works at City parks and
fields.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. IT IS A VERY THRILLING TIME TO VOTE
ON COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS.
BEFORE I DO THAT, LAST MEETING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH MY
MICROPHONE. IS IT ALL SET?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ISSUES AT THE MOMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY. IT IS AN IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF PROJECTS. IT
IS A TOTAL OF 17 POLICE MILLION. 14 MILLION GOING TO ORDER 52ABLE
HOUSING. I HAVE ONE QUESTION, ENSURING THAT ALL CITY GOALS ARE
WORKING TOGETHER AND IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER, WHETHER SOME
OF THE DISCUSSION AT THE MEETING IS ABOUT ANY OF THE FUNDING THAT IS
SPENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRESERVATION OR HISTORICAL
PRESERVATION ENSURES IT IS IN LINE WITH CLIMATE GOALS AND ONLY ALL
ELECTRONIC AND NO NEW GAS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN WHERE POSSIBLE. IT
IS OFTEN ACTUALLY COST-EFFECTIVE TO DO THAT. EVEN IF THERE IS SOME
ADDITIONAL COST UP FRONT THAT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH
ONGOING USE. IT WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING COSTS, PLUS WE KNOW WE
ARE IN THE MIDST OF A CITY THAT HAS SHOWN LEADERSHIP AND SOUGHT TO
CONTINUE TO SHOW LEADERSHIP. I'M CURIOUS IF THAT FACTORS INTO
DECISIONS AND IF NOT, HOW WE CAN MAKE IT SO IT DOES?
>> CITY MANAGER: I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MR. KALE. FROM THE CITY'S
POINT OF VIEW, IT COMES INTO CONSIDERATION AND I DON'T WANT TO
SPEAK IN TERMS OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS IF EVERY PROJECT INDIVIDUALLY IS
-- HOW HIGH THAT PUT THAT INTO THE PRESENTATION. I WILL TURN IT OVER
TO DAVID.
>> DAVID: I THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS YEAR'S LISTING, I THINK SOME
OF THEM FIT INTO THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE
WITH REGARD TO THE BARE ROOT NURSERY AND MAGAZINE BEACH AND
SOME OTHER HISTORICAL PROJECTS, I GUESS. WE ACCEPT PROJECTS THAT
ARE SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC AND THE STAFF. AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE THEORY THAT TAKES IT INTO
ACCOUNT. IT IS LOOKING AT THE PROJECT AND SEEING IF IT IS TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION ONCE THE FUNDING IS SET. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,


PAGE 10

May 25, 2021

WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE REMIND THE
COMMITTEE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I APPRECIATE THAT. TO BE CLEAR, IT IS GREAT TO
SEE THE HISTORICAL PRESERVATION AND OPEN SPACE, ON THE HOUSING
ELEMENT, IN THE MEDIAN TERM IT WILL SAVE COST AND IT LITERALLY SAVES
LIFE. IT IS EMERGING RESEARCH THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION, GAS STOVES ARE
HARMFUL TO PEOPLE. WE SHOULD BE HAVING ELECTRONIC STOVES FOR
EVERYBODY, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE TRUST HOPEFULLY IS TAKING THAT
INTO ACCOUNT. EVERY PROJECT IN THAT AREA TO ENSURE WE WILL
HEARING TOMORROW AND OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS THE
IDEA OF THE CITY ITSELF GETTING ON A PATH TO ACTUALLY MEET THE STATE
LAW AND THAT REALLY WILL REQUIRE ZERO NEW FOSSIL FEW
INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS IN THE CONTEXT, NOT JUST OF WHAT YOU MAY
THINK OF USUAL SUSPECT, BUT IN TERMS OF HOUSING. I KNOW WE WANT
TO BUILD AS MUCH HOUSING, AND I KNOW THE ECONOMICS ARE SUCH THAT
GIVEN THERE'S OPERATING COSTS, IT IS NOT MORE EXPENSIVE NECESSARILY
TO DO THIS. I'M URGING US, IF WE ARE NOT ALREADY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT,
EVERY PROJECT BE REVIEWED WITH THAT IN MIND AND DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO PUSH BACK AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS AT RISK AS WELL.
>> CITY MANAGER: I THINK THE NEXT MEETING IS WEDNESDAY. I'M NOT
SURE IF THAT MEETING, I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE -- THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST HEARS YOUR COMMENTS AND MAKE SURE WE
HAVE A DISCUSSION ON IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO CONQUER
WITH COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I THOUGHT THE COMMENTS WERE RIGHT ON
TARGET AND APPRECIATE THE MANAGER'S RESPONSE. I DID WANT TO PAY A
COMPLIMENT AND WHEN I BELIEVE IT WAS THE LAST MEETING OR THE
MEETING BEFORE, MUST HAVE THE BEEN THE LAST MEETING, I MENTIONED
IT IS IMPORTANT IN THE BUDGET OR WHEN WE ARE APPROVING SMALL
GRANTS TO HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THE BIGGER BUDGET ITEM IS FOR THE YEAR.
WE HAVE A SENSE AND WHAT I WANT TO COMPLIMENT IS THIS REPORT DOES
THAT. IT JUST DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR, IT GIVES US APPROXIMATELY
A 20-YEAR OVERVIEW AND SOMETIMES EVEN BROADER THAN THAT.
I KNOW OUR DISCUSSIONS SOMETIMES MIGHT BE WHAT IS WRONG, BUT
THAT HELPS ENORMOUSLY IN UNDERSTANDING THE BIG PICTURE. SO THANK
YOU FOR THAT.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK DAVID AND THE WHOLE
TEAM, THIS DOCUMENT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT. IT IS INCREDIBLY
INFORMATIVE AND I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES GIVE A

MILLION. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY IT IS 32.3 MILLION. 140% INCREASE AND I
THANK THE COUNCIL FOR URGING US TO GET HERE. IT IS SOMETHING WE

May 25, 2021

THIS YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU ALL.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: WHEN WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR, WE TYPICALLY
MOVE SUSPENSION TO MOVE CONSIDERATION HOPING THE SAME WILL NOT
PREVAIL SO THE MONEY CAN BE ALLOCATED RIGHT AWAY. I'D LIKE TO DO
THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE MOTION.
>> MR. CLERK: TWO VOTES. FIRST ONE IS ON SUSPENSION OF THE RULES
THAT WILL ALLOW THE BODY TO GO TO RECONSIDERATION. A YES VOTE WILL
ALLOW THE COUNCIL TO GO TO RECONSIDERATION. NO VOTE WILL STOP
THAT ACTION -- WON'T ALLOW THAT. AND IF THE COUNCIL VOTES TO GO TO
RECONSIDERATION, VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW THE -- I'M SORRY.
FINALIZE THE ITEMS TONIGHT OR ALLOW IT TO STAY OPEN UNTIL MONDAY.
YES VOTE IS A-- EXCUSE ME, UNTIL WEDNESDAY. NO VOTE, WILL FINALIZE ALL
ITEMS TONIGHT. ON RECONSIDERATION:

Motion to Suspend the Rules
for Reconsideration of City
Manager’s Agenda Item #1
vote

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: MOVE SUSPENSION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON SUSPENSION OF THE RULES TO MOVE TO
RECONSIDERATION. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
NEXT VOTE IS ON RECONSIDERATION. AGAIN, A YES VOTE WILL ALLOW
THINGS TO STAY OPEN FOR RECONSIDERATION UNTIL WEDNESDAY. AND A

Reconsideration of City
Manager’s Agenda Item #1

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE DID NOT PULL ITEM TWO. WE'LL GO
TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM THREE. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM
NUMBER THREE).
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANKS. GREAT TO SEE THIS ON THE
AGENDA. I HAVE SEEN THE NEW DATA, I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THE
SITES FOR THE LOCATION ARE CHOSEN. AND IF IT IS THROUGH THE
BLUEBIKES DATA AND IF THERE CAN BE MORE INFORMATION PROVIDED
THERE?
>> SURE. EXCUSE ME. GENERALLY, THEY ARE SELECTED BASED ON USER
DEMAND AND LOCATION WHERE PEOPLE ASK FOR ADDITIONAL BLUEBIKE
STATIONS. I THINK GENERALLY BASED ON WHAT THE USERS LOOK FOR AND
ALSO DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
STATIONS TO EXIST IN DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS. ONE OF THE
CHALLENGES WITH BLUEBIKES, MANY STATIONS ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE
STATIONS IN OTHER LOCATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH OUTSIDE FUNDING, IT
IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FILL THE NETWORK. LOCATIONS THAT ON THE LIST
ARE -- ON THIS APPROPRIATIONS ARE LOCATIONS ASKED FOR BY THE
COMMUNITY THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVE NOT BEEN INSTALLED, PARTICULARLY
IN THE CASE NEAR RAYMOND PARK, ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO INSTALL A


PAGE 14

May 25, 2021

CURB ATTENTION TO HOUSE THE BLUEBIKE STATION.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THAT'S HELPFUL. I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: QUESTIONS? COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THIS IS REALLY GREAT TO SEE THE
ONGOING EXPANSION OF BLUEBIKES. THERE DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE MORE
UTILIZATION AND I WAS READING A REPORT FROM JULY THAT SHOWED WE
INDEED ARE SETTING NEW RECORDS, WHICH IS REALLY GREAT TO SEE.
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE GAUGE WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH
SUPPLY AND WHETHER OUR STATIONS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE? WHEN I
LOOKED ON THE APP AROUND 1:00 THIS AFTERNOON, ALL THE STATIONS IN
CENTRAL SQUARE WERE AT OR NEAR ZERO. THEY ARE NOW REPLENISHED.
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GOOD BALANCE ACROSS THE CITY.
>> I WOULD PROBABLY DEFER SOME QUESTIONS TO STAFF FROM
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WILL GET MORE INVOLVED IN THE SPECIFIC
DETAILS. I THINK ONE GENERAL OBSERVATION AND TODAY WAS A GREAT
DAY FOR BIKING GIVEN THE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. ONE THING WE
FOUND, PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE SQUARES, IT IS VERY HARD TO KEEP
UP WITH DEMAND, GIVEN THE POPULARITY OF THE SYSTEM, WHICH IS A
GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE, BUT SOMETHING TO WORK ON AND BOTH A
QUESTION OF HAVING THE STATIONS, BUT EVEN MORE SO FINDING
LOCATIONS TO PLACE THEM, GIVEN HOW BUSY THE SIDEWALKS ARE. WE
MOVED TO YEAR-ROUND OPERATIONS. THAT MEANS THE STATIONS NEED TO
BE LOCATED NOT IN THE STREET LIKE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY. BUT ON A
CURB EXTENSION OR WHERE THEY ARE PROTECTED FOR SNOW CLEARANCE
AND STREET MAINTENANCE. WE TRY TO BE DILIGENT ABOUT MOVING THEM
TO THE LOCATIONS, BUT I THINK IT IS A ONGOING STRUGGLE. WHERE WE
ARE WITH DEMAND VERSUS SUPPLY, I CAN ASK COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION, IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WOULD AGREE. SUZANN HAS BEEN ON THE PROJECT
SINCE DAY ONE AND A KEY VOICE TO MAKE SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST
SAID SO WE CAN HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH HER AND GET MORE
INFORMATION. I KNOW IT IS SOMETHING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
WORKED HARD TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. WHEN YOU ASKED FOR MORE
INFORMATION FROM CDD, I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT ELECTRONIC BIKE
-- ELECTRIC BIKES AND WHERE WE WITH INCLUDING THEM IN THE BLUEBIKES
PROGRAM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. A QUICK QUESTION. I BELIEVE IT
WAS THE DIRECTOR OF TRAFFIC AND PARKING THAT SAID SOMETHING TO
THE EFFECT ABOUT BIKING DEMAND, WHICH I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WE ARE
RISING TO MEET THE DEMAND. I JUST WANT TO ASK A QUESTION WHEN YOU
SAID BIKING DEMAND. AND THE PLACEMENT, SPECIFICALLY TO -- I DON'T
HAVE IT OPEN NOW. NOT THE RAYMOND STREET, THE OTHER LOCATION.


PAGE 15

May 25, 2021

SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE PUT UP -- THEY WERE WANT BLUEBIKE,
THERE WAS ANOTHER TYPE OF BIKE, THE COMMUNITY GOT A LITTLE
DISTURBED BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE THEY DIDN'T HAVE PROPER NOTICE. I
WANT TO BE SURE WE DID PROPERLY NOTICE THE COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU
SAY RIDER DEMAND, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD ASSUME THAT MEANS FROM
THE NEIGHBORHOOD DEMAND OR FROM THE USER PERSPECTIVE. WE WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY ARE PLACED IS
ALSO AWARE OF THE PLACEMENT AND THE EXECUTION AND
IMPLEMENTATION SO THEY ARE NOT TAKEN BY SURPRISE.
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHEN YOU SAID DEMAND, WAS IT JUST
BASICALLY USER DEMAND? OR IS IT MORE THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAID YES
SOMETHING -- CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT PROCESS. I WANT TO BE
SURE WE ARE DOING BOTH/AND. MEETING THE RIDERSHIP NEED WITH THE
NEIGHBORHOOD NEED.
>> TWO THOUGHTS ON THAT. ONE, IN THE CASE OF A RESIDENTIAL
LOCATION, LIKE THESE, THE RIDERSHIP DEMAND IS ALSO THE RESIDENTIAL
DEMAND. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO/FROM THE LOCATIONS IS ONE END OF THE
TRIP RESIDENT. THE FACT THAT WE SEE THE DEMAND AT THE LOCATIONS
DOES GENERALLY INDICATE THE NEIGHBORHOODS, AT LEAST THE FOLKS WHO
ARE BLUEBIKE MEMBERS AND USERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, ARE LOOKING
FOR THOSE STATIONS TO BE THERE. IN ADDITION TO THAT, IN THIS CASE
SPECIFICALLY, WE'LL BE DOING -- WE HAVE THIS GRANT AND WE NEED TO
APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS BEFORE THE BIKES ARE INSTALLED OR STATIONS,
WE'LL DO ADDITIONAL OUTREACH TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. TO YOUR
POINT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE AWARE THEY ARE COMING AND IF THERE
ARE ANY CONCERNS, THEY ARE ADDRESSED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK PRETTY MUCH WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE KEEPING UP WITH RIDER DEMAND, BUT
ALSO MAKE SURE WE KEEP UP WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DON'T WANT
THEM TO BE SURPRISED THAT -- YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING, YOU HAVE A
BIKE STATION AND YOU DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH YOU HAVE PROPER NOTICE.
IT IS REALLY ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS FEELING THEY ARE
PROPERLY NOTIFIED AND IF THEY WANT TO WEIGH IN, HAVING THE
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. THANK YOU. I WANTED TO BE SURE WE WERE
DOING THE BOTH/AND. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS
MATTER, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE APPROPRIATION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER
FOUR. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER FOUR).
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I'M GLAD TO SEE IT IS MOVING
ALONG. I KNOW I ASKED ABOUT IT IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST TO SEE
WHERE WE WERE. EVERYBODY IS CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO GET THAT
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED AND RUNNING. I WONDER IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN

THE CHANGE FROM THE STATE HOUSE COUNCIL AND MOVING AND STRIKING
THIS LANGUAGE. WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN THE
POLICE CADET HOME RULE PETITION AND NOW IS SUBSEQUENTLY BEING
TAKEN OUT ON ADVICE FROM THE STATE HOUSE COUNSEL.
>> NOT EXACTLY PURSUANT TO ADVICE FROM HOUSE COUNSEL. THEY ASKED
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION, WHICH INCLUDED
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS SECTION. WE REALIZED AT THE TIME, THIS WAS A
HOLD-OVER FROM THE POLICE CADET LEGISLATION THAT WAS SUBMITTED
PREVIOUSLY AND APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND RELATED TO A
CONSENT DECREE THAT THE CITY WAS SUBJECT TO IN THE CASTRO VERSUS
BEECHER CASE, WHICH RELATED TO -- PERHAPS SHEILA CAN ADDRESS THAT
MORE SPECIFICALLY. THAT HAS SINCE BEEN REVOKED AND NO LONGER
APPLICABLE. WE REALIZED AT THE TIME WHEN THEY SENT US THE
QUESTIONS THAT IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO SIMPLY REMOVE THE
SECTION FROM THE PETITION BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER APPLICABLE IN
CAMBRIDGE.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. SINCE WE PUT IN THE POLICE CADET
HOME RULE PETITION MANY YEARS AGO, SUBSEQUENTLY THERE WAS
ANOTHER CASE THAT SETTLED THIS AND WE DON'T NEED THE LANGUAGE
ANYMORE AND THE FIRE CADET HOME RULE PETITION. IS THAT RIGHT? YOU
DON'T HAVE TO GET SUPER TECHNICAL.
>> YES.
>> CITY MANAGER: THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SUMMARIZE IT.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WE SENT THIS IN FEBRUARY TO THE
STATE HOUSE. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS THAT HAPPEN NOW
ONCE WE APPROVED THIS. DO WE SEND IT BACK TO THE STATE HOUSE
COUNSEL AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
>> I CONFERRED WITH THE CITY CLERK. HE AND I BOTH BELIEVE IT CAN GO
DIRECTLY BACK TO REPRESENTATIVE DECKER'S OFFICE, WHERE IT WAS IN THE
PROCESS WHEN THE QUESTIONS WERE SENT TO US FROM DECKER THROUGH
HOUSE COUNSEL. WE SEND IT BACK TO HER OFFICE AND SHE PROCEEDS TO
TRY TO PUSH IT THROUGH THE DIFFERENT STAGES THAT IT NEEDS TO GO
THROUGH. I THINK WE DON'T LOSE ANY ADDITIONAL TIME AT THIS POINT
ONCE IT IS FINAL AND VOTED UPON BY THE COUNCIL.
>> CITY MANAGER: REPRESENTATIVE DECKER KNOWS THIS IS ON TONIGHT
AND WE'LL GET IT TO HER QUICKLY. WE WANT TO DO THIS AND WE KNOW
THE COUNCIL DOES. THERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE THIS
PROGRAM HAPPEN. WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I DO HOPE WE CAN GET THIS DONE
SOON. I'M GLAD IT IS GOING BACK TO REPRESENTATIVE DECKER'S OFFICE
AND NOT BACK TO THE COUNSEL AND THEN TO HER. I KNOW THE
CAMBRIDGE FIRE TEAM IS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRAM THEY ARE
PUTTING TOGETHER. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS ALMOST FULLY PUT TOGETHER.
WE HAVE $2 MILLION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE HAD A CLASS OF FIRE


PAGE 17

May 25, 2021

FIGHTERS THAT WAS NOT AS DIVERSE AS WE WERE HOPING THAT THE FIRE
CADET PROGRAM COULD HELP US WITH. I KNOW THAT COUNCILLOR
TOOMEY, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, WE HAVE
BEEN PUSHING FOR THIS PROGRAM AS WE WERE EAGER TO BUILD ON THAT
SUCCESS OF THE POLICE CADET PROGRAM AND PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY JOBS
TO OUR KIDS AND I'M VERY EXCITED THAT WE ARE MOVING THIS FORWARD.
AND IT WILL GO RIGHT TO REPRESENTATIVE DECKER AND MY LAST QUESTION
IS...
THE CLERK GOING TO BE THE ONE THAT IS THE LIAISON BETWEEN THE
COUNCIL FIGURING OUT -- I LIKE TO KEEP UPDATED ON WHERE THIS IS.
>> MR. CLERK: I BELIEVE COMMUNICATION WILL HAPPEN THROUGH THE CITY
MANAGER'S OFFICE. I DO GET QUESTIONS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE'S
OFFICE, BUT I BELIEVE THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE GETS MORE UPDATES.
>> CITY MANAGER: WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE UPDATES. WE ALSO WANT TO
FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY. I THANK VICE-MAYOR MALLON FOR RECOGNIZING
THE UNION. KEY SUPPORTERS IN THIS FROM DAY ONE AND PLAYED A KEY
ROLE IN HELPING THIS MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR VICE-MAYOR
MALLON AND EVERYBODY ON THE PRIOR COUNCILS WHO BROUGHT THIS
FORWARD AND MADE IT HAPPEN. AND THE POLICE CADET PROGRAM IS
TERRIFIC. I KNOW ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR DOING THIS IS TO
DIVERSIFY THE FORCE AND ENSURE WE HIRE THE BEST. AND I KNOW ALSO
TIED TO THIS AND PART OF THE REASON I BROUGHT FORTH THE ORDER TO
LOOK AT AND UNDERSTAND IF WE STICK WITH CIVIL SERVICE, 15 MONTHS
AGO, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET A REPORT A YEAR AGO, THAT'S ANOTHER
WAY TO LOOK AT IF THE COUNCIL CHOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN
APPROACH THAT ALLOW US AND THE COMMISSIONERS OF VARIOUS
DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO HIRE A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE. I'M NOT
SURE WHERE IT IS. I'M THRILLED WITH THIS PROGRAM, IT WOULD BE
TERRIFIC TO HAVE ALL TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL, IT IS NOW MORE THAN A
YEAR OVERDUE FOR A REPORT. I WANTED TO MAKE A STATEMENT. I THINK
IT IS A REALLY GOOD IMPORTANT AND GOOD GOVERNANCE MOVE TO GO
FORWARD AND LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS TO ENFORCE THE POWERS TO BE AS
DIVERSE ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS ON THE HOME RULE
LEGISLATION? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, WE'LL HEAR FROM THE SOLICITOR
FIRST.
>> I WANT TO NOTE, IF THE COUNCIL WANTS TO GET THIS TO THE
REPRESENTATIVE'S OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THE COUNCIL MAY WISH TO
CONSIDER INTRODUCING A MOTION RECONSIDERATION AND HOPING THE
SAME WILL NOT PREVAIL.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THE SOLICITOR KIND OF STOLE MY
THUNDER ON THE MOVEMENT FOR RECONSIDERATION. I WANT TO THANK


PAGE 18

May 25, 2021

VICE-MAYOR MALLON AND MY COLLEAGUES THAT STOOD TO MAKE THIS
HAPPEN AND MOVE IT FORWARD. ON THE SUBJECT OF CIVIL SERVICE, PRIOR
COUNCILS WORKED VERY HARD TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND WAYS TO GET
AROUND THE IMPEDIMENT OF CIVIL SERVICES AS EARLY OR AS FAR AS BACK
AS COMMISSIONER HAUS ON THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M VERY HAPPY
THAT WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD WHILE THE
STATE GETS -- MAKES UP ITS MIND OR MAKES THE REQUISITE CHANGES SO
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY OR BOGGED DOWN BY CIVIL SERVICE.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS TO SEE THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. I'M VERY
PLEASED. I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE ORDER. I WILL CONTINUE TO DO
THE WORK THAT I AND OTHERS AND OTHER COUNCILLORS BEFORE THIS
COUNCIL, THEIR EFFORTS TO SEE HOW WE CAN HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE
CIVIL SERVICE, BUT IN THE PLACEMENT OR UNTIL THAT TIME, I THINK WHERE
WE ARE IS EXTRAORDINARY AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE IT MOVING
FORWARD. IF THERE'S NO FURTHER DISCUSSION, NOT ONLY CAN WE VOTE
TO ACCEPT THIS, BUT ALSO MOVE RECONSIDERATION SO THAT WE CAN
MOVE THIS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.

THE MOTION.

Councillor Nolan motion for

PAGE 19

May 25, 2021

WOULD PASS. AND WE HAVE A MINOR CLERICAL ERROR THAT WE PROPOSE
FOR THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT, WHICH IS TO SIMPLY PUT IN NUMBER THREE, IF
NUMBER THREE PASSES, A NEW SECTION, 116-B, WOULD BE ADDED. OR IF
QUESTION TWO FAILS, IT WOULD BE A NEW SECTION, 116-A. IT ALLOWS FOR
THE POSSIBILITY THAT QUESTION 2 MAY OR MAY NOT BE PASSED OR
APPROVED BY THE VOTERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS, SOLICITOR. I WILL ENTERTAIN THE MOTION,
PER THE CLERK, TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT HEADING. IT SAYS NOVEMBER 3.
WE'LL CHANGE THAT TO NOVEMBER 2ND FOR THE ELECTION DAY.
ANYWHERE IT SAYS NOVEMBER 3RD, WE CORRECT IT TO BE NOVEMBER 2ND.
ARE THERE QUESTIONS ON THIS MEMO PREPARED TO US BY THE CITY
SOLICITOR? I DON'T THINK WE DO.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WILL MAKE A COMMENT. I APPRECIATE AND THE
COUNCIL SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AFTER THE CONVERSATION LAST WEEK
ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE VOTERS WOULD GET THE EXACT TEXT OF THE
ACTUAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE PROPOSED CHANGE ON THE BALLOTS,
THE CITY SOLICITOR WORKED WITH THE ELECTION COMMISSION TO ENSURE
IT WOULD BE. YOU SEE THAT BEFORE YOU ON THE MEMOS. IN ADDITION, AS
DIRECTED BY YOU, THE MAYOR AND I HAVE WORKED ON AN ARGUMENT
WHICH WE FORWARDED TO THE ELECTION COMMISSION. THAT'S THE ONLY
COMMENT RELATED TO THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE CITY SOLICITOR PICKING
UP ON THIS CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED.

AMEND THE ELECTION DATE FROM NOVEMBER 3RD TO NOVEMBER 2ND.

BUT IT WAS FINE YOU VOTED.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: DO WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THE OTHER CHANGE.
THE CHANGE IF QUESTION TWO FAILS, BY ADDING A NEW SECTION -- I'M NOT

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 1. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 1). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I HAVE MADE SEVERAL OR
NUMEROUS CONCERTED EFFORTS TO STEER THE CITY TOWARD EXPLORING
THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING OR THE VERY LEAST ENABLING THE CREATION
OF HOUSING GEARED TOWARD THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THIS ORDER IS AN
ATTEMPT TO SUMMARIZE THE PAST EFFORTS AND REQUEST WE NOT ONLY
RETRACE THE STEPS ON THE PROCESS, BUT START LAYING THE GROUNDWORK
FOR A NEW EFFORT ON THIS FRONT. UNFORTUNATELY, AS WE SAW DURING
THE DARK YEARS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITH A SHARP
RIGHT-WING SHIFT OF THE SUPREME COURT, THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND
LIBERTIES THAT MANY HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE, IN AN
EVER-FLUID STATE BECAUSE WE WON THE RIGHTS, JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE
THEM NOW, WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT SAFEGUARDED AGAINST THE
NOTION THAT AT SOME POINT, SOMEONE MAY TRY TO ARREST THEM AWAY
FROM US. WE SEE IT WITH THE CHIPPING AWAY OF ROE V. WEIGHED IN
TEXAS. THIS IS TO SAY, THERE'S VERY MUCH NEED AND DESIRE TO CURATE
THE HOUSING THAT CAN INDEED CULTIVATE THE COMMUNITY ASPECT OF
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THIS IS SOMETHING OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE


PAGE 22

May 25, 2021

MANAGE TO CRACK THE CODE ON AND IF CAMBRIDGE CAN'T BE THE LEADING
THE CHARGE, I WANT US TO AT LEAST BE PART OF THE OVERALL EFFORT. I
HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT ME ON THIS. ONE THING IS,
IMPORTANT TO NOTE, THE CITY OF BOSTON HAS MOVED FORWARD ON
DOING THIS AND I KNOW THAT WE STARTED THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE
SAME TIME THE CITY OF BOSTON STARTED THE CONVERSATION AGAIN.
I REALIZE IT IS NOT EASY, IT IS DIFFICULT, BUT I THINK IT IS NEEDED IN A PLACE
WHERE A SAFE HARBOR, IT IS WHAT WE WERE CALLING IT YEARS AGO. SAFE
HARBOR, FOR THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY, AND THE TRANSGENDER BROTHERS
AND SISTERS, WE FIND IT INCREASINGLY HARD TO FIND SAFE PLACES TO
RESIDE. I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE EXPLORE AND TRY TO
REALLY DEVELOP THIS TYPE OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY, IF NOT
CAMBRIDGE, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I PUT THIS FORWARD. I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL SUPPORT THIS
IDEA, THIS INITIATIVE, AND I HOPE THAT THE CITY MANAGER WILL WORK TO
PASS VERY QUICKLY AT BRINGING BACK INFORMATION AS TO NOT ONLY
WHAT ARE THE IMPEDIMENTS, BUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO GO FORWARD. I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO REALLY
THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ORDER
FORWARD. AS IT HAPPENS, MY OFFICE DID A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE
OVER THE SUMMER. I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF WHAT WE LEARNED, BOTH
IN TERMS OF THE URGENT NEED FOR LGBTQ+ FRIENDLY HOUSING OPTIONS,
AS WELL AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE FROM AROUND THE
COUNTRY. AND IN TERMS OF THE NEED, SENIORS ARE IMPACTED BY DECADES
OF OPPRESSION AND FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING DISRUPTED
CONNECTION TO FAMILIES OF ORIGIN, DISCRIMINATION, AND LESS
OPPORTUNITY TO AGE IN A SECURE LOCATION. AND THESE CHALLENGES AND
MORE PUT THIS POPULATION AT GREATER RISK FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS,
MENTAL ILLNESS, ADDICTION, AND MORE. THIS IS SPECIALLY COMPOUNDED
FOR LGBTQ SENIORS OF COLOR AND THOSE THAT IDENTIFY AS TRANS OR
BISEXUAL. THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN RESEARCH CONDUCTED
SPECIFICALLY HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS, AS WELL AS NATIONALLY.
ONE RECENT SURVEY ABOUT LGBT SENIORS IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES,
22% RESPONDENTS FELT THEY COULD BE OPEN ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY WITH
FACULTY FACILITY STAFF AND 89% PREDICTED THE STAFF WOULD
DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY.
26% OF TRANSGENDER SENIORS THAT EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WITHIN
THE LAST YEAR REPORTED WAVING A SHELTER OPTION BECAUSE THEY FEAR
BEING MISTREATED. AND THE POPULATION IS ESTIMATED ABOUT 3 MILLION
PEOPLE AND CHOOSE EXPECTED TO GROW TO 7 MILLION BY 2030. AND
GIVEN THIS, THERE'S EFFORT TO COUPLE LGBT AFFIRM HOUSING WITH CULT
REALLY COMPETENT SERVICES TO CHART A NEW COURSE FOR THE
VULNERABLE POPULATION.


PAGE 23

May 25, 2021

AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS WORKED AROUND THE COUNTRY,
SOME PATTERNS DO EMERGE. EVEN THOUGH WE CANNOT RESTRICT THE
HOUSING SPECIFICALLY TO LGBT PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT,
SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE REMARKABLE PERCENTAGES OF LGBT RESIDENTS,
INCLUDING THE TRIANGLE APARTMENTS IN L.A., JUST 65% OF LGBT. AND
THESE APARTMENTS TYPICALLY CATER TO LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS AND
INCLUDE COMBINATION OF SUPPORTIVE HEALTHCARE, FITNESS, AND SOCIAL
SERVICES THAT ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND LGBT FRIENDLY. AND AS
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS MENTIONED ONE SUCH PROJECT HAS BROKEN
GROUND IN BOSTON AND I DO THINK CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE NEXT.
I'M EXCITED THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS HAS BROUGHT THIS FORWARD.
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER TO CONTINUE THIS
IMPORTANT WORK UNTIL THE DAY COMES WHEN WE CAN PROUDLY OPEN A
LGBT-FRIENDLY HOUSING OPTION IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, FOR ALL YOUR
WORK OVER THE PAST DECADE ON THIS MATTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO
SEEING THE NEXT STEPS ON THIS. I SEE NO OTHER HANDS, ROLL CALL ON
ADOPTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 4). WE'LL GO TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON, WHO
PULLED IT?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. LAST WEEK WE HAD A COVID UPDATE
WITH THE CITY MANAGER, WHERE WE ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT WE LOOK
FOR TO REMOVE THE MASK MANDATE. METRIC, VACCINATION RATES,
APPROVAL FOR 5-11-YEAR-OLD. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF
CONSENSUS AND SOME RESIDENTS HAVE CONCERNS AROUND NOT HAVING
ANY METRICS OR STATED GOALS. AND A DESIRE TO HAVE THE METRICS
DEFINED TO HAVE A GOAL TO WORK TOWARD AND HAVE TRANSPARENCY
AROUND DECISIONS. I KNOW IN AUGUST, THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE DURING
THEIR INDOOR MANDATE VOTED THAT THEY WOULD INSTITUTE THE INDOOR
MASK MANDATE AND RELOOK AT THE DECISION AND POLICY IN JANUARY.
THE CITY'S INDOOR MASK MANDATES DOESN'T MENTION METRICS OR TIME
FRAME AND PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE LOOK AT TO REMOVE
THIS. POLICY ORDER, AND THANK YOU COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR PUTTING IT
IN, AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI, FOR SUPPORTING IT. I THINK IT IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT STEP FOR US TO THINK ABOUT AS A CITY. WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE TO HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY TO STATE METRICS AND GOALS SO
EVERYBODY IS REALLY CLEAR. I HEARD FROM A LOT OF RESIDENTS, WE ARE
LOCKED DOWN, WE WEAR MASKS, WE GOT OUR VACCINATIONS, AND NOW IT
JUST SEEMS LIKE WE ARE NOT WORKING TOWARDS ANYTHING. IT FEELS
ENDLESS FOR A LOT OF RESIDENTS. JUST HAVING A METRIC OR STATED
GOALS WILL REALLY HELP PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR A LOT OF RESIDENTS WHO
STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW WITH THIS PANDEMIC. THIS IS JUST ASKING THE CITY
MANAGER AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM TO THINK ABOUT PUTTING
TOGETHER METRICS OR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO. I HOPE THAT OUR

PAGE 24

POLICY ORDER #1
ADOPTED
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to direct
the Community Development
Department, the City Solicitor,
and other appropriate City
staff to compile a report
detailing the efforts the City
has made toward creating
LGBTQ+-Friendly Housing
over the past decade, to state
what impediments had been
identified in realizing this
effort, and to outline
recommendations for how the
City may successfully create
such housing within the next
three years

May 25, 2021

COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US IN SUPPORTING THIS ORDER TONIGHT. THANK
YOU, I YIELD BACK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, VICE-MAYOR MALLON,
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN WORKING ON THIS AND REALLY WANTING THIS TO
MOVE FORWARD. I AM WEARING A MASK FROM EFFORTS OF PARENTS
THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT, WHO HAVE REALLY BANDED TOGETHER TO TRY
TO PROVIDE SOME HIGH-FITTING, 95% EFFICIENT MASKS. I POINT THAT OUT
BECAUSE IT IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CELEBRATE THE
COMMUNITY DOING THIS AND YET IT IS TOO BAD THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD
TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE SOME OF THIS WITHOUT AS MUCH SUPPORT FROM
THE CITY. AND AS VICE-MAYOR MALLON NOTED, THIS DECISION WILL BE
MADE ON METRICS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. LET'S MAKE SURE IT
IS AS TRANSPARENT AND WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO AIM FOR. IF WE
KNOW, AS IT WAS WITH THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT, AND MAYOR SIDDIQUI
HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH, YOU SET THE GOAL AND THEN EVERYBODY
KNOWS WHEN IT IS. IF YOU GET CLOSE, YOU CAN KEEP DOING WHAT YOU
ARE DOING AND WORK TOWARDS IT. I HOPE THIS CITY ADMINISTRATION
HEARS OUR ASK FOR THE METRICS THAT WILL BE USED. THEY WILL USE
METRICS. WE'LL SHARE THEM WITH THE COMMUNITY SO WE ALL KNOW.
THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I WANT TO MENTION THAT -- YOU
MENTION THE MASK, FOR THE COMMUNITY, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN
THAT THE SCHOOLS HAD ON THAT CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE SOME
DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE HAD WITH THOSE EFFORTS. I CAN SHARE WITH
YOU THE BACKGROUND, BUT I WANT TO PROVIDE THERE'S ADDITIONAL
CONTEXT THERE. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS
ORDER. I WANT TO SAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER WE
CAN NORMALIZE INDOOR MASK WEARING, EVEN WHEN COVID -- IT MAY
NEVER FULLY GOES AWAY. ONCE IT DIES DOWN SOMEWHAT. AND ONE
REASON, THINK ABOUT THAT, IT IS THE FLU. DURING NORMAL YEARS, CAN
SOMETIMES KILL UPWARDS OF 50,000 PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN A
FLU SEASON. IN 2019, RATHER IN 2020, THE FLU SEASON WAS MUCH
REDUCED, IN LARGE PART EXPERTS BELIEVE BECAUSE WE WERE PRACTICING
SOCIAL DISTANCING AND INDOOR MASK WEARING.
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS OF
INDOOR MARRING WEARING AND WHILE WE WOULDN'T WANT TO MAINTAIN
A MANDATE ONCE WE NO LONGER NEED IT, WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT IT
IS ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA TO WEAR A MASK INDOOR S, PARTICULARLY THE
MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AMONG US.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE A FUTURE DISCUSSION WITH
PUBLIC SAFETY AROUND THAT IDEA AND SO FORTH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
ON THE POLICY ORDER? SEEING NONE, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON


PAGE 25

May 25, 2021

ADOPTION?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER FIVE. (READING POLICY
ORDER NUMBER FIVE). COUNCILLOR SIMMONS PULLED IT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I YIELD TO THE LEAD SPONSOR AND THEN I WILL
SPEAK.

POLICY ORCER #4
ADOPTED
That the City Manager be and
is hereby requested to work
with the Public Health
Department and report back to
the City Council on the
milestones that will be used to
determine when the indoor
mask mandate will no longer be
needed.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER, YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. CAMBRIDGE LAST
UPDATED THE FEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS COUNCIL TERM WITH A SMALL
INCREASE TO MAKE UP FOR A MISSED INCREASE THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THAT
UPDATE WAS MADE THAT WE'D SOON MEET AGAIN TO DO A MORE
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. AND HOWEVER, AFTER WE MET THAT TIME, THE
PANDEMIC HIT AND PRIORITIES CHANGED, WHICH IS FAIR. WE HAVE SEEN
THE HOUSING CRISIS CONTINUE WITHOUT PAUSE AND MANY WAYS GET
WORSE. WE HAVE SEEN NEW COMMERCIAL PROPOSAL TO BE PUT FORTH
DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WOULD HELP GENERATE FUNDING. THE
AMENDMENT IS BASED ON CAMBRIDGE'S 2019 NEXUS STUDY. THAT STUDY
MAKES CLEAR TO ACHIEVE THE FULL AMOUNT NEED FOR LOW, MODERATE,
AND MIDDLE-INCOME WORKERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE,
SUBSIDY IS NEEDED THAT COMES OUT TO A FEE PER SQUARE FOOT OF $33.34.
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE CRISIS, BUT THE NEXUS STUDY IS BASED
ON DEVELOPMENT COSTS FROM 2019, WHICH HAVE GONE UP. AND RAISING
THE FEE TO THE FULL AMOUNT AND THE STUDY IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO
TO BE A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS POLICY ORDER INCLUDES
A MOTION TO SEND THIS TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. IF
THIS PASSES, I WILL WORK WITH THE CO-CHAIR, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND
CITY STAFF TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THAT MEETING SCHEDULED AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE. I TURN IT OVER TO MY CO-CHAIR. I WILL ADD, COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN, WHO IS A SPONSOR ON THE LAST ITEM TO RAISE THIS. DOES A
LOT OF WORK ON HOUSING IN CAMBRIDGE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. PLEASED TO BE A COSPONSOR OF
THIS ORDER AS IT STATES IN THE ORDER, 2019, WE LOOKED AT INCENTIVE
ZONING, AS WE DID TWO YEARS LATER, LOOKED AT INCLUSIONARY ZONING,
ALL WITH AN EFFORT TO PUT MORE DOLLARS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
TRUST TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE KNOW AND WE HAVE
TALKED ABOUT IT, WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF MORE UNITS TO HOUSE
FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE HIGH-MARKET RATE. I'M PLEASED THE
ORDER IS HERE. I DO BELIEVE IT WILL PASS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
WORKING WITH MY CO-CHAIR ON HAVING THE CONVERSATION ON HOW TO
MOVE THIS DISCUSSION FORWARD WITH THE VIEW TOWARD INCREASING
THAT LINKAGE FEE SO WE CAN HAVE MORE FUNDS TO SUPPORT THOSE THAT
NEED PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU.

May 25, 2021

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THIS ISSUE, WHICH I FULLY SUPPORT
THAT'S BEFORE US, REALLY IS AN INCREMENT OF OUR CITY'S FOCUS ON
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, QUITE FRANKLY, EVER SINCE I CAME TO THE
CITY IN THE EARLY '70S. AT THE TIME IT MADE SENSE, WE WERE LOSING
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND NOT REPLACING IT.
I BELIEVE EVERYONE ON THIS COUNCIL WANTS MORE HOUSING. JUST ABOUT
EVERY COMMUNITY GROUP WANTS MORE HOUSING. THE WAY IT'S DONE,
THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT. THAT IS THE FOCUS AND SHOULD BE
THE MAJOR FOCUS OF ANY PLAN RELATED TO THIS THAT WE DO THAT. THIS
IS ONE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT LARGE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
SHOULD -- SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BUILD HOUSING BECAUSE WE CAN'T
GETTING THE LAND. AND SO THIS IS ONE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION, BUT IT IS
ONLY ONE STEP AND I APPLAUD IT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO ALSO THANK
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND THE OTHER
SPONSORS, I'M HAPPY TO BE ADDED TO THIS. AS COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER STATED, I WAS ONE SPONSOR WHEN WE DID THIS
PREVIOUSLY AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. I CAN ONLY
HAVE FOUR ON AT A TIME. I APPRECIATE HAVING MY NAME ADDED. I THINK
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE TO GENERATE FUNDS AND USE IT TO
MAKE SURE WE ARE BUILDING HOUSING THAT WE ALL SAY WE WANT AND
NEED. I KNOW WE NEED. MONEY IS KEY. LAND IS EXPENSIVE.
CONSTRUCTION IS EXPENSIVE. AND THE MORE MONEY WE HAVE IN THE
TRUST, THE MORE MONEY WE HAVE TO SUB ELEMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING
BEING BUILT. IT MEANS THE MORE WE'LL GET. AND WHEN WE RAISE THIS
THE LAST TIME, IT WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AT THE TIME. THERE
WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT NOT GOING TOO FAR BECAUSE WE WERE
UNSURE AS TO WHAT THAT WOULD DO. WHERE THAT BREAKING POINT WAS.
I THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN GO MUCH HIGHER THAN WHERE WE ARE
AND WE NEED TO GO MUCH HIGHER. AND SO I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND MOVING THIS FORWARD
AND GENERATING MORE FUNDS FOR HOUSING.
SO, THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO ADD MY NAME AND THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AT THE TIME. AND FINALLY MOVING IT ALONG TO
THE NEXT FASHION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. WE'LL DO THAT
AND BEFORE WE DO THAT, I WILL ADD MY TWO CENTS. AS ONE OF THE
SPONSORS PUSHING FOR THE STUDY THAT WAS COMPLETED, ALONG WITH
MANY OF US HERE, WE GOT THAT STUDY. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT THINGS
IN THAT. AND HOW WE USE IT IS KEY. AND I THINK HAVING THAT
DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THE ACTUAL AMOUNT THAT
WE RAISE TO BEYOND THIS PROPOSED INCREASE AND A PATH FORWARD SO IT
IS CODIFIED WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE. I THINK BECAUSE OF THE


PAGE 27

May 25, 2021

PANDEMIC, THINGS SHIFTED AND WE HAVEN'T -- WE HAVE TALKED A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THAT STUDY, I THINK IT MERITS FURTHER DISCUSSION. AND
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT CAME UP IN PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL
THAT WE CAN TALK THROUGH.
THANK YOU TO THE COSPONSORS. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON ADDING
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?

Motion to add Councillor
McGovern to Policy Order #5

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THE AMENDED POLICY ORDER, ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE NOW MOVE TO THE NEXT POLICY ORDER, WHICH IS
THE POLICY ORDER -- MY SHEET IS MISSING. ONE SECOND. GO AHEAD.

Policy Order #5 refered to the
Ordinance Committee and the
Planning Board

>> MR. CLERK: I WILL MAKE A CLARIFICATION FOR THE RECORD, ZONING
ORDINANCE, REFERRED TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND THE PLANNING
BOARD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. MOVING TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 7. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 7). FILED BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND PULLED BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WILL YIELD TO THE MAJOR SPONSOR, IF HE
WISHES TO SPEAK. THE REASON I PULLED IT IS TO BE ADDED AS A
COSPONSOR BASED ON MY HISTORY AND TO BRING UP THAT COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS HAS ALSO BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THIS AREA FOR MANY YEARS.
WHY DON'T I CONTINUE? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND I SEPARATELY HAVE
ISSUED SIMILAR POLICY ORDERS THAT WERE APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY. I
BELIEVE, EACH OF US HAVE DONE IT AT LEAST TWO TIMES. I HAVE SPOKEN AT
CONFERENCES IN CAMBRIDGE ON THIS SUBJECTED AND INVITED TO SPEAK IN
NEW YORK AND INDEED DID THAT. AND MARCHED IN NEW YORK ON THE
SUBJECT. THAT'S WHY I WISH TO BE ADDED AS A COSPONSOR. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GREAT. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROSTER.
WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON ADDING YOU AS THE COSPONSOR.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IF COUNCILLOR SIMMONS WANTS TO BE ADDED
SINCE SHE WAS MENTIONED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES, THANK YOU.

ORDER NUMBER 8). FILED BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER, MYSELF,
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IF COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER WISHES TO GO
FIRST, I DEFER AND COME BACK. IF THAT IS THE WISH.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. GRATEFUL TO THE
COSPONSORS FOR THIS. GLAD TO PUT IT FORWARD AND EXCITED TO SHARE
THE NEWS, DARWIN'S MANAGEMENT HAS AGREED TO VOLUNTARY
RECOGNIZE THE UNION THROUGH A CARD CHECK PROCESS, WHICH IS A
GREAT STEP. I'M A BIG FAN OF DARWIN'S COFFEE AND SANDWICHES AND
EXCITED TO HAVE A LOCAL COFFEE SHOP AND UNION COFFEE SHOP. IN
RECOGNITION OF THAT, I PUT FORWARD AN AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THE
SECOND RESOLVED. CONGRATULATE THE MANAGEMENT AND THE WORKERS
ON THE UNION. AND I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN SENT AN AMENDMENT
AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE THE AMENDMENT THAT THE CLERK WILL
PULL UP. WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. SHOULD I TALK OVERALL?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TALK ABOUT THE AMENDMENT AND ANYTHING ELSE?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M HAPPY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. ALSO, AS
MANY OF US KNOW, DARWIN'S IS AN EXEMPLARY SMALL BUSINESS. I HOPE
WE CAN WALK THE TALK OF SUPPORTING, CELEBRATING, AFFIRMING, AND
UPLIFTING ALL SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES. I SUPPORT UNIONS AND I'M
EXCITED TO HEAR, I BELIEVE IT WAS FRIDAY, DARWIN'S SAID THEY WOULD
AGREE TO THE CHECK WHICH WAS REQUEST FROM DARWIN'S UNITED. I'M
HAPPY THIS LED TO A RECOGNITION AGREEMENT ALREADY. I HOPE WE CAN
SEND A MESSAGE TO ALL WORKERS WE APPRECIATE THEM AND TO SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS WE APPRECIATE THEM. AT THE SAME TIME, THE TIMING
OF THIS ORDER WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THE EFFORT TO
UNIONIZE WILL ENCOUNTER RESISTANCE, PUTS THE COUNCIL IN AN
AWKWARD POSITION TO APPEAR TO NOT SUPPORT SOME OF THE SMALL
BUSINESSES IN THE CITY. I HOPE WE CAN REMEMBER TO REACH OUT, SEEK
COLLABORATION IN ALL EFFORTS TO SUPPORT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. I
SOMETIMES FAIL TO DO THAT AND I APOLOGIZE. IN THIS CASE, I HOPE WE
CAN CELEBRATE THIS AND FOCUS ON THE COMPANIES THAT DON'T TREAT
WORKERS WELL AND DON'T VOLUNTEER TO RECOGNIZE UNION. AND IN LINE
WITH THE ARTICLE ABOUT WORKERS, ALL OF US SHOULD TREAT WORKERS AS
WE'D LIKE TO BE TREATED. THERE IS TALK ABOUT HOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS
IN COFFEE SHOPS, A CHIEF CAUSE OF FRUSTRATION AND BURNOUT IN PLACES
LIKE DARWIN ARE RUDE AND INPATIENT CUSTOMERS. DO OUR PART. IN THE
SPIRIT OF RECOGNIZING THE HARD WORK OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT WORK
TOGETHER WITH DARWIN'S UNITED TO COME TO THIS POINT, I WILL OFFER
TWO WHEREAS. COMES AFTER THE LAST ONE. I SENT THEM EARLIER.
(READING FROM SLIDE PRESENTATION)
LIKE MANY SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES, IT IS HIGHER THAN MOST CORPORATE


PAGE 29

May 25, 2021

CHAINS, SETTING A STANDARD. AND BE IT RESOLVED... I THINK IT IS TERRIFIC
TO CHANGE THE RESOLVED TO APPRECIATE DARWIN'S FOR VOLUNTARY
RECOGNIZING -- I THINK WE SHOULD APPRECIATE DARWIN'S FOR THEIR
CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE OFFERED TO BARGAIN
WITH DARWIN'S UNITED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL HAVE TO FIRST VOTE ON COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S AMENDMENT. IT IS ON THE FLOOR. SO, WE'LL DO
THAT AND WE CAN MOVE TO YOUR AMENDMENTS. GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: IF IT IS AN AMENDMENT TO THAT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU HAVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT?
CLERK?
>> MR. CLERK: I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER IS PROPOSING A
REPLACEMENT RESOLVED PARAGRAPH. I BELIEVE YOU ARE TWO NEW
WHEREAS PARAGRAPHS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I THOUGHT THAT COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER
WAS BRINGING IN SOMETHING ADDITIONAL FOR THE RESOLVE. I CAN ADD IT
AND SEND IT.
>> MR. CLERK: PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLVED PARAGRAPH,
THIS IS THE TIME.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SHOULD I SEND IT TO YOU?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES, SEND IT TO THE CLERK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: HOPEFULLY, THAT WORKED. THE RED IS THE
ADDITION. AND THE GRAY WORDS ARE THE DELETION.
>> MR. CLERK: I SHARE THE AMENDMENTS ON THE SCREEN. I WILL READ THE
RESOLVED PARAGRAPH AS IT WOULD APPEAR AFTER THE AMENDMENTS
FROM COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN. SO,
TWO MOTIONS COMBINED WOULD INSERT OR REPLACE THE SECOND
RESOLVED PARAGRAPH, EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO DARWIN'S MANAGEMENT
FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR COMMUNITY IN VOLUNTARY
RECOGNIZING DARWIN'S UNION AND OFFERING TO BARGAIN WITH DARWIN'S
IN GOOD FAITH. THAT SHOULD BE "AND."
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SORRY. I LEFT OUT "AND." THERE'S A RESOLVED
AFTER THIS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THIS IS BEFORE US.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY
MISCOMMUNICATION WITH COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO ACCEPT THE WHEREAS TO CELEBRATE DARWIN'S. I DON'T SEE THE NEED
FOR CHANGES TO THE RESOLVE. BARGAINING IN GOOD FAITH IS YET TO
COME. I THINK WE SHOULD STAND WITH WORKERS AND CALL ON DARWIN'S
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND HOPE THEY DO. WHEN THEY DO, WE CAN
OFFER ANOTHER RESOLUTION. CONGRATULATING THEM ON THAT. AND
DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE EDITS TO THE RESOLVED AT THIS POINT. TO BE


PAGE 30

May 25, 2021

CLEAR, I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IN THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION WAS CALLING
OUT DARWIN'S FOR BAD ACTION. ALL WORKERS DESERVE A UNION, ALL
WORKERS DESERVE THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS THAT A
UNION -- I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION
THAT MISCONSTRUED THAT. IT IS A TOUGH TIME FOR ALL WORKERS AND WE
ARE HERE TO UPLIFT UNIONIZATION EFFORTS. AND CONGRATULATE THE
MANAGEMENT AND THE WORKERS AT DARWIN'S FOR RECOGNIZING THE
UNION DRIVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK BY INCLUDING BOTH
OF THEM, IT DOES BOTH. UPLIFT THE WORKERS AND STATES THE RESOLVED
BEFORE THIS. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE RIGHT OF WORKERS TO UNIONIZE
AND MOST -- IT IS VERY MUCH IN LIGHT WITH SUPPORTING UNIONIZATION.
IT RECOGNIZES THIS COUNCIL HAS TAKEN SO MANY ACTIONS AND HAS SEEN
DOZENS OF SMALL BUSINESSES GO UNDER. IT SEEMS TO ME, IT DOES MAKE
SENSE FOR US TO SPECIFICALLY DO BOTH, HIGHLIGHT AND SAY, WORKERS
SHOULD BE, IT IS A TRAGEDY THERE IS NOT MORE UNIONIZATION IN THE
COUNTRY, AND ALSO TRUE THAT SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES LIKE DARWIN'S
WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO THE COMMUNITY, WHO CONTINUES
TO MAKE DONATION EVEN AS THEY LOSE MONEY TO NONPROFITS THAT I'M
AWARE OF, WE ARE APPRECIATING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. MY
UNDERSTANDING IS, THEY HAVE ALREADY OFFERED TO BARGAIN IN GOOD
FAITH. WE CAN URGE THEM TO BARGAIN ON GOOD FAITH, BUT THEY HAVE
OFFERED. IT SEEMS WE SHOULD ENSURE WE SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WE
SUPPORT SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES. WE HAVE SPENT MANY HOURS SAYING
WE SUPPORT. THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST THEY WERE NOT GOOD
SUPPORTERS. IT CREATED CONSTERNATION AND -- WHY IS THE COUNCIL
WEIGHING IN. I DEFENDED THE COUNCIL AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES WAS
CONCERNED THE COUNCIL WASN'T APPEARING TO BE AS SUPPORTIVE TO
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND I WANT TO BE SURE WE DO THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TO THE COUNCIL, THE AMENDMENT IS BEFORE US. PER
THE CLERK, VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT FIRST. AND
THEN PROCEED TO THE AMENDMENT ITSELF. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE. I
THINK THE BODY WILL VOTE AS IT SEES FIT ON THIS MATTER. AND WE CAN
GO FROM THERE.
>> MR. CLERK: THE FIRST VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT FROM COUNCILLOR
NOLAN TO THE AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO-WHEELER. ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). SEVEN IN FAVOR AND
TWO AGAINST.
NEXT VOTE WILL BE ON COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER'S AMENDMENT AS
AMENDED. THIS WILL INCLUDE IT INTO THE TEXT OF THE POLICY ORDER.
