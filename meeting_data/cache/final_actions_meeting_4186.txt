21ST CENTURY BROADBAND FOR THE
City Council Roundtable Discussion
November 28, 2022

Packet Pg. 5

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Broadband feasibility study illustrates several paths forward for the City
• A Cambridge fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) network would offer symmetrical gigabit internet
service with affordable option for low-income customers, offering greater choice for
Cambridge residents, local control, and competition against incumbent cable provider.
• A detailed cost estimate is being finalized in order to perform a feasibility analysis, which
shows the take-rates and pricing needed to meet financial return targets and the sensitivity
of the results to key assumptions—including the potential of City subsidization.
• The financial feasibility of the network also depends on the structure of the selected
business model, which could include any of a range of partnerships with private entities in
which the City sets requirements and goals. Nationally we have observed an increase in
private market interest in participating in FTTP in certain cable monopoly cities.

• Should the City decide to move forward, the next steps involve engagement with potential
partners to validate feasibility and explore potential partnership structures.

MARKET OVERVIEW
Municipal FTTP would primarily compete on a strong local brand with similar pricing to
existing cable offerings, while achieving key public policy goals
• Pricing: The service would offer symmetrical gigabit service with indicative price points of
$70 gigabit ($30 for low-income households, aligned with Affordable Connectivity Program) –
but would likely face promotional pricing pressure from existing providers
• Product: While a fiber product would initially provide a stronger product, Comcast is focused
on infrastructure improvements that could achieve gig symmetry
• Brand: A key competitive advantage would be brand with marketing focused on local pride
and values (data privacy, net neutrality, digital equity, strong local customer service) to drive
adoption and win loyalty

• Public Policy Goals: A municipal offering could ensure policy goals that aren’t being met in
the market, including increased competition, digital equity, data privacy, and net neutrality

MARKET OVERVIEW
Based on national benchmarks, a target take-rate of 30-40% seems feasible in
Cambridge with strong operational and marketing execution
• Successful publicly traded telcos with FTTP operations focus
on achieving 35-40% market penetration

• Higher market penetration above 40% is possible in markets
with weak or no cable competitor; successful case examples
with municipal FTTP networks are mostly run by municipal
electric companies with an existing customer base
• Municipal FTTP networks that are ending up lower than 30%
exhibit poor execution, competition from both cable and
telco FTTP (i.e., Verizon FiOS), and are mostly suburban
markets

– Physical walk-out or drive survey of 100% of
156 miles of candidate public right of way:
62.1% aerial (utility poles available) + 37.9%
underground
– Data collected in real-time using custom
GPS/GIS tools to accurately record findings
• Generated GIS data to inform cost estimates
and market conditions

Notes: See Appendix for more detail

– Presence of existing utility poles
– Make-ready assessment of utility poles
– Presence of existing broadband
infrastructure (cable, fiber, legacy telecom)
Packet11
Pg. 15

INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT
Based on field survey, the proposed network design would create a robust
infrastructure that could serve the city with leading edge technology for decades
• Citywide FTTP comprised of 130.3 route
miles:
– 80.9 miles (62.1%) aerial (utility poles
available)
– 49.4 miles (37.9%) underground

• Key elements would include redundant core
hub sites, fully diverse backbone ring, and
primary/secondary distribution

FINANCIAL MODEL
A custom financial model is being developed to understand business case and key
sensitivities
Key inputs include:
• Capital expenses: Outside plant, network equipment, drops, CPE, buildout schedule, etc.
• Pricing: Target pricing based on market, mix of full paying vs. low-income

• Take rate / adoption curve: Steady state take rate, take rate ramp up, churn
• Operating expenditures:
– Labor costs
– Non-labor parametric operating costs (e.g., $x per pole times n poles)
– Other non-labor operating costs (e.g., $x per month for insurance)
• Inflation adjustment (capex, opex, revenue)
• Capital grant funding: City subsidy to reduce initial capital expenses
• Financing conditions: Interest rate, expected return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, term, etc.

PARTNERSHIP OPTIONS
The study will examine several business models the City could employ to partner with
private sector companies while meeting its policy goals
• Beyond the binary options of fully municipal or fully private networks, there exists several
distinct and plausible possibilities for structuring the contractual relationships between the
City and potential partners and the funding/financing of the network
– Several types of companies could potentially be interested in a partnership with
Cambridge including P3 (public-private partnership) infrastructure investors (e.g.,
Meridiam, Plenary), ISPs offering standalone broadband (e.g., Google Fiber, Ting), and
traditional ISPs.
• In any partnership, active City involvement would be needed, including by facilitating
buildout (expedited permitting, micro-trenching, etc.) and possibly contributing financially to
the project
• Partnership is likely a critical component given that Cambridge does not have a municipal
electric utility, which is typically the foundation of successful City-run broadband businesses

PARTNERSHIP OPTIONS
Partnership could offer significant advantages while the City could ensure key public
policy goals are met
What City could gain…
• De-risking business model
through market validation
• Operational and marketing
expertise in a highly
competitive and fastchanging business
• Potential private capital
investment to reduce upfront
costs

…what City could give up…
• Upside revenue potential
• Control over day-to-day
business operations and
market rate setting

…what City could retain
• Fiber service to all City
premises
• City long-term ownership of
fiber infrastructure
• Affordable options and
pricing control for low-income
households
• Key policy goals around data
privacy and net neutrality

Final report will include recommendations on partnership options and more detailed analysis
of pros/cons

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Mailed survey was met with a strong response and has high degree of statistical
validity
• 5,000 survey packets mailed to a random set of Cambridge residential addresses
• Of these, 3,000 went to low-income households (to plan for typically lower response)
• Goal was 450 responses; results exceeded goal, with 604 responses

• Results developed data on relevant topics including
o Current providers used and prices paid
o Willingness to switch to a new FTTP provider at various price points
o Level of support for City taking on a role or subsidizing

Packet20
Pg. 24

MUNICIPAL LIGHT PLANT (MLP) STRUCTURE
MLPs are used by some Massachusetts municipalities that directly run broadband
businesses in particular contexts
• An MLP is a Massachusetts legal entity that enables a municipality to directly run an
electricity, gas or (more recently) telecommunications company
– Some longstanding MLPs that provide electricity (e.g., Braintree, Norwood) entered the
cable broadband business about 20 years ago leveraging utility expertise and assets
– Certain rural western Massachusetts towns created MLP structures solely to provide
broadband service using one-shot state capital grants, but the context differs
• Creating a Cambridge MLP would be required if the City wishes to directly run a broadband
company, but by itself does not affect business feasibility
• The City does not need an MLP to build a network that would be operated by a partner who
would in turn provide broadband service
Note: Statements are general in nature and subject to updated legal guidance by qualified counsel. Neither CTC nor Rebel provide legal advice.

COST ESTIMATION OBJECTIVES
Purpose-built analysis to support strategic broadband planning
Understand the range of costs to deploy a state-of-the-art FTTP network under various scenarios for
scope and construction methodologies
• Physical fiber plant construction and design – aerial vs underground, MDU connectivity and interior wiring
• Network hub facilities – redundancy and scale, use of existing facilities
• Network electronics at varying take-rates
• Customer activation costs (service drops and CPE) at varying take-rates

Inform financial modeling and negotiations with candidate private partners
• Generate breakdowns of component parts corresponding to division of capex contributions for most likely partnership
scenarios and targeted populations
– Active vs passive infrastructure
– Wiring of MDUs containing affordable housing
• Collect field data and analysis that can be shared with candidate partners to support their own cost modeling
– Determine availability of existing utility poles and ascertain pole make-ready cost factors
– Characterize make-up of MDU structure types and related deployment cost
