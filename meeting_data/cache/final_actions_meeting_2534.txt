The Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing on the proposed Demolition Delay
Ordinance.
Councillor Kelley opened the hearing at 4:00 PM.
Steve Bardige, 55 Stearns Street, one of the petitioners, spoke in support of the proposed ordinance. He made a
presentation to the committee which is attached to these minutes.
The presentation explained that there was a high rate of demolitions in Cambridge .
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Bardige explained that 12 months was selected based on
information gathered from conversations with the Historic Commission, City Councillors and a survey of demolition
delay ordinances in other communities.
In response to a question from Mayor McGovern, Mr. Bardige explained that any structure in ACambridge that is
over 50 years old is covered by ordinance.
In response to a question from Councillor Mallon, Mr Bardige explained that there is little to no "hard" data on the
negative economic impact of an increased demolition delay period. Councillor Mallon expressed her concern about
the potential negative impact on home buyers.
Councillor Kelley opened the floor to city staff.
Charles Sullivan, director of Cambridge Historical Commission, explained that the City of Cambridge implemented
a demolition delay in 1979. The Historic Commission automatically conducts a hearing on the 5th month of any
delay to determine if the structure should be considered for a land mark designation study. That study can last for
12 months. He explained the executive director of the Historic Commission can make an initial determination of a
building's historical significance. He explained that the Historic Commission is supportive of the proposal as
written.
