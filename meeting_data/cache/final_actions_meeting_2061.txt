Subject:

Transmitting Final Report of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on
Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Mayor Simmons:
I am transmitting to you the final report of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on
Neighborhood-Based Resiliency, “Assessing and Improving Neighborhood-Based Resiliency in
Cambridge,” along with the minutes generated during the regular monthly meetings.
In our discussions, outreach, and final recommendations, we strived to set our work to the guiding
principle put forth in your organizing letter, and to focus “on new and more effective ways to build
community resilience in the face of climate change and other, more-everyday neighborhood challenges.”
Our goal was to maintain a place for Cambridge in the world, while preserving a place for our diverse
communities in Cambridge.
While the work of this Committee is not finished, nor ever can be, we believe the observations
and recommendations herein will help prepare Cambridge residents to be resilient—that is, to embody the
“capacity…to equitably survive and adapt to persistent changes, chronic stresses, and acute shocks.”
On behalf of all the Committee members, I want to extend our appreciation and thanks for
allowing us to address the challenging questions that face our city and our society. We look forward to
working with various departments and the Council to help Cambridge achieve its resiliency goals.

Sincerely,

Craig A. Kelley, Councillor

Cc: Donna Lopez, City Clerk, with instructions that this letter and attending documents be included on
the agenda in Communications from City Officers at the Regular Council Meeting of December 18, 2017.

2.2.b

The Mayor's Special Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency was convened by
Mayor Denise Simmons in 2016, chaired by Councillor Craig Kelley, and met monthly for more
than a year. Committee members represented a broad spectrum of Cambridge.
The Committee gathered information from City staff, non-profit organizations, subject
matter experts, businesses, and institutions. Starting with a focus on the effects of climate
change, the Committee developed a broader view of the social, economic, and personal
vulnerabilities and needs which are described in this report. The report identifies resiliency
challenges in the interconnected areas of infrastructure, social structure, and policy.
The report's principal recommendation is the establishment of a Chief Resiliency Officer
(CRO) as a permanent City position. A CRO can spearhead and coordinate efforts at all levels,
playing a vital role in the achievement of resiliency measures including: increased social
cohesion and mutual assistance in the neighborhoods; expanded citizen participation in
resiliency planning; greater cooperation between City agencies; ongoing assessment of City
policies and practices for their impacts on neighborhood resiliency; establishing resiliency
partnerships between the City and faith-based organizations, non-profits, businesses,
universities, neighborhood associations, and other institutions; infrastructure measures to
address storm water intrusion, reduction in paved surfaces, and expanding the City's tree
canopy; and zoning changes in areas such as green roofs, onsite power generation, and flooding
notification and response plans.

Executive Summary

2.2.b

In her letter establishing the Committee, Mayor Simmons tasked the chair with assembling a
Committee “with membership drawing upon the following breath of community voices.” With a diverse
Committee, pulling in a “wide variety of experiences, concerns and expertise,” the Committee could
“distill what those with a background in disaster preparedness share with the committee, in order to
formulate a comprehensive review that non-experts on the City Council and across the community will
actually be able to understand and utilize in a meaningful way.” Accordingly, the following members of
the public served as members of the Committee.

Committee Members

2.2.b

The Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-based Resiliency (hereafter referred to
as the “Committee”) held regular meetings on the last Tuesday of the month from March, 2016 through
December, 2017 (for months that were cancelled, see minutes online at CambridgeResiliency.Org). At
the Committee meetings and other listening opportunities, members heard from City staff, non-profit
organizations, subject matter experts and others involved in various aspects of resiliency planning and
implementation. These included representatives from:











Cambridge Inspectional Services Department
Cambridge Fire Department
Cambridge Department of Public Health
Cambridge Community Development Department
Cambridge Police Department
Cambridge Department of Public Works
Cambridge Water Department
Salvation Army
Eversource Power
Northeastern University

Additionally, Committee Chair Councillor Kelley met separately with representatives from various
Cambridge and non-Cambridge businesses and institutions, including:






Harvard University
MIT
Lesley College
Boston Properties
Cambridge Innovation Center
Boston Chief Resiliency Officer, Dr. Atyia Martin
Cambridge Public School District
Residents of numerous Cambridge Housing Authority buildings
Commonwealth (formerly Doorway to Dreams)

The Committee also commissioned a social cohesion survey of Cambridge residents through
Northeastern University researchers Courtney Page and Daniel Aldrich that was made available through
print mailings to residents, and posted online from October 1 through 20. The survey was designed to
help researchers better understand the important connections that bind neighborhood networks, and to
examine the fabric of Cambridge’s communities and where it might be strained. The data collection
portion of the survey has been completed, and the resulted are expected to be finished in early 2018.
The Committee reviewed how other cities around North America defined resiliency, and decided to
adopt a definition for resiliency as “the capacity of individuals, neighborhoods, institutions, businesses,
and systems within a city to equitably survive and adapt to persistent changes, chronic stresses, and
acute shocks.”

Introduction

The Committee maintained a familiar definition of neighborhoods as the same geographic entities
Cambridge uses to discuss them, numbers One through Eleven with the understanding that it was
important to always think about how neighborhoods blur, and cross over.
Although there are a number of entities that help build and sustain resiliency in and around
Cambridge, such as the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Department of Conservation and Recreation,
the State Police and so forth, the Committee focused its attention primarily on those entities over which
Cambridge has direct control, such as DPW or the Water Department. There was a secondary emphasis
on partner-type organizations that exist in Cambridge such as our universities, non-profits, faith
communities or commercial entities. The role of individual citizens and their households, as well as
where their resiliency efforts might intersect with other work in this field was always at the center of the
Committee’s discussions.
As the Committee thought about resiliency, it began to use resiliency as a way to consider issues on
two different dimensions. Take
the issue of whether or not we
have a resilient voting process
in Cambridge. At first we might
think of the problem from a
downside risk perspective. For
example, what happens if the
voting polls are compromised
in any way or if voters can't get
to the polls? Our
understanding is that
Cambridge does not, in fact,
have a back-up plan in place. A
"Plan B" approach would be a
good example of how the
Committee worked through
some scenario planning.
However, as the Committee looked more and more at resiliency, we began to also think about what
the upside perspective of resiliency would be. In the voting example, we might think about how we'd
create a climate and ecosystem where voters wanted to vote, found it easy to get to the polls, and had
access to information needed to make create a positive experience. Similarly, take the example of food
availability. We can think about whether or not trucks may not be able to deliver food to supermarkets
and how long it would take for suppliers to run out of food. Or we could think about food waste, the
effectiveness of food sell by dates, and making communal gardening more widely available. As you'll see
in the report, many of the issues the Committee grappled with can be viewed through multiple lenses.
We believe, then, that resiliency can be viewed as a process of working through challenges on multiple
dimensions and in fact that building out a broader perspective of both proactive and reactive scenarios
is itself an important part of building resiliency.

2.2.b

2.2.b

During its early discussions, the Committee approached the issue of neighborhood-based resiliency
with a heavy emphasis on climate change and the need for neighborhoods to be resistant to threats,
such as flooding, extreme heat, drought, flash floods, invasive species and similar climate-related natural
challenges. Over the course of its work the Committee realized that, especially for Cambridge’s most
vulnerable residents, being resilient also includes job security, financial literacy, and access to
appropriate food options, affordable housing, and similar immediate needs. Climate change remains a
specific resiliency threat but it is also a ‘force magnifier’ for other resiliency challenges.
After reviewing a wide variety of inputs, the Committee found that there were three actionable
areas for improvement: infrastructural resiliency, soft structure resiliency, and policy changes. The first
consists of engineering and preparedness issues, the second focuses on human capital, social cohesion
and social science issues, and finally City policies include zoning and licensing changes. While these three
types of resiliency often complement each other and are each important, it was often noted that there
is frequently a gap between them.
The Committee further recognized that past examples of resiliency challenges, whether from storms
or financial upheavals, can be informative in developing current resiliency plans but are not
dispositive—our collective future contains vast amounts of uncharted territory that will require
imagination, knowledge and flexibility to successfully navigate. In the face of a changing world, resiliency
must reflect ongoing and emerging needs. The need for resiliency efforts to be continuously adaptive in
nature makes a formal and intentional civic and municipal focus on resiliency all the more important or
our resiliency efforts will quickly become outdated and inadequate.
Based on its work over more than a year, the Committee came up with specific requirements for,
and characteristics of a resilient city. The Committee also developed a number of specific
recommendations for improving resiliency in Cambridge’s neighborhoods.
While some resiliency efforts, such as ‘flood proofing’ Fresh Pond require significant capital
investments at the municipal level, many resiliency efforts, such as putting personal labels on electronic
devices for easy identification and return should they be misplaced, are not only simple but have daily
applicability. True resiliency focuses on building core competencies to meet life’s challenges at a minor
level which, woven together as individuals and communities, build a greater level of communal
resiliency than the sum of the various parts and can help mitigate the impact of ‘problems of
consequence.”
Nonetheless, neighborhood-based resiliency requires significant investment by municipal
government in terms of intentional outreach and education, assistance in evaluating and addressing
risks, developing protocols for assessing resiliency impacts of government decisions and so forth.
Because effective emergency planning decreases the impact of disasters at all levels, such municipal
resiliency programs pay for themselves in avoided costs when stressful situations occur.
To ensure that Cambridge focuses, and stays focused, on the challenges of building resiliency at the
neighborhood level, the Committee recommends that it create the position of a Chief Resiliency Officer.
This position, already adopted in many other cities such as Boston and Baltimore, would allow the City

Findings

2.2.b

Attachment: Final Report Neighborhood Based Resiliency 2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

to be more intentional in its resiliency-building efforts and having a specific resiliency point of contact
would help ensure that work in this area is coordinated across agencies and neighborhoods and builds
resiliency for individuals, families, households and neighborhoods.

Page 9 of 25
Packet Pg. 34

2.2.b

Through its conversations with various community stakeholders, the Committee identified several
resiliency challenges to Cambridge residents that should be addressed by community leaders in
municipal government, nonprofits, universities, and neighborhoods. A number of these challenges are
also reflected in Cambridge-specific data such as Community Development Department (CDD) reports,
but many identified challenges reflect perceived or intuitive aspects of resiliency and as such are not
directly supported by Cambridge-specific data. Some of these challenges present as traumatic events to
which residents must respond and are acute. These might include flooding events, fires, or increasingly
violent storms. In addition to these challenges, we have added systemic, or passive challenges, which
are at the core of one’s ability to respond to a traumatic event resiliently.
All structures in a neighborhood might sustain comparable damage from a flooding event, for
example, but the ability of residents and families to mitigate that impact—whether to adapt or thrive in
the aftermath—depends heavily on countless other resiliency factors. Resiliency challenges such as lack
of social cohesion, inequitable wealth distribution, and inequitable educational results, problematic in
their own right, can multiply or enhance the stress and disruption of a traumatic event. When families
struggle to meet the demands of everyday life, traumatic events and disasters can prove existential.
Building resilient neighborhoods, then, will require that municipal authorities address systemic
resiliency challenges to allow all residents to mitigate shared traumas and adapt equitably. Although
these systemic challenges are listed separately here, they can be and often are combined, and may be
applicable to any applicable acute traumatic events.

Lack of Social Cohesion
•

•

•
•

Isolated individuals without a neighborhood network to share resources, skills, and
institutional access are more at risk to all threats. This can be especially true for seniors,
transient communities, recent immigrants, non-English speakers, and undocumented
immigrants.
As a college town, Cambridge experiences a frequent churn of transient residents. As much
as 31.3% of the Cambridge population are individuals 18 years or older who are enrolled
full-time or part-time in a college or graduate school degree program.
Cambridge has a disproportionate number of renters, with some 65.4% of housing units
being rented. (CDD, Demographics and Statistics FAQ)
Fences between yards, lack of common spaces in dense neighborhoods, and infrequent
connection outside of the local community make building social cohesion tougher for
residents.

Lack of Affordable Housing
•

The rise of housing prices, for both rent and purchase, has made it difficult for many people
to live in Cambridge without paying well over 30% of their income in rent. (CDD, MiddleIncome Rental Program)
Page 10 of 25
Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: Final Report Neighborhood Based Resiliency 2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Cambridge’s Resiliency Challenges

2.2.b

•

Very few private units exist in Cambridge that are inexpensive enough for someone with a
low income to afford even with a HUD voucher.
Wait-lists for CHA apartments are both long and often frozen.

Inequitable Wealth Distribution
•

•

Many long-term residents without higher degrees are unable to compete financially for
housing, services, or goods with people who work for Cambridge’s high-tech companies
such as Google, Microsoft, or Biogen.
Lack of readily available financial instruments and financial literacy.

Inequitable Educational Results
Educational results are uneven, with students of color and/or students from economically
disadvantaged families disproportionately not doing as well as white students. (DOE) This
suggests that a discrete block of our student population does not gain the necessary
academic skills to compete in Cambridge’s housing and job markets. Results of these
disparities include displacement from market-rate housing and people feeling that they or
their neighbors have been ‘forced’ out of Cambridge.

•

2.2.b





Food swamps lack in access of healthy or diverse foods, typically offering only to lownutrition food for many of Cambridge’s more vulnerable residents.
“High-end” supermarkets such as Whole Foods are not accessed equally, increasing
gentrification in some markets.
Expense of food and other issues, such as understanding how to cook certain foods, can
result in poor nutrition meals even where healthier options are geographically accessible.

Urban Heat Island Effect
•
•
•
•

Cambridge is expected to have three times as many cooling days in 2030 as it does now.
Decreasing tree canopy around the City increases localized Urban Heat Island Effects.
(Cambride)
Paving of parking lots, driveways, streets and so forth increases Urban Heat Island Effect.
Urban Heat Island Effect is especially dangerous for seniors without dependable access to
air conditioned spaces, to include sleeping spaces.

Flooding
•

•

•
•

•

Much of Cambridge is in a 100/500 year floodplain such as Alewife, meaning that during a
storm event that statistically should happen only once every 100/500 years, the area will
experience flooding. Other parts of Cambridge are subject to localized drainage backups
and floods during intense rainfall or snowmelt events such as The Port. (Cambride)
Eventually, Sea Level Rise (SLR) and storm surges will push floodwater from Boston Harbor
over or around the Mystic and Charles River dams, flooding adjacent lands. While this level
of flooding is not anticipated to occur for decades, it is possible that such flooding will occur
sooner than predicted. Additionally, flooding of the Charles and Mystic River systems, to
include the Alewife Brook, can happen if precipitation overwhelms the Rivers’ abilities to
pump water past the dam and into the Harbor.
Flooding of underground structures such as basements or parking garages can occur
overland or through groundwater movement in Cambridge’s porous soils.
Cambridge’s flooding would largely be ‘bathtub’ type flooding without destructive currents,
but flood water of any type is highly contaminated and the resulting flood debris would
pose considerable cleanup challenges
Flooding can be very localized and somewhat unpredictable, depending on whether a sewer
drain has become clogged with leaves or snow & ice during a precipitation or melting event.

Electric Grid Vulnerabilities
•
•
•

Alewife substation is in a flood prone area.
The general grid is vulnerable to malicious actions or accidents as well as simple overload,
most especially on our hottest days when air conditioning units are most needed.
Replacement of crucial electric infrastructure is expensive, challenging and time consuming.
Some replacement equipment may have to be specially made at a time when other
Page 12 of 25
Packet Pg. 37

Attachment: Final Report Neighborhood Based Resiliency 2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Inequitable Food Access

•

•

electrical systems are seeking the same support, leading to even longer delays in bringing
the grid back on line.
Localized electric backup facilities, whether on-site generators or battery storage, provide
limited electricity, can pose fire risks and can take up valuable space or otherwise run
counter to zoning, fire safety, noise or other regulatory programs.
Without electric service, many buildings in Cambridge are likely to become uninhabitable
due to HVAC, fire safety or elevator limitations. Even buildings with backup generation
capabilities are unlikely to be able to run more than minimal health & safety functions or to
have the ability to run 24/7 for an indefinite period of time.

General Safety Concerns






Fire is a constant threat in any human environment. Cambridge experiences both major and
minor fire events and needs to have the capacity to minimize its fire threat and to respond
to fires. Individual fire safety actions, from having accessible fire extinguishers to properly
handling flammable material, are crucial to maximizing fire safety.
Mental Health awareness, appropriate staff training and provision of support services are
important factors in minimizing the challenges many of our most vulnerable residents face,
either chronically or on an episodic basis.

Crime is ongoing
concern across Cambridge but
presents itself in various ways.
Public safety organizations, such
as the Cambridge Police
Department, the Peace
Commission or the Emergency
Communications Center all have
discrete and changing roles in
ensuring both that actual
criminal activity is minimized
and that communities and
individuals receive appropriate
support after crime as occurred.

Overdoses remain a
serious public health concern.
Vice Mayor McGovern has
authored a report on how Cambridge should move to address this crisis. (McGovern)
Individuals with special needs may require special, and sometimes unique, consideration in
planning processes or support in crisis situations. Mobility limitations during a fire or other
evacuation event, street safety for the visually impaired and the need to consider food
allergies during public celebrations are examples of important special needs awareness.

2.2.b

2.2.b

A resilient city is made up of a variety of interlocking parts, none of which result in true
resiliency on its own but all of which, when connected to each other, build a resilient system.
The pieces of resiliency will be different for different situations, but there are a number of
overarching themes that, when followed, will help lay the foundation for a truly resilient city and
its neighborhoods.

Chief Resiliency Officer
A permanent Chief Resiliency Officer (CRO) who works out of the City Manager’s Office, or perhaps
in a specific office like the Peace Commission, and interacts with all Departments, with particular focus
on the outreach and services provided by:






Community Development Department
Department of Public Health
Department of Public Works (DPW)
Cambridge Police Department
Emergency Operations Center

The point is not so much that the CRO has a specific work station but that they are a known
resource for City staff who provides required oversight of all City actions from a resiliency perspective
and can tap into existing knowledge and communication networks to expand the impact of resiliency
planning efforts.
A CRO’s duties would include:











Developing a comprehensive strategy to help create a common understanding of the
characteristics of a resilient neighborhood.
Reaching to underprivileged or at-risk populations to emphasis the importance of resiliency to
ensure their resiliency capacity is on par with their more affluent peers.
Developing a ‘train the trainer’ program for resiliency for resiliency implementation efforts.
Promoting resiliency on a regular basis at all levels.
Assessing City actions for resiliency and making specific suggestions on how to improve it.
Ensuring that resiliency projects have an immediate positive impact while proactively addressing
future challenges.
Identifying localized resiliency issues, to include ones noted in Cambridge’s existing Climate
Change Vulnerability and Adaptation work. (Cambride)
Convening CRO conference for similar resiliency professionals.
Bringing resiliency-related discussions to the constituents at community meetings, school
councils, libraries and similar spaces where residents interact with each other and local
government.
Identifying, accessing and expanding existing resiliency programs, whether categorized as such
or not. For example, in an expanded definition of “resiliency” that goes beyond climate change,
the Department of Public Health’s Mental Health First Aid training program is just as important
of a tool as is the Public Work’s Urban Forestry program.

Components of a Resilient City

2.2.b

Organizing a "done by/best practices” review of how City departments and other cities are
handling resiliency.

Trust
Trust between and among City agencies, neighbors, non-profits, institutions and other local entities
is crucial in building resiliency at the neighborhood level. Trust requires room to learn from honest
mistakes, as well as honesty and transparency in relationships. Successful, mutually beneficial
interactions of all types are the foundation of trusting relationships.

Neighborhood Connection
Neighbors who know neighbors create social cohesion and are able to support each other across a
variety of experiences. The mutual assistance neighbors provide varies from the mundane, such as
taking in a neighbor’s packages for safe-keeping to bringing an elderly resident into an air conditioned
space to avoid heat stroke. The common element in any of these actions is the willingness of residents
to take the initiative to offer and accept assistance as appropriate.
The Committee commissioned a survey through Northeastern University to assess Cambridge’s
social cohesion and will revisit this issue in greater when the results of the survey are released in early
2018.

Packet Pg. 40

Attachment: Final Report Neighborhood Based Resiliency 2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)



2.2.b

A resilient city has a formalized, intentional and effective way of addressing the needs and concerns
of its most vulnerable populations that reflects, among other things, linguistic, cultural and religious
variations. These populations, who are often disassociated from City leaders and decision makers,
include:





Seniors, who are especially vulnerable to heat events or financial fraud, may find it difficult
to navigate the wide array of resources available to them.
People with disabilities
 Mentally
 People with Mental Health issues can present particular challenges
during both routine and stressful life events. Having a core set of city
staff and other individuals or institutional actors who can recognize and
respond to such circumstances in an appropriate manner can mitigate
problematic situations
 Physically
 All city policies and actions, from on-street parking delineations to snow
clearance to building renovations, need to reflect the mobility and other
challenges experienced by people who, temporarily or permanently,
have physical limitations such as being deaf, being blind, being unable
to walk and so forth.
Non-English speakers must have access to appropriate documentation in a language or
format that they can understand and act on. This includes not only having flyers and
handouts in multiple languages but also ensuring that videos and other communication
efforts do not assume that all viewers speak English or do have other constraints in
accessing city messaging efforts.

Resiliency Programs that are bottom-up in nature
Resiliency programs are, by nature, imbued with redundancy and work best when they originate
from the ‘bottom’ rather than being driven from the ‘top.’ A city that that has a common basic level of
preparedness is better able to address all challenges, whether acute or chronic. The specifics of basic
preparedness vary from situation to situation and require intentional planning in all circumstances, but
in general, basic preparedness includes the following:

Individuals
Have an adequate supply of medication on hand for home and travel and storage capacity, such as
coolers, for medications requiring special attention





Minimize the disruptions to daily activities resulting from electric loss, to include access to
flashlights and batteries, having backup phone chargers and understanding how various systems,
such as heat, air conditioning and elevators, may be impacted by a power outage.
 Have effective communication plans to include redundancies such as backups of important
numbers & emails on laminated card in wallet.
Understand their financial situation and act appropriately
Identify and protect important documents such as:
 Passport

Ability to Address the Needs of its Most Vulnerable Populations









Birth Certificate
Account passwords
Bearer bonds
Pictures
Health care proxies and similar legal documents
Have a variety of basic life skills such as
 Car care
 Knowledge of personal allergies
 Ongoing attentiveness to particular hazards
 Ice
 Tripping hazards
 Texting while walking or driving
 Understanding of how the impact of personal limitations, especially temporary ones such as
a broken leg, may impact ability to move in a fire situation, an MBTA emergency, a stormy
day

Families and Households




Understand, as a family or as household of unrelated individuals, the importance of things like
realistic communication plans, pre-arranged meeting places should members become separated in
an event, the special needs of children, how to manage allergies and other situationally important
issues.
Periodically review resiliency efforts and, as appropriate, practice drills such as escaping a burning
home.

Neighborhoods




A resilient neighborhood has plans and resources, developed and staged ahead of time, to handle a
variety of stressful events, emphasizing:
 An event’s unique challenges
 The importance of coping with challenges as a community with an emphasis on mutual
assistance
 Reliance on jointly held resources, both personal and governmental, rather than individual
stockpiling of necessities
A resilient neighborhood has clear and commonly understood expectations about the City’s role and
relevant constraints in:
 Assisting with preparedness planning
 Carrying out response operations
 Undertaking ongoing maintenance operations
 Training and supporting City staff and residents in building resiliency

2.2.b

The Committee make the following recommendations to improve Social Structure around
resiliency.

Hire a permanent Chief Resiliency Officer




Create a City procedure ‘map’ to make sure everything is reviewed for resiliency by a specific
authority such as the Chief Resiliency Officer (CRO).
Hold consistent neighborhood forums about resiliency that reflect the geographically and
culturally broad aspects of our neighborhoods to ensure maximum and diverse participation.
Support and monitor all aspects of Cambridge’s resiliency programs.

Expand Resiliency Planning beyond City agencies while still providing agency support





A formal and City-supported “Citizens Core” like in New York City.
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/em/community_business/nyc-citizen-corps.page
“Share your space” inventory for response activities where private or non-profit entities may
have potentially useful facilities. NYC provides an example:
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/em/community_business/share-your-space-survey.page
Outreach and education efforts targeted at specific populations or resiliency challenges like
NYC’s “Ready Girl”
http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/em/downloads/pdf/jobs/Ready%20NY%20Kids%20Ready%20Girl%
20Presenter%20Job%20Posting%203.pdf or families with children:
http://www1.nyc.gov/site/em/ready/kids.page

Conduct ongoing reviews of First Responders and other agencies’ abilities to manage
traditional and non-traditional stresses





FEMA has developed a report to help fire departments assess their activities in non-fire
response operations. Given how CFD is a First Responder for multiple threats, from fires to
floods to building collapses, having a formal focus on reviewing those expanding responsibilities
is important.
https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/operational_lessons_learned_in_disas
ter_response.pdf
Cambridge must view the Department of Public Works as a First Responder on par with CPD and
CFD.
CPD, the Consumers Council, the Public Libraries and other City agencies should formalize their
responsibilities and increase their capacities to educate people about digital safety and to
respond to digital crimes such as identity theft and internet-based frauds. This would include
instruction in our public Schools, at our libraries and so forth to help people acquire the skills to
be safe in a digital world. Programs already exist that are aimed at children
(https://www.pta.org/home/family-resources/safety/Digital-Safety) and adults
(https://www.microsoft.com/about/philanthropies/browsepdf.ashx?path=http://go.microsoft.c

Recommendations for Building a Resilient City: Social Structure

2.2.b






Communities of faith
Non-Government Organizations (NGO) such as the Red Cross, the Margaret Fuller House, the
YMCA and the YWCA.
Universities and employers and businesses of all sizes
Cambridge should annually review on-call contract services and contact points for resources
such as social support provided by Riverside Community Care (http://www.riversidecc.org/),
NGO emergency support from the Red Cross (http://www.redcross.org/local/massachusetts)
and government agencies such as the Small Business Administration.

Resiliency Teams
Create resiliency teams that are trained and empowered to help neighborhoods build core resiliency
competencies starting at the personal level and expanding to households and neighborhoods.

Review of school and non-school curriculum to help improve financial literacy
Conduct a review of educational programs at all levels to determine opportunities to improve financial
literacy for all Cambridge residents. One Boston-based organization that could help with this effort is
commonwealth. https://buildcommonwealth.org/

Attachment: Final Report Neighborhood Based Resiliency 2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Establishing resiliency partnerships between the City and Community Stakeholders

2.2.b

Implement a city-wide document protection program that could be encouraged and supported through
activities at local libraries or in concert with “resiliency champions” such as a local version of NYC’s
“Ready Girl.” Document management and protection has daily benefits even when the ‘disaster’ is very
small in scope, but lessons learned from large scale disasters such as wild fires and hurricanes provide
the most relevant guidance: https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2015/11/18/keep-your-importantdocuments-safe-disaster

Neighborhood building activities
Social cohesion is at the heart of a resilient neighborhood and the City could help improve that cohesion
though encouraging:
 Block parties that are more effective at building neighborhood connections. The recent “Get to
Know Your Neighbor Day” is an example of the City’s attempting to promote activities that build
relationships between neighbors.
 Developing neighborhood specific phone/text/email lists
 Simply doing ‘stuff’ together

Page 20 of 25

Document Protection

2.2.b

The Committee makes the following infrastructural recommendations to improve resiliency in
the City.

Protecting Fresh Pond from storm water intrusion




Plan, budget, build and install a removable flood barrier(s) to span any low-lying gaps between
Alewife Brook and Fresh Pond to keep flood water from getting into Fresh Pond. A possible
model exists on the National Mall by the Washington Monument: https://landcollective.com/projects/potomac-park-levee-national-mall/
When this removable barrier is created, practice installation every 6 months.

Reducing paved surfaces


Create a Paving permit process
 Require a permit before adding more than a de minimus amount of impermeable paving
on any residential or commercial space. This is already done elsewhere:
http://www.wytheville.org/townoffice/pdf/PavingPermit.pdf
 Encourage removal of paved parking areas by allowing an as-of-right
replacement of paved parking within two years

Improving tree canopy based on
future climate

Cambridge is already doing a lot
of work on tree canopy issues. These
efforts should be as robustly funded and
aggressively managed as possible. A
significant challenge is understanding
what trees to plant now that will
flourish in our climate-changed future.
Cities such as Baltimore face the same
challenge and we should collaborate
with them as we research this issue.



Review licensing and permitting requirements for public events such as block parties to ensure
that citizens find them as easy to organize as possible.
Work with collective bargaining units, determine what, if any, specific resiliency-oriented
training and responsibilities city staff should be expected to have.
Formalize a review process for new technology and emerging trends to identify potential
resiliency building strategies for Cambridge.
Conduct an annual City-wide resiliency audit that is subsequently discussed at neighborhood
meetings in the same manner as Somerville’s Resi-stat. https://www.somervillema.gov/resistat

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based
Resiliency

Members present:

Craig Kelley, Chair; Sam Seidel; Gail Kubik; Steven Wineman; Rev.
Paul Kim

Staff present:

Wilford Durbin, Acting Executive Assistant to the Committee

Public present:

John Hawkinson, Cambridge Day; Hasson Rashid

Chair Craig Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:42 p.m., thanked everyone for
coming, and introduced the scope of the committee. He invited the members to explore versions
of resiliency that they had not thought of before, and which might be more mundane than
catastrophic events, and also to expand their view beyond climate based challenges. He explained
that the idea for the resiliency committee sprung out of ongoing discussions with many members
of the public, academic representatives, church goers, and other Councillors, some of whom
included members of the committee.
Mr. Kelley explained that the city needed a more formal discussion of what resiliency
means for the entire community, and to do so, they needed to form a representative committee.
He invited members to think about people who would be interested in joining who represented
different life experiences so as to better represent the diversity of Cambridge. Members would be
an expert in something other than resiliency and climate change, who nonetheless could address
the challenges faced by the City to a general public using their individual experiences in various
communities and incorporating information provided by subject matter experts during committee
meetings.
Mr. Kelley commented that most conversations are overly aqua-centric when talking
about climate change and resiliency, but that is not the most important challenge facing
Cambridge. Rather, extreme heat will most immediately affect Cambridge.
Mr. Kelley closed opening remarks by asking the Committee to consider how it will
conduct business during its 12-14 month tenure, what issues it wishes to address, and what the
participation from the public might be.
Introductions
Members of the Committee introduced themselves.
Ice Breaker
Mr. Durbin led the Committee in an Ice Breaker exercise with word associations.
Imagining Resiliency
Mr. Kelley opened regular discussion by asking the Committee to consider what
resiliency means. He stated that he had received a number of emails from community members
interested in joining the Committee, but who first wanted to know what he meant by resiliency.
He did not want to provide a definitive answer, as he saw the primary task of the Committee to be
providing a Cambridge-based definition of resiliency, and to break away from traditional
definitions to see if they could tease something new out.
Mr. Wineman stated that bouncing back was central to his definition of resiliency,
including at an individual level, and observed how the concept is applied to abuse and trauma as

an ability to adapt. Said there were stunning variations on how individuals respond to negative
life events, and resiliency is on one end of that continuum. Defined resiliency as not just the
ability to get through, but to do so with little or no loss of spirit.
Ms. Kubik defined resiliency as the ability to adapt.
Mr. Seidel asked whether it was necessary to be impacted by events, and that adaptation
is not denial. Said a person will be different from a traumatic experience, and asked the
committee to tease out that idea.
Mr. Wineman sought to think of concrete examples. Using the food supply, he said that if
you think of a community dealing with a food shortage, on one end of spectrum is some people
getting through and on the other some people starve to death, or migrating by force or necessity.
In the latter examples a city will experience enormous suffering and disintegration of the
community, with the alternative being cooperation and support, where everyone is hungry but no
one starves. That is what he pictured when he imagined resiliency.
Ms. Kubik stated that from a formal building perspective, buildings have lifespans. How
planners build in redundant systems into those structures so that they can change use, or survive
an event, or adapt, or serve another communal purpose are crucial to resiliency of that building.
How do you build in adaptability over the lifetime of a building is a constant question for
planners.
Mr. Seidel returned to discuss the definition of resiliency, and remarked that a frequent
vision of resiliency is to be prepared, and the other is to weather an event with damage but still
making it through.
Mr. Wineman added a third definition that it is some combination of the two together.
That part of resiliency which is preparation only goes so far. He said that a plan that only relies on
preparedness is more brittle than building a community to adapt and shift the load of an event.
He continued that a community plan that relies solely on bringing out the best in people is
going to be less effective, because to rely on best practices in the absence of buildings that are
multi- use, for example, complicates their efforts. When the best is being brought out of people,
the city should have structures in place that make people known to each other so that relationships
are made.
Rev. Kim added that in other communities, each family has a food storage so that every
family can survive a nuclear attack, for example. He is amazed when going into family owned
bunkers how well constructed they are. Though he noted that Cambridge does not have to face
similar problems.
Mr. Kelley interjected that Cambridge hasn’t faced those problems yet. Events like
tornados are still possible, and in fact have occurred in the recent past in nearby communities.
Rev. Kim marveled at the response after the Boston bombing, how local cities are now
prepared for a similar events.
How should Cambridge define resiliency?
Mr. Durbin asked the committee to consider how Cambridge might define resiliency
differently than their local neighbors. If one accepts a definition of resiliency as the ability to
bounce back, he said, then that definition must take into account the local exigencies of each
community prior to a catastrophic event, which are different. Cambridge has two universities and
a robust bio-tech corridor, how might a Cambridge specific definition of resiliency take into
account those institutions?
Mr. Seidel spoke to the human side of resiliency. He divided the human response into
what he called “Official Resiliency,” including police, firefighters, first responders, EMT, etc.,
but said that can be overly strained. Such a situation developed after Hurricane Sandy, for
example, and in their absence there was the other “Human element,” which was untrained
individuals, that was relied upon to form a response.

2.2.c

Neighborhood Based Resiliency
Mr. Kelley directed the conversation to the definition of “Neighborhood-Based
Resiliency.”
Ms. Kubik said that ownership formed a crucial component in that definition, taking it
down to blocks and parcels. Where people feel ownership for a certain place, they should may be
encouraged to establish resiliency for that neighborhood.
Mr. Wineman thought that citizens knowing their neighbors and having a commitment to
each other formed the foundation of neighborhood-based resiliency.
Mr. Seidel pointed out that a neighborhood has definitive boundaries to them, which can
present a different set of issues in terms of cooperation and engagement. A neighborhood has
geographic boundaries. He didn’t know if it’s a good thing or not in terms of forming a response.
Mr. Wineman commented that some of these boundaries fall on semantics, he hoped to
be internally clear on the Committee’s terms. Some people would use community and
neighborhood differently, he said, to include the whole City and perhaps different cities.
Mr. Kelley said that community might migrate across borders, such as in church
environments, and that these different connections were important when talking about building
systems.
Mr. Wineman thought it might be useful to define neighborhood as a concretely defined
geographic place, whereas community means an affiliation between people. Such affiliations may
be defined by schools, interests, religions, and identities. At its core, he thought a community
represented a conscious affiliation between people based on something shared.
Rev. Kim said that the city has eleven neighborhoods, and when he picks up parking
permit the City is already dividing communities by neighborhoods. Coming to the more concrete
neighborhood example would be useful, and thought Neighborhood Crime Watch networks might
be useful to structure resiliency responses.
Mr. Kelley noted how hard it can be to be connected to Cambridge’s multiple
communities. While he has numerous email lists, and communication connections between
several different communities throughout the city, he didn’t, for example, have one specifically
for Central Square, and so one person might receive numerous identical Central Square related
communications through his neighborhood-based lists. This illustrated the need to have multiple
definitions of neighborhood.
Mr. Seidel asked how the Committee might deal with a building with 25 floors, like
Rindge Towers, that house so many people that may not consider themselves a community, who
may not know each other, and who may not have similar backgrounds. He further asked how the
Committee might think about people who work in Cambridge.
Mr. Wineman explained that neighborhoods have boundaries, and to the extent that
people identify with their neighborhood, it creates an “other,” which may have negative impact
on cooperative efforts. His ideal vision of resiliency in Cambridge was one that starts with a
neighborhood base, a sense of community affiliation within a neighborhood, and which is then
nested between neighborhoods. In a food shortage, for example, he imagined various
neighborhoods taking care of each other internally, and then down the line, those various
communities checking in each other. In this way, hyper-parochialism is constantly addressed.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said that the Committee did not need to agree on a definition for resiliency
during its first meeting. He stress, however, that how Cambridge defines resiliency is important
because it shapes other discussions about the need to address zoning, equip the fire department,
and gauge a response. As a city, he said, we want to have an idea on what we should spend our
money on.

Mr. Seidel pointed out that some neighborhoods are going to start with different
capacities, and those with more are going to address their problems more quickly. He asked how
the city might frame resiliency equitably to account for those differences.
Mr. Kelley added that different parts of the city face different challenges. Cambridge is
facing a persistent threat to its tree canopy from the death of numerous street trees, a trend which
he thinks will continue in the future. To reverse this trend, the City is encouraging residents to
plant and care for trees in their yards and behind their sidewalk. While more trees planted would
have a broad impact on the entire community, the City relies on individual actions. How people
manage the trees in their yard will depend on the resources people have, which as previously
mentioned, are not equally distributed.
Rev. Kim said that Cambridge is especially in a unique position with two major
universities. The university themselves form their own communities. When he thinks about a
neighborhood, however, he doesn’t think about dorms, but some are every bit as large as
neighborhoods.
Ms. Kubik observed that from the outside, a community might end at the campus
boundary, and asked how relationships can form across those lines. When universities are the
institutions with resources and capacities, while the outside communities have not, how can those
resources be equitably shared?
Mr. Seidel reflected that there are many students and workers who may not identify with
a Cambridge community or neighborhood at all, but they are still part of the city fabric, and if a
catastrophic event occurs, they will still rely on the City’s resiliency network.
Mr. Seidel asked the Committee whether it thought that a catastrophic event had to occur
for resiliency to occur, or whether it was latent or passive. He further inquired whether resiliency
implied a perfect world.
Mr. Wineman responded that for him, resiliency implied quite the opposite. It did not
imply internal perfection. He stated that he associated vulnerability with our humanness. But
recognizing our weaknesses is not to be vulnerable, but rather the opposite, he argued. It is not
strength to deny weaknesses. In the context of being resilient, an openness to the experience of
vulnerability is critical to the robustness of a resiliency response system.
Mr. Seidel observed that the definition of “vulnerable,” implies “woundable,” which he
equated to a chink in the armor. It required some event to happen to find that one weakness.
Mr. Kelley asked whether it should be the city’s responsibility to have a ready-made flier
with fixed and variable fields to post in neighborhoods to answer questions after certain events.
He stated that he didn’t think the City had a great communication system to circulate information
on events and the city’s ongoing response.
Mr. Wineman asked what the role of the city should be in preparing resiliency. He noted
that discussion up to that point had been focused on a diverse response, but the Committee
needed to address centralized response as well. He hoped the Committee would develop a formal
structure for thinking about this, both to form concrete recommendations, and think about
blending decentralized responses and centralized responses.
Mr. Seidel said that the City has systems that are in place, some of which are paid for
through large federal grants, and thus he doubted whether the City would be likely to change its
practices after the recommendations from the Committee.
Mr. Kelley thought the Committee could explore much more common experiences
besides those requiring a FEMA response team. He pointed out that Cambridge will be facing a
warming world, and when people leave their homes to escape the heat on summer nights, how the
City might address and respond to such people differently than a party going on outside could be
explored by the Committee. He stated that while snow doesn’t kill people, aside from accidents,
heat can be lethal. This would be only further compacted when a power outage eliminates air
conditioning.

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman asked for the Committee’s indulgence in expressing that an economic
collapse is a certainty. He said that the timeframe for such an event is imponderable, but it is not
localized to Cambridge or the United States. He said that as a species we are consuming the
world’s resources, and we cannot sustain an economy when they run out. We will get to a
position where there are cascading economic effects. He stated that in some ways we already
have felt those effect, and that if it had not been an El Nino year, the CA drought would have
continued to destabilize an economy that provides much of the food for the United States.
Ms. Kubik asked if the Committee knew how a disruption of the food distribution system
affects the price and availability of food here. She said that addressing this question requires the
City of Cambridge to set up their systems to handle larger issues with scale, and consider the
intersections between Cambridge and larger area.
Mr. Wineman offered to break down the stages of community impact as: 1) Acute events;
2) gradual, long-term events; and 3) gradual events that become acute.
Mr. Kelley commented that when we look at stresses to a community, economic collapse
is just as likely as environmental events. He stated that being resilient to one event is likely to
help prepare for another and we should not overly focus on specific challenges but look for
broader capacity building.
Mr. Kim said that the two universities have systems for attacks or shootings on campus,
and asked if the City had similar programs for sharing information.
Mr. Kelley responded by saying that there were systems, provided by a vendor, but he
didn’t think they were well adapted at responding to traumatic community events.
Ms. Kubik stressed that in order to build a robust communication network, one must
identify the weakest populations, and those furthest removed from current communication
systems, and then adapt programs to address their needs and abilities. During Sandy, such
individuals were the most difficult to communicate with, she noted, and response to those
communities was slower. She asked the Committee to start with systems that cater to those weak
populations, and then build up from there.
Mr. Wineman asked whether the Committee should look at a regional approach when
exploring its mission, by having some communication between Somerville, Boston, etc. He also
wanted to know whether the Committee could include in its scope an initiative to communicate
with a peer city to discuss how they are planning resiliency.
Mr. Kelley stated that finding such peer cities was a major goal that he envisioned for the
Committee.
Mr. Seidel asked if developing resiliency should be specifically related to environmental
events.
Mr. Kelley responded in the negative, and referred to earlier examples of economic
collapse, and noted that an event could be resource based, etc.
Mr. Seidel concurred, and stated that for the Committee to come out solely looking at
environmental events would unduly limit its scope.
Committee Goals
Mr. Durbin asked the group to think about individuals and entities which the Committee
might like to invite to future meetings. Members of the committee offered the following:
Cambridge DPW, Department of Public Health, MIT, Harvard, National Guard, DCR, MBTA,
Natural Emergency Response groups, someone from the local food system, and Hospitals.
Members agreed that after formed, the Committee should seek to fill in demographic omissions
of representation by inviting various communities to provide input.
Mr. Seidel asked if the Committee could dedicate a meeting to infrastructure in the
community, and whether the group could take field trips.
Mr. Kelley responded that the Committee is encouraged to come up with places to visit.

Committee Chair Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:36 and thanked everyone for coming,
and for their continued interest in resiliency planning, particularly on a local level. He invited the
members to introduce themselves.
Ms. Andujar stated that she is a longtime community organizer and housing activist, and is now
retired. She has experience working to develop youth radio and television productions. She has
resided in Cambridge for over 25 years.
Ms. Holloway is a lifelong Cambridge resident who is interested in neighborhood creation, what
it means to be resilient, and how we might imagine resiliency in the community in a similar way
to how we discuss a resilient body. She had never set foot in City Hall previously, and
appreciated the opportunity to participate.
Mr. Durbin introduced himself as a transplant to the area from rural Ohio.
Mr. Aidinoff just moved back to Cambridge after working in other cities including, Washington,
D.C., where worked on a range of resiliency issues in office of the Vice President. He has worked
on gun control issues and helping constituencies to look at resiliency in different ways. As a
Ph.D. candidate at MIT, he is interested in how institutions make decisions.
Ms. Harrison has been a resident of Cambridge for the past 10 years, and is working toward
finishing her Ph.D. in the History of Science at Harvard. She also received a Master’s degree in
Public Health from Harvard. She is interested in community resiliency on a global level, and
connecting people across social and demographic contexts. She reminded the group to ask what is
particular about specific communities. She lived in NYC for 5 and ½ years, and helped to
organize communities in the East Village.
Mr. Seidel is an urban planner by training, and former Cambridge City Councillor.
Ms. Dillard is an architect by training, and has experience designing mobile home parks and
temporary homes for persons displaced by disasters.
Mr. Dmytryk is a North Cambridge resident with an interest in cultural anthropology. His
previous experiences include working with refugees, human rights organizations, and tech
companies. He is a member of Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities.

Mr. Spears runs his family’s funeral home in the Cambridgeport neighborhood, and has
experience in public media.

Mr. Kelley thanked everyone for their interest and service to the Committee, but noted that the
group was not as diverse as could be hoped, citing that filling up a committee is more difficult
than anticipated. He invited the group to acknowledge gaps in representation frankly so that they
may be addressed and intentionally included in relevant conversations.
He hope that by the end of the meeting the Committee would have an idea of its structure,
including selecting a Vice Chair in the event he is unable to attend, and consider how it might
think of Mr. Durbin’s role for the group. He reviewed the goals of the agenda with the members,
and stated that while the Committee is not a public body in the larger sense, he hoped to be open
when possible. In particular, he invited the group think broadly about who they would like to
invite to address the members in a 30 to 40 minutes format. He considered the mission of the
Committee to learn from other places, but was not interested in telling other places what to do.
Mr. Kelley cautioned that there may be some tenderness if the Committee’s findings are critical
of other organizations or offices, but that there is a natural hole between people and the various
agencies and the organizations that support them. He wanted to address those holes. He
concluded by saying that he wanted members to strain their thoughts academically, and by doing
so making our city stronger by bringing new ideas to the City.
Mr. Durbin led the Committee in a brief ice-breaker.
Mr. Roger entered and asked forgiveness for being tardy. He introduced himself as an expert in
climatology, and that his previous work included the first urban heat island study of Dublin,
Ireland. He is currently involved in technology security, and is interested in the effects of heat on
community.
Mr. Kelley briefly reviewed open meeting law considerations. He outlined that Mr. Durbin would
take minutes, and send them out to members. He asked that edits to minutes be made in track
changes if possible, then all edits would be collected and compiled. Mr. Durbin would then send
out final minutes for approval at the next meeting.
Mr. Seidel moved to accept the March minutes, and they were adopted by the vote of the
Committee.
Mr. Kelley asked that if a member could not attend that they please read the minutes ahead of
time. If they came across topics which the group might want to explore, members should feel
comfortable to introduce them to the group, such as heat resistant trees. He stated that experts
tend to overestimate how much their data trickles down, and the Committee should try to
introduce information that a lay person could engage. He stated that at the end of the meeting he
will open the One Note file he has set up to discuss how the group can communicate with each
other, and said that the group should be super porous. The Committee has a Facebook page,
Twitter account, and that he and Mr. Durbin are working with the city to see what an appropriate
webpage would look like. He said the Committee has a budget to invite speakers, have field trips
to dams for example, but if they have ideas about who we might invite or where we might go to
learn more about resiliency in Cambridge they are invited to relay them to the group.

Mr. Wineman is a native of Cambridgeport, and helped to form the neighborhood group
Greenport to address climate change at local level about 10 years ago. He is a writer and retired
mental health professional.

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley replied that the Committee could definitely look at other locations, they just need to
meet in public spaces.
Mr. Rogers stated that the Committee should try to read up on the wealth of research in climate
and resiliency out there to help its work. He said there is a lot of good research being produced by
universities on even the Master’s thesis level around cities tracking tree growth, shade, etc., that
make up very interesting reading. Other research on materials construction, architecture, and how
certain materials absorb heat differentially might also be useful.
Mr. Kelley encourage the group to share their various expertise—whether it include building
construction, end of life services, or a knowledge of a particular community.
Mr. Kelley asked the Committee to brainstorm around the meaning of resiliency, what are its
principles.
Mr. Rogers stated that resiliency means different things to different people depending on where
they live, what stage of life they were in, and their lifestyle. If a person lived in a flood zone, for
example, they might just think about water and rank resiliency to flooding higher than other
considerations.
Mr. Seidel thought the group should take a boat trip on the Charles to gain a different perspective
on the city.
Ms. Harrison defined resiliency as the ability to return to an original form, and the ability to
regain function, at least as good as it was before.
Mr. Dmytryk expanded on that idea to say that in psychological theories, resiliency means both
the ability to recover, but also to achieve a better state.
Ms. Holloway read selections from a Strozzi Institute document (Attachment A) on somatics and
trauma, and invited the group to explore how the studies related to the body might be applicable
on a municipal level.
Mr. Wineman pointed to an important distinction between definitions of resilience as preparation,
as capacity and ability to deal with disruptive events, and resiliency as ability to recover from
events. It’s both physical and emotional. In the preparatory stage of resiliency, building
redundancy into our structures and public spaces is a key component. A related concept is
brittleness: A food system that relies on CA, on food systems that are thousands of miles away,
that’s brittle as opposed to a food system which has multiple local sources.
Ms. Andujar said that such conversations were very abstract for her, and that she needed to
connect it to human beings, to focus on safety and dignity. She said the Committee should remain
focused on community, and ask are we really a community? When talking about resilient
neighborhoods, does that include older neighborhoods? Regarding neighborhood resiliency, what
are the communities we are talking about? Who are the residents?

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Holloway said it would be interesting to rotate meeting locations in different neighborhoods
throughout the city to engage more people. It might also allow members to better gauge the needs
and feel of the connected communities.

2.2.c

The Committee brainstormed principles and questions of resiliency for their continued work, they
were:







Concrete/discrete events vs. long term systemic events
Equitable response
Developing a narrative to help communities cope and understand preparatory measures,
and ongoing events
Placing resiliency in the contexts of human scope, infrastructure, and training
Providing meaningful content in communications that can flow from officials to the
public, through the “grapevine” if necessary
Awareness of the likelihood to overestimate/underestimate preparedness and the impact
of events

Ms. Harrison added that another word to consider is imagination, as an important topic to explore
for the Committee. As a theme, imagination shows up in studies frequently, communities often
underestimate their ability to recover from events, but when a catastrophe occurs, communities
often find the resources to build back.
Mr. Seidel asked the group to consider how people define bad events. If one is used to low
frequency of events, then even something minor can seem magnified as a big event. So when
does one get to the level of a traumatic event. He hoped the city would consider resiliency as
procedural, systemic and connected to training and the ability to react to events via a plan so that
people and officials respond automatically during impact events.
Mr. Rogers asked what connections the group should categorize between different groups in
communities, and explained that different events can stress different connections and
communities, but also pull people together along similar lines. A disaster could be heat wave or a
storm, but it will activate different people in a community to separate responses. Who are the
connectors? Who in his area is connected to them? What happens in a disaster?
Mr. Wineman thought that it would be helpful for the Committee to come up with scenarios to
address. He said the real question is if it’s over 100F for 9 straight days, who is going to be
impacted? How is city going to respond, how are neighborhoods going to respond?
Mr. Kelley asked the Committee to each give an example of an impact event that they could work
to address.
Ms. Holloway asked if the Committee could talk about mass shootings, and said that she thought
they should.
Mr. Kelley responded that as a City, we are spending a lot of money on school building redesign
to increase security, so he thought it was an appropriate topic.
Ms. Dillard affirmed Mr. Kelley’s observation, and related that her architect firm was often asked
to re-address security issues when a building is being redesigned.

Page 11 of 101
Packet Pg. 62

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Dillard said that both the abstract and community were connected, if one community is
coping well next to one that isn’t, then boundaries can be obstructive to building resiliency.
Buildings, foods, finances, are all connected, and so it seems weird to construct arbitrary
boundaries.

2.2.c

Ms. Andujar noted that if you overdesign for things you can hurt others. Information is key.

Water Supply: Contamination of the water supply, as happened in Flint, or a rationing of
potable water
Shootings: Whether in Cambridge or outside, what are the family connections?
Communicable diseases/viruses: mosquito borne diseases like zika, dengue, yellow fever,
or chikungunya travel in unique ways, and may effect populations differently based on
their jobs, recreational activities, and prolonged exposure to the outdoors. Ebola provided
a different sort of scare last year.
Infrastructure decay: potholes, snow removal, bridges
Miscellaneous evenst: tree falling over
Power outage/Electricity supply: Who will be effected? How?
Flooding: Mystic watershed, what happens during the 100 year flood?
Crime
Food shortages: Drought? Most stores only have a three day cushion of supplies and
possibly less for specialty diets.
Heat waves: How do citizens remain hydrated? 2016 is already breaking heat records,
though the local variability of weather may help people to ignore the longer term trend of
dangerous heat in their local area.
Cold snaps
Opioid Use/Suicides
Income inequality

Mr. Spears said that traumatic events might transcend both neighborhood and even city
boundaries, and gave the example of a local shooting. Even though the shooting occurred across
the Charles, the repercussions of that event were felt in Cambridge, and in the community to
which the victim belonged.
Mr. Seidel said that there is a point in which one is over designing for one event, and not
addressing something else.
Mr. Spears said that during impact events, people need a central place to get information. CCTV
could have an alert, he said, or the City could get the information out through the website. A
stress increaser is that information often lags way behind an event. Need a place for people to find
information quickly.
Ms. Andujar asked about the citizens who may not have constant access to internet, or what
happens when the electricity is out?
Mr. Aidinoff stated that it was worth pursuing the question about how different traumas have
distinct impacts and bring forth different communities. Different events bring people together.
Groups communicate within themselves. Parents come together at schools, dog walkers come
together at parks. Universities are good at protecting the people on the inside of their gates, but
how does that protection affect the people just on the other side.
Mr. Rogers said that communications is typically the easiest part of the equation. Actually
dealing with the “event” in the community is going to be hard. Discovering what links exist

Page 12 of 101
Packet Pg. 63

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

The Committee members went around and each gave an impact event, or communal trauma that
they were concerned about, and which the group might address.

2.2.c

within the community, and gauging how strong they are—whether schools or churches have
stronger ties—is important to developing a response.

Ms. Andujar added that the universities also act as gate keepers of information for their
population. Speaking of the MIT community, Cambridge is in large part a transient community
with large percentage of students and commuters. That changes the way information permeates a
neighborhood and the value that certain data points are given.
Mr. Rogers said that the group should also consider the timeframe of events. What are the most
destructive events on the short term, long term? What are we trying to be resilient to?
Mr. Wineman noted that we can only go so far with abstractions. We need some scenarios like a
heat wave. Who will respond? How will the City respond?
Ms. Harrison stated that it was really important to address the needs of each community, to talk
across their different response needs, to reach an equitable response.
Mr. Aidinoff encouraged the Committee to consider the way trauma can remain past certain
events, and how because of media coverage everyone can play witness to a traumatic event for an
indefinite amount of time. How can resiliency respond to these events which are harder to
address? He asked what the schedule was for addressing certain events, the five day, week, and
year transition to addressing those problems. He asked how we can identify or create known
scenarios to address unknown problems, to use what we know to inform what we do when we
don’t know. What’s the narrative?
Mr. Seidel said that in a school shooting scenario, there will be parents seeking information, and
different people releasing information, but the information flow as an event is happening is not
managed. The community’s likelihood to overestimate and event an underestimate an event is not
well understood. Also, we act in a system and understanding our various “roles” in that system is
important—who is supposed to, and will do what and when?
Mr. Spears affirmed that how information is spread is also important, with Twitter alerts, people
in other states can get information before local officials. He said that this lateral spread happens
all the time. A victim of a shooting might live in one place, but their family is in the city, their coworkers. They might have moved out of Cambridge, but the affect is still felt in Cambridge.
Mr. Kelley asked the Committee to shift gears, and to think upon all the events that had been
addressed, and to come up with ways to frame the ongoing discussion of how should Cambridge
address resiliency?
The Committee gave the following observations:
What are resilient aspects of the neighborhood?
 Resiliency should be nested in several layers, starting with the neighborhood level,
moving up to the community level, and finally considering the citywide level. Includes
support networks of churches, ethnic communities and even far-reaching networks such
as Go Fund Me.

Page 13 of 101
Packet Pg. 64

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Holloway thought that the Committee should challenge itself to make information as
accessible as possible, and also to ask itself who defines the necessary information. Who are the
gate keepers of information? Be aware, and careful of the narrative we are falling into.



A strong local government is imperative to formulating a cohesive response, everyone
should know who to call, where to get certain information during impact events. This
includes mutual aid, support and structures between governments.
City structures, both real and personal, should be adaptable and network based, formed
along communal lines, creating a culture of “Checking-in: Do you need anything”
between neighbors
Infrastructure systems should be “hearty,” and shock-resistant
During all types of events and with various impact potentials, there needs to be
intentional outreach from the City. People need to feel that they are well informed.
Multidirectional communication between government and neighborhood groups
Communities should have an inventory of resources which neighbors can access,
including transients. People need to know about these resiliency resources and also how
to access them.
Being able to use the street whenever you want and be fine, feeling safe from all threats
in your community.
The end result should be vibrancy, the goal is to have healthy growth after an impact
event rather than mere survival

Mr. Wineman thought that certain people gifted with leadership skills or initiative could have an
outsized impact in communities, and it may be worthwhile identifying such people. After the
Monson tornado, he recalled that there were just a couple of people that coordinated blankets and
other concrete resources that were needed.
Ms. Harrison said that the Committee should concentrate on developing an inventory of resources
that Cambridge has that other communities may not.
Mr. Kelley asked the Committee to identify industries and sectors of interest to invite speakers
from for the next four meetings. He explained that his vision of what an outside speaker might
provide to the group, such as the Cambridge Public Health Director for example, is to explain
how they address resiliency, which might mean social worker contractors for a traumatic events.
The group would listen for a while, and then ask questions of the expert.
Mr. Aidinoff hoped that it was the Committee’s goal to produce something that is maximally
useful to the City and community, and said that perhaps the group should go out and look at what
other peer cities are doing in terms of resiliency.
Mr. Kelley agrees, but said finding cities with examples comparable to Cambridge will be
difficult, but that the Committee should be looking.
Mr. Aidinoff asked what document the Committee would produce at the end of the year.
Mr. Kelley responded that the Committee will give the Mayor a report at the conclusion of the
process, it will have an appendix in it, may have a bunch of links, which the Committee can
present to the City Council. The report will have good recommendations for city investments, and
maybe things the City is not hitting on the mark. The Committee is asked to cover a very broad
range of activities, but he said that if all we’ve done is talk, then we will not have been very
helpful to the city.

Ms. Harrison returned to the groups of people the Committee might invite to talk, and said that a
representative from all neighborhoods would be beneficial.

Mr. Kelley suggested the drafters of Cambridge’s Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment to
speak.
The Committee agreed that it would invite a representative from CDD to speak at the next
meeting.
Mr. Seidel stated his concern that if the Committee invited CCVA people in, then they run the
risk of framing the problem in terms of what the City already knows, and not moving the
conversation forward.
The Committee agreed that a representative of Cambridge’s Public Health Department would be
invited to the June meeting, and someone able to talk about the food supply to its July meeting.
An expert on Cambridge’s water supply was suggested as a potential speaker for the August
meeting.
Mr. Seidel said that the Committee should seek its niche in places that are not already covered.
There was general consensus that the Committee’s work should not include redoing work that has
already been done.
Mr. Wineman said that he hoped to get an assessment from the CDD representatives of existing
capacities in neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelley introduced the last order of business which was to select an Executive Assistant to the
Committee to take notes and organize meetings. Mr. Durbin was selected.
Mr. Kelley closed the meeting at 8:45 p.m. and thanked Committee members for their time.

Public present:

Sam Corda, Water Department

Mr. Kelley opened the meeting and asked for approval to suspend the order of business to allow
Sam Corda from the Cambridge Water Department to present first and answer questions. The
motion received unanimous consent.
Mr. Corda presented on the City’s water infrastructure and systems:
 Fresh Pond stores about 32 million gallons of water for the city, and 42 inch pipes
distribute the water throughout Cambridge, which does require many pumps because the
city is mostly level.
 The City uses on average 12.5 million gallons of water every day, and 5 billion gallons
per year. The Water Department does not provide water to other municipalities.
 The current operating system was implemented in March 2001, though the EPA and other
regulatory agencies continue to increase the list of bacteria and other contingents to
monitor and generate new best-practices.
 With the Flint disaster still on the public’s mind, lead contamination has become a focus
of concern, but Cambridge has never exceeded the lead limit since testing began in 1991.
 The City staffs a lab of microbiologists which handles most of the tests for bio-agents and
microbes.
 Twelve gauging stations are dispersed throughout the watershed that feeds into
Cambridge’s reservoirs to measure flow, conductance, and purity. These are used by
governmental agencies to publish reports on the region.
 Since 2001, systems have been in place to detect foreign agents in the water from a
potential terrorist attack.
 Ozone (O3) is used as a disinfectant for bacteria growth, and this can be charged to
sterilize the water. Chlorine is another disinfectant used, as well as other compounds
which remain stable throughout the distribution system to maintain cleanliness of the
water.
 Ozone is a primary disinfectant for the water, which is filtered through carbon, sand, and
other systems.
Resiliency and the Water Department
 In early 2000s, the department secured funds to conduct vulnerability assessments for the
treatment facility, and the whole system has been evaluated.
 A strength of Cambridge’s water supply system is the great extent of flexibility to change
sources depending on the purity of water, drought, need, etc.

Particularly with watersheds near highways, a potential for spills into the water supply
remains a persistent concern. These areas have several systems in place to monitor or
shut off supply in the event of a spill, even for a month or two to allow clean up and
mitigation.
Hobbs Brook is the largest reservoir source of water for Cambridge, and Fresh Pond is
the second.
Two separate electrical sources power the water facility. There is a backup generator, but
it is not enough to power facility.
Water usage changes through the seasons, with as much as 20 million gallons per day in
summer, and from 10-11 million gallons in the winter months.
As part of early 2000s and ongoing assessments, several areas around Water Department
facilities have been identified to “harden,” or actively upgrade to prevent damage or
attack. The treatment facility has good security, with card access, video surveillance, ID
services, and gating to block unauthorized personnel. Standoff distances around
established around the treatment plant to prevent parking directly next to facility. Blast
film is installed on all external windows.
The facility is manned 24 hours a day to report suspicious activity.
Even in the event of malicious activity, it would be very difficult to affect the entire
distribution area.
Cyber-attacks are prevented as the facility is not actively connected to the internet, it has
its own internal system.
The Water Department has recently completed drought management planning, mimicked
several storms, evaporation, etc. to gauge potential impacts to the water supply.
Cambridge has a 9 month capacity if it never rained after the Fresh Pond reservoir were
full, though such scenarios would be extremely rare. Hobbs Brook was low after this past
winter, though not historically so, but after spring rains its up to 80-90 percent capacity.
The newest innovations in the department have been to develop and use complex
modeling systems to gauge precipitation, evaporation, use, etc. to help the department
make decisions.
Main message is that the water system has a lot of flexibility to adapt to events, weather
patterns and conditions, etc.
Future resiliency planning has identified the need to expand redundancy in systems,
particularly around energy. The City recently received a grant from the state to fund a
battery backup system to allow 1-2 hour capacity.
FY17 budget appropriation of $50,000 to see if there is anything facility-specific to
improve operations in the event of flooding. Are currently trying to understand what
future impacts to supply might be if climate change continues as predicted.
A major concern during a historic flooding event is the potential for sewage to enter the
water system after overload of drainage in other municipalities that intersect with the
watershed.

Mr. Corda opened the floor to questions.
Ms. Andujar asked why Water Department quality reports regularly list contaminants, but not
water born parasites?
Mr. Corda responded that all requirements for monitoring and reporting have been met, with no
discovery of parasites. The persistently good track record reduces reporting requirements.
Schools get tested every year, and samples of each school are taken, though not necessarily every
single bubbler. He stated that with the Flint lead scare, school water sources have been examined,

Page 18 of 101
Packet Pg. 69

2.2.c

Ms. Gubik asked whether the heavy snow season of 2014-15 put any stress on the system.
Mr. Corda responded that even though the area experienced record snowfall, the system was not
taxed in the least. Even in the event that the reservoirs collect too much water, the department can
divert or dump excess from the Stony Brook reservoir into the Charles River.
Mr. Spears recalled an event about 7 years ago when a valve broke and several communities in
the Boston Metro area were without water, what happened?
Mr. Corda explained that the failure occurred with a Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
(MWRA) pipe. One of the flanges split. Even during this event, however, Cambridge still had
water.
Mr. Wineman reflected that the system seems a model of redundancy. One potential threat he did
not hear voiced in terms of a contingency plan, however, was in the event of a regional extended
power outage how the department expected to ensure services. If such an extended regional
power outage occurred beyond the 2-3 days of water supply that is recommended for every home,
is there a plan?
Mr. Corda thought that there was indeed a plan for that. In the event of widespread outages,
natural gas can be used to power generators to keep the pumps going. The likelihood of an
extended outage is extremely unlikely, however, with all the backup systems built into the
MWRA and Cambridge’s own systems.
Mr. Wineman followed up with a question concerning the backup systems that are fossil fuel
based. Thinking medium- to long-term, when fossil fuels may not be sustainable or viable, are
there plans to replace those sources with renewable energy sources?
Mr. Corda responded that there are renewable sources being utilized, such as wind mills and solar
power plants, but it is unlikely that the department is going to be net-zero. We do want to increase
renewables, including hydro, but 100 percent is difficult at this point. The water treatment plant is
the biggest user of energy of all the city departments, even still, it has reduced consumption by 1
million kwh, or about 20 percent less that what they were using.
Mr. Seidel asked if Cambridge could live off of MWRA waters if necessary?
Mr. Corda responded yes, but it would just cost more. They don’t filter the water to the extent
that Cambridge does, though they do maintain the PH level so a switch would not cause extensive
corrosion. If all reservoirs were full, including the Quabbin, the MWRA has a 2-3 year capacity
of water.
Mr. Rogers asked if that was enough to take care of the California type of drought?

Page 19 of 101
Packet Pg. 70

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

but the department closely monitors PH levels to ensure they are maintained at a level that
prevents lead from leeching into the water. Pipes and surfaces in the home are typically the
primary sources of lead, not the water supply. In 2015, he explained, the lead level at the 54th
highest reading of 60 tests was 5pp billion, far less than the 15pp billion threshold. The success of
the lead abatement program that started in the 90s is a testament to the effectiveness of the
corrosion prevention program that keeps PH low.

2.2.c

Mr. Corda stated we was not sure as there are several circumstances specific to California that
exacerbated the situation: the drought there has been going on for a while, and many localities are
dependent upon the CO river for water, rather than reservoirs. The complex water laws of the
west also make comparisons difficult.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Rogers asked who was developing the climate models the Water Department was using.
Mr. Corda said that staff members were not experts on modeling software, and that developing
the models was hired out to experts, but he didn’t recall the names of the companies.
Mr. Dmytryk said that he was quite impressed by the work of the Water Department in trying to
understand the vulnerability and threats to the City’s water supply, and implementing the
necessary redundancy systems to address those concerns. He asked what are the biggest concerns
that the department has now?
Mr. Corda responded that rapidly adapting to increased regulations is probably the biggest
concern at this point from a departmental perspective, such as when certain processes or additives
are regulated against. Trihalomethanes, for example, were deemed carcinogenetic and required a
restructuring of policies and practices. Trihalomethanes have been reduced to about 10 percent of
their previous levels, hence ozone has become a much more important disinfectant. He said the
Water Department tests a barrage of elements, including caffeine, but they are all lower than
regulator standards.
Mr. Durbin asked what have been the major strain or stress events that Cambridge’s water system
has experienced in the past 20-30 years?
Mr. Corda said that the biggest concern is always testing for microbiological agents, for trace
elements. Back in the mid-90s, the department tested positive for a string of total coliform levels
that indicated a contamination, just an indicator, but it could mean a problem. In the end, the City
did not find a problem, but it was a very stressful time. The regulatory process has changed since
then.
Mr. Kelley asked if the City were to go to MWRA water, would that affect our industrial
processes?
Mr. Corda said that because the water is similar to Cambridge’s, industrial systems should not be
majorly affected. At the Harvard Steam generator plant, however, they need to know to plan and
implement effectively.
Mr. Seidel asked how the department thinks about wildlife and non-human use of water?
Mr. Corda responded that Mr. Seidel sets up a difficult scenario, because the department is
always juggling several concerns, such as trying to get stream flows back to pre-industiral levels.
He said that it’s very hard to maintain wildlife and habitat at Fresh Pond, but the main objective
of the department is to protect the water supply for humans, that is their main priority, their
prerogative. He said his priority is to provide the highest quality of water, using the least amount
of chemicals, the most efficiently.
Ms. Kubik asked if the Water Department is resilient to economic disruptions?

Page 20 of 101
Packet Pg. 71

2.2.c

Mr. Corda said that obviously systems need to be paid for, but it is a major priority of the city to
weather such disruptions. Just by tweaking the operations of the facility, he noted, we can save
money and increase efficiency.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley explained to the Committee that Cambridge purchased our water system in the 1850s
to provide our supply, a demonstration of how prudent thinking and planning can have a positive
impact in Cambridge for generations. He thanked Mr. Corda for taking time to speak with the
Committee and answer questions. He then turned the conversation to the Committee’s regular
order of business.
Mr. Kelley asked for a motion to approve the April minutes, and they were adopted.
Mr. Kelley told the committee that he and Mr. Durbin had met with a graphic recorder who
would like to demonstrate her skills to the Committee, listen to our CDD discussion and illustrate
the conversation. After that, the committee could decide whether to adopt her for other meetings.
She will volunteer for the June meeting, and then we can decide whether to invite her further. He
said there is a cost to her services, which the Committee could discuss.
Mr. Kelley informed the Committee that he would be sending out invitations to organize small
groups to get an idea of what specific interests members would like to pursue, so that they don’t
feel like their interests are being overlooked.
Ms. Holloway said that she has been in contact with Jose Alverez of Shaws to come speak to the
Committee, but the end of the month is not a very convenient time. She thought the Committee
should be able to break up to tackle certain issues.
Mr. Wineman added that he thought the Committee could have two presentations in one meeting.
Mr. Seidel stated that maybe a small group could start by just talking about the water department,
how do we digest the conversation and what take away should the group have?
Ms. Holloway responded that she did not think the Committee was an auditing body to judge the
water department, but that the gauge is resiliency and the Committee should be looking for those
criteria.
Mr. Rogers said that the Water Department was probably pretty good at responding to standard
catastrophes, but wondered how resilient is it to multiple accidents or events. We need to think
about the “what ifs,” and compounding situations.
Mr. Wineman responded in the affirmative. The next question for water is, if MWRA is the
contingency plan, how resilient is MWRA?
Mr. Rogers stated that when the Committee is looking at these types of resiliency issues, we are
studying this from the city perspective, but many of these issues are multi-city. One is only as
resilient as your neighbor, and if something happens there, and they are not prepared, your
resiliency is going to deplete very fast.
Mr. Seidel said the challenge is not how we compare to other system, how to take that
information and bring it to a neighborhood level. That is the “neighborhood-based resiliency”
part.

Page 21 of 101
Packet Pg. 72

2.2.c

Ms. Holloway asserted that that’s our test, right? How the Committee measures the spread of
information.

Mr. King asked if Somerville runs out of water, what happens to Cambridge?
Mr. Rogers said that’s the question.
Mr. King echoed what Tony said earlier: When most of the Boston Metro area ran out of water 7
years ago, and Cambridge still had water, what was the impact on the community? How did
people in Cambridge, on its fringe, who worked here, react?
Mr. Kelley brought up the reliance on the power system as a major concern here.
Mr. Wineman said that he was not even sure that that many events need to happen to trigger a
major crisis. As the MWRA outage seven year ago illustrates, if the water goes out when simply a
valve breaks, then that is just one event, but it would majorly cripple the City.
Mr. Kelley said that the Committee would get a tour of the dams that protect Cambridge against
storm water surges of the near future at some point. For the most part, however, it’s not like the
City is looking at permanent damage or displacement. Major events are possible to be sure, but
not catastrophic in the long term.
Mr. Seidel said that the one thing that experts don’t have is the regular pulse of the neighborhood.
Engineers know their trade, but not the neighborhoods. Somerville is just a step below Cambridge
for many systems, so they may not be the best city to compare with Cambridge. Cambridge is
always paying other communities to protect our own systems and projects. We just paid $25
million for the Green Line Extension even though there is not much line in the City.
Ms. Holloway said the Committee could do a year of disaster planning, but we need to have a
positive impact. She asked what the Committee is going to give to neighborhoods?
Mr. Rogers said that when their family lost our cat, someone recommended NextDoor and we
used it to find our cat. It could be a good tool in the future.
Mr. Kelley said that he’s talked with an App designer about designing a neighborhood site, but
NextDoor already has market penetration.
A question was generally adopted that perhaps the group should have a meeting on the NextDoor
technology.
Mr. Kelley told the members that he and Mr. Durbin are still working on the Committee’s
website, but funding it is not as easy as first thought. We are going to start a photo contest
through the summer. Since September is National Preparedness month, we should conclude the
contest at that time. We could catch what other people are thinking about in terms of climate
change and heat.
Ms. Holloway said that she felt like she might have joined the wrong committee. She didn’t think
the Committee was talking about climate change exclusively.

Mr. Rogers said that Mr. Corda is doing his job very well, but does he know what’s going on in
Somerville?

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley responded that the Committee is trying to be broad, but it is easy to fall into the rut of
just thinking climate change.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Wineman asked how much space does climate change has on this committee? His view is
that it’s a false distinction. Its not a useful distinction to talk about whether this is a resiliency or
climate change committee. Resiliency does not exist in a vacuum. When we talk about all these
issue, they are all aspects of climate change potentially. The impact of climate change is the very
reason of why resiliency is such an important issue to discuss.
Mr. Rogers said that most of the extremes that we are going to be faced with are going to be
caused by climate change. The water department is pretty set for non-extreme events. But how
are we preparing for extreme events?
Mr. Kelley said that, as broadly as possible, we need to think about resiliency, and not just
climate.
Mr. Seidel stated that we should not try to out expert the experts. We need to keep focused on the
people, on the neighborhood, and the response methods.
Mr. Wineman said that part of what he was hearing is that some members are not interested in
being on a committee that looks at all the bad things that may happen, but to provide concrete
solutions. What are the contingencies that we are putting positive things in place for?
Ms. Andujar said that she’s in a committee that is a neighborhood-based committee to address
extreme events. She’d like to feel that we have concrete information meaning that Cambridge is
trying to warn the people about things that are coming down the pipeline. There is a feeling that
the city knows what will happen, but that is not being communicated.
Mr. Rogers thought that making the city’s public services aware of the broader concerns from the
public that would be helpful.
Mr. King said the biggest challenge during crisis is usually communication. During major events,
cell phone towers are overloaded, which has downstream repercussions. There is now a plan
where the police will communicate in an emergency when cell phones fail.
Mr. Kelley asked from a communication standpoint, what can the water department do better to
communicate about school water safety, pharmaceuticals in the water, or backup of energy
services? If the average house is supposed to have a three-day supply of water, then the city
should probably have more.
Mr. Kelley redirected the conversation back to the photo contest portion. What is it that we are
talking about, and what is it that we are asking people to submit and participate in? As a contest,
what does preparedness look like? What does resiliency look like in your neighborhood?
Preparedness?
Mr. Rogers said that he would like every speaker that comes in here to talk about
communications, how they communicate with the public, and how they operate in the absence of
the internet, information, etc.

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman said that he thinks that what just happened illustrates two focuses for this
committee. Neighborhood resiliency has two dimensions: one has to do with how city systems
affect each neighborhood; the other is what is life like on the ground in the event of a catastrophic
event.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Rogers asked how the neighborhoods around Cambridge communicate separately to get and
relay information would be important to understand.
Mr. Kelley said we too often think that when we put information out on Twitter, we are covered
as far as communication goes, but often too many people are left out of the conversation. He
asked what’s the image/photo/GIF/ for what we need to be prepared for to demonstrate
resiliency? Both problem and solution. What’s the concept that they are trying to get across. Mr.
Rogers and Mr. Durbin were selected to work on contest.
Mr. Kelley brought the meeting to a close, and thanked the Committee for their time.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on NeighborhoodBased Resiliency

Members present:

Emily Harrison; Suni Dillard; Mark Aidinoff; Ethridge King; Steve
Wineman; Sonia Andujar; Gary Dmytryk; Craig Kelley, chair; Sam
Seidel

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

City Staff/Public:

Sam Lipson; John Boldec; Sheri Kennedy; Stewart Dash; Suzanne
Rasmussen; Kathy Watkins

Mr. Boldec started the discussion by talking about the City’s Climate Change Vulnerability
Assessment (CCVA) released last year. The second part has yet to be released. Going into the
assessment process, he stated the City acknowledged climate change was happening and was
going to get worse. Having a useful model is important because City planning is based on past
conditions, not the present, nor future. But it is the future that’s not stable. Having to deal with the
dynamism is going to be a planning challenge.
He continued to say that his office decided Cambridge needed a better understanding of what
climate change would look like locally. It really matters that you look at climate’s impact on the
local scale. He stressed that even under the best circumstances you are dealing with a lot of
uncertainty—it’s not as if science provides a concrete roadmap. Accordingly, the City
commissioned a CCVA based on several scenarios, and identified both social and infrastructure
vulnerabilities in the City. They looked at physical and social aspects, extreme heat, sea level rise
(SLR), precipitation and so forth.
Due to the high level of uncertainty, he stated the City didn’t want to predict what the future
would be, but instead decided to look at climate change in the form of “stress tests” to
Cambridge. What happens socially if we throw more water and heat into the city? The idea is not
so much to predict, but identify vulnerabilities. Things get much worse by 2070. A hundred year
flood is now 8.9” of rain in 24 hours, in 2030 it will be 10.2 inches and by 2070 it will be 11.7
inches. We will also go from 11 90 degree days a year to about 30 in 2030 and 40-40 in 2070
with dangerously hot days across the City.
Mr. Boldec continued that despite all uncertainties, we still needed data. We worked with
Catherine Hajos at a Texas university, who is prominent climate change modeler who provided
ranges within which the City worked. For precipitation, we took future rainfalls and tried to map
out where it would collect and flood. The City also worked with the MBTA to extend their sea
level rise models for the Red Line, the main artery for Cambridge.
His office took projections, and cataloged 500 physical assets, and then looked at social
environment and where these projections would make the biggest impact to help identify
vulnerabilities. For social vulnerabilities, his office looked at poverty, children under 5 years old,
low education level, language isolation, elderly populations, and elderly living alone.

June 28, 2016—795 Mass Ave, City Hall, Ackerman Room: 6:30 P.M.

2.2.c

The first part of the assessment was released in November 2011, second report coming out soon
(after 3 delays it is now scheduled to be released in September) on storm surge and sea level rise.

For the larger storms, it’s unlikely we will be able to store or divert our way out of the flooding
problem. “Living with water” is going to become life. There are lots of regional aspects to this
whole discussion.
He said people have trouble comprehending that the climate that they should adapt for is not the
climate that they grew up with, especially when it comes to heat even though we know it is
deadly. The city is not going to be able protect everyone, the community must get together to
build resiliency and protect each other.
Cambridge is nonetheless looking to harden physical and social aspects of the city. They are
looking at resilience at different scales: individual, building, neighborhood, citywide, and
regional. And we must pursue flexible strategies to cope with dynamic change, share
responsibilities for preparedness and resilience, and monitor changes in physical and social
environments.
Preparing Cambridge for the future will require organizing ad hoc focus groups to help the city
get reactions to ideas and projects, and vet approaches. Once we have a more solid set of ideas,
we will go out into the public and present the ideas and ask for critiques.
We decided not to form an official advisory board to guide the climate change preparedness, but
to allow Envision Cambridge to handle the project and process. The climate change preparedness
plan will be finalized after that process.
The Preparedness Plan is projected at 18 months. The Alewife Plan should be concluded by Dec.
2016. Second eastern part of the City neighborhood assessment by June 2017. And Complete full
plan by December 2017, when the Envision Plan will be completed.
The goal is to empower neighborhood groups to be the first responders to events. To help the
community and identify and organize networks, shelters, contingency plans, and Pre-ID people at
risk.
Mr. Kelley asked how CDD looks at neighborhoods and neighborhood specific resources and
response.
Ms. Andujar added that with multi-family houses and green infrastructure, what are the City’s
plans for existing structures and how they will be retrofitted.
Mr. Boldec responded that new developments are the easier part of the process, we can make new
guidelines and recommendations for the building process, putting important infrastructure up that
addresses resiliency issues. Existing infrastructure is the main challenge. By 2050, most of the
current housing stock will still be here. CDD is considering a Resiliency Audit to evaluate houses
with vulnerabilities to heat, or flooding, etc. He noted that the City was assessing its particular
vulnerabilities with the goal of figuring out how to finance addressing them.
Ms. Rasmussen shared that the City is exploring emerging strategies and building a brochure to
help people retro-fit their house to make it more resilient.

Page 26 of 101
Packet Pg. 77

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Many of the gravest flooding issues are based on models from 2040 sea level rise.

2.2.c

Mr. Boldec responded that they haven’t figured that out yet but they will have to work with
property owners. It is not clear how to back improvements into existing buildings.
Mr. Seidel stated that there is a high proportions of single family households. When we think
about preparedness, we prepare people for unexpected events. We constantly underestimate
people’s latent ability to remain resilient. The way we think about families getting over loss of
comforts and services, they often have contingency plans. We need to figure out what individuals
can do best, the city, neighborhoods, and what faith based groups can best accomplish.
Cathy: One thing we really focused on was elderly living alone.
Mr. Dmytryk asked if the City planned to empower neighbors to be first responders.
Mr. Boldec responded that he has seen where neighbors often plan ahead for their own people
and infrastructure, and mobilize people to care for each other. They might stockpile food, water,
or medicine. Neighbors develop their own communication systems. The City is not looking to
deliver those services, but help citizens to develop those networks, through faith-based
communities or other groups to encourage individual actions and behavioral changes. The better
individual preparation, the better overall preparedness. Broad ideas on how to empower
neighborhood groups.
Ms. Rasmussen noted that Cambridge is a transient City and that requires extra communication
efforts, especially with colleges and elderly people.
Mr. Dash gave some information on demographics in the city, noting that some parts of
Cambridge have gotten much more populated recently.
Mr. Dmytryk asked if the City maps the population that each neighborhood holds.
Mr. Dash responded in the affirmative.
Mr. Seidel related that often people are oriented to the social world around them. Whether they
know their neighbor’s name or not, he thinks about places of gathering: the market, barber shop,
etc. where people go for information. He thought the city should try to figure out how we can
make those places one stop places for networks. Bridging the first 72 hours of a crisis is crucial.
And pre-identifying disconnected, isolated people is difficult.
Ms. Rasmussen noted that having local charging stations was a main thing that came out of
Hurricane Shady. Pre-identifying people who are not connected. There are a lot of people who do
not want to be on a list and they will be the hardest to identify in real time. It is important to have
plans for buildings and families.
Ms. Watkins said a major priority is ensuring business continuity through stressful events. If
employees can’t get to the store to open and stock, for example, then people can’t get their food.
And some people do not even own cars to compensate for lack of working public transit. “Can
you get around” data is reflected in journey to work information.

Ms. Harrison asked CDD staff to elaborate on what they think about when discussing individual
responsibility vs. collective responsibilities, especially for people who are not property owners,
who are tenants or in high turn over rates.

2.2.c

Mr. Dash said that on a smaller, more personal scale, people still need to plan ahead. If there is
going to be two hot days or more, you need to start being aware of your own vulnerability and
those of your neighbors.

Mr. Seidel shared that in an age when many people get medicine through mail, some impacted
cities had to set up pharmacists in public places to get people their medication, such as happened
in Hurricane Sandy.
Mr. Bolduc said that the ability to recover from an impact is important and that impacts can vary.
Ms. Rasmussen talked about the importance of business continuity for money and also supplies.
Small business can do if they have they two weeks of no business.
Mr. Dash stated that heat could really string together as a crisis anytime and we need to move
away from business as usual and become more alert.
Mr. Kelley turned the conversation to how the Committee wanted to define neighborhoods for its
purposes, and stated that he preferred that the group use the city’s definition of neighborhoods.
He asked that the Committee adopt those definition by consent of the majority.
The Committee approved the motion.
Ms. Harrison added that the Committee still needed to think about how neighborhoods blur, and
cross over.
Mr. Kelley then turned the conversation to the matter of adopting a working definition of
“resiliency” for the Committee’s purposes. He stated that he was recently at a talk with Boston’s
Resiliency Officer Dr. Martin, and listened to her definitions which looked closely at how certain
events impacted communities differently. Particularly, her definition was attuned to how minority
groups struggled to overcome stressful events with the same ease of other groups due to lack of
resources and isolation.
Mr. Durbin gave some context to the various definitions of “resiliency” that he had pulled from
various sources, including San Francisco, 100 Resilient Cities, Louis D. Brandeis, and Google’s
App development guide.
Mr. Wineman asserted that the reference to “grow” contained in the 100 Resilient Cities’
definition was problematic and didn’t resonate with him, but what stuck out more is to adapt no
matter what happens. He said we also need to recognize our limits. If the shoreline moves 10
miles west, Cambridge can’t adapt. It’s delusional to say “adapt no matter what.” He said that he
heard on news today that the world faces a helium shortage, but a deposit was recently
discovered, and the attitude immediate changed to: Now we are saved! The interviewer did not
ask how long the find would last, nor did the scientist interviewed. In our conception of
resilience, it is important to incorporate realistic limits, both in terms of the factors that can cause
need for resilience, and how much it can accomplish.

Ms. Rasmussen said that cooling centers are being considered by the City, but you can’t stay in a
cooling center for two months.

2.2.c

Mr. King expressed that he considered a slight difference in that approach. If the city is flooded
and people have to move, okay, but adapt does not mean exist where the city is currently
positioned.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley shared that he didn’t even mention climate change in the email to CDD, and yet that
took up a large portion of their presentation, as if to underscore the importance that this particular
challenge poses to Cambridge.
The Committee adopted the following definition of resiliency:
Resilience describes the capacity of individuals, neighborhoods, institutions, businesses, and
systems within a city to equitably survive and adapt to persistent changes, chronic stresses,
and acute shocks.
Mr. Kelley recognized the importance of bringing the Public Health Department to a future
Committee meeting, and said that the Department of Public Works would be at the next meeting.
The meeting was adjourned.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on NeighborhoodBased Resiliency

Members present:

Suni Dillard; Gary Dmytryk; Craig Kelley, Chair; Ethridge King, Vice
Chair; Sam Seidel; Tony Spears; Steve Wineman

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

City Staff/Public:

Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of DPW; Kathy Watkins, City Engineer

Mr. Kelley called the meeting to order and introduced Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works, and Kathy Watkins, Assistant Commissioner for Engineering, and
asked the members to briefly introduce themselves.
Mr. O’Riordan began by saying that the work that has been done thus far to prepare Cambridge
for climate change results from a collaborative effort across various City departments, especially
Public Safety, Department of Public Health, Community Development and the Water
Department, as their infrastructure frequently requires inclusion on a long term planning scale.
He said that he was not going to repeat Mr. Bolduc’s presentation at the June meeting, but instead
would move forward on presenting a preparedness plan to show the City’s thinking on emergency
planning and how various departments fit into that planning.
Mr. Kelley commented that he wanted the City to stress public outreach on their preparedness
plans, such as with the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment (CCVA) and other work done
by the City.
Mr. O’Riordan stated that as we begin to think about resiliency now, it should be much more
community-based as opposed to the previous work which has been science-based, and he
underscored the need to include neighborhood discussions. In terms of climate change
phenomena, he continued, heat and rain fall will become much more problematic on a smaller
timescale. The probability of problematic rain fall is much higher for the City, whereas sea level
rise and storm surge predictors see major problems only after 2050, especially in the Alewife
watershed. Heat waves and indoor air quality issues are much more current concerns, particularly
for isolated populations like residents with special needs, children, and the elderly.
Mr. Kelley asked why indoor air quality was of concern, and how heat affected air quality.
Mr. O’Riordan answered that for elderly and other at risk population in particular, the lack of
mobility means less access to fresh air and inability to move to cooler areas during the day.
Ms. Watkins added that heat is directly tied to air quality issues.
Mr. Seidel asked whether heat having a compounding effect on air quality is a building materials
issue or behavioral?

2.2.c

These same populations are often effected by power outages caused by storms or heat, he
continued. The suspension of MBTA services last winter disproportionally impacted residents in
some income brackets more than others. In that instance, the day to day economic loss would be a
major contributor to a reduction in the economic welfare in a community, rather than the
destruction itself. Vulnerabilities, from energy to transit to flooding, increase over time. A big
rainfall flood in 1996 shut down Kenmore Square for 6 months. Aging regional systems are also
more susceptible to damage or failure as time goes on.
Resiliency is looked at at three levels:
Building Scale- homes, housing complexes, work spaces, etc.
Community Level- social cohesion, systems, shelter & cooling facilities, etc.
Regional Level- Watershed flood management, dam management & reconstruction (our
dams will be too small by 207)
Mr. O’Riordan outlined several categories for attention in drafting a resiliency plan including: 1)
building scale; 2) regional scale; 3) the neighborhood scale; 4) offices; 5) municipal facilities; 6)
critical service facilities; and finally 7) social cohesion systems.
If we think about Hurricane Katrina, he said, we see that social cohesion completely broke down.
And while food and water are important, access to emergency or cooling services are critical to
the response of similar events.
Mr. O’Riordan explained that in terms of vulnerabilities at the building scale, we identify
structures that are subject to flooding. Age and construction type of building are also relevant.
The older the building, the greater the potential for weather-related impact. Many of Cambridge’s
older homes still burn oil to heat their home, and thus the fuel-type residents use must also be
taken into account. In addition to disruptions in oil supply that snowstorms may cause, oil
shortages or economic upheaval can threaten access. Air Conditioning is another factor,
especially relevant if people are told to “Shelter in Place.” As another example of high priority
infrastructure, he continued, we are very dependent on the internet now, and the City is
considering what happens when that goes down. A major challenge for City staff is anticipating
and understanding how the same event impacts communities differently and how people with
disabilities such as mobility impairment may face special challenges.
Mr. Seidel asked whether the City graded buildings on susceptibility to various climate
eventualities.
Mr. O’Riordan answered that such a grading would not be a responsibility of DPW, but that
perhaps other departments had something equivalent.
Ms. Watkins added that newly constructed buildings and systems are indeed evaluated: can they
generate power, keep community cool, pool resources to serve the majority of people, etc.
Mr. O’Riordan said that these criteria exist for municipal buildings, which are judged by the same
standards. Certain other building codes apply uniformly to homeowners, large buildings, and city
buildings.

Page 31 of 101
Packet Pg. 82

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. O’Riordan replied that both contribute. For low-income individuals, air conditioning and
filtering is not widespread and where present, it is often not as efficient as it is in higher-income
homes. The vulnerability of these communities is observable, he said, as extended heat waves are
proven killers in other cities such as Chicago.

Mr. O’Riordan continued by saying that at the community scale, there is a long history of certain
neighborhoods being impacted by flooding and that strains the capacity of specific parts of our
drainage systems. Certain areas in our cities are more susceptible to heat island effects as well,
such as the Concord Ave area south of Alewife where there are no trees, and where the ground is
in excess of 80 percent impervious to rain water. Complications around tree monoculture also
contribute to heat island effect. And lack of shelters is a factor.
Mr. Kelley said that in terms of heat island effects, he thoughts of it as mainly impacting residents
that simply can’t cool down. But the areas surrounding Alewife is commercial, and so he asked
what the specific impact is if not to residents.
Mr. O’Riordan observed that this area continues to become more residential.
Mr. Kelley said that he never thought about heat’s impact on workplaces.
Mr. Wineman asked whether heat island effects were more localized or if they migrated. He
noted that one side of the Alewife area is mostly residential. He asked the extent that heat islands
effect adjoining areas.
Mr. O’Riordan said that while he was not sure, he though it likely that there is an impact.
Ms. Dillard interjected that there are studies that definitely show an impact that radiates away
from heat island areas.
Mr. O’Riordan stated that the heat island effect is especially observed around the MIT area,
which has very few trees.
Mr. Dmytryk asked how hot such areas might get.
Mr. O’Riordan answered that heat projection for these areas are available on the Community
Development Department website and in the CCVA.
He returned to his theme and addressed the community scale of events. At this level, he said, we
are mainly talking about isolated communities with no access to other support systems within the
City.
Mr. O’Riordan continued that the management of the Alewife watershed, 2 square miles of which
lay in Cambridge, is of major concern to the City. Cambridge has regulations on runoff and
development, but that does not apply in our neighboring communities. Of further worry, he went
on, is that much of the dam infrastructure that protect our communities will be ineffectual after
2050. The dams that protect Cambridge will continue to provide such protection from storm surge
events (seaward side) until approximately 2045-2050 at the Amelia Earhart Dam on the Mystic,
when it will be flanked during the 1% surge event (overtopped by 2055-2060 by the 1% surge
event), and specific to the Charles River Dam 2055-2060 when it would be flanked by a 1% surge
event, and 2065 when it would be both flanked and overtopped by a surge event. And there are no
state standards for flood management outside of a flood plain and Cambridge’s rules about
retaining water on property are fairly unique.

2.2.c

2.2.c

Mr. O’Riordan responded that we may indeed be overly-optimistic, but the City is using the most
up-to-date scientific data available to build its models and will revisit the data regularly. What we
are planning for in this regard includes the proximate, because long-term models may indeed
prove to be inaccurate.
DPW takes responsibility for preparedness at the building scale, he said, and has undertaken to
build resiliency plan across all municipal buildings looking at flood protection, standby power
generation, how to island the most critical facilities, reducing the energy demand of our buildings,
and making them more efficient. Our Water Department is of chief concern, and must be ready to
withstand all foreseeable events. Plus the City needs to provide resources to shelters and cooling
centers.
Ms. Watkins stated that on the domestic-building-scale, Mr. O’Riordan’s presentation contains
images regarding the Port area, which is much more susceptible to flooding even before increases
in precipitation from climate change. The City is actively trying to engage the community around
the question of how to help people make improvements to their home and mitigate flood hazards.
CDD is starting to put together brochures that outline various climate-based improvements and
are starting a pilot program to start flood vulnerability audits in Area IV to help homeowners take
steps to make improvements to their homes by identifying vulnerabilities. In flood-prone areas,
for example, homeowners can move home infrastructure to higher locations, improve windows,
etc. The City is exploring how a grant/loan program might help this program.
Mr. Seidel asked whether newly constructed homes would undergo the same review.
Ms. Watkins replied that such a program is about existing homes and not new structures, which
will have their own building codes to ensure resilient construction.
Mr. Wineman qualified what he was about to say as perhaps a policy consideration, but noted the
various boundaries between city officials and residents. There may be homeowners for whom a
loan is accessible, but as landlords that don’t live in a house do not take advantage of
improvement programs. In such situations, he said, it is not hard to image a lot of folks not
benefiting from the resiliency audits if they can’t get their investment back in rental or sales
prices. There were probably also a lot of people who get audits but don’t follow through with
recommended repairs.
Ms. Watkins mentioned that new programs were in development to help low-income residents
stay in their homes and make capital improvements. Home Rehab, Inc. may be one partner in
helping people access money and workers to get flood safety projects done.
Mr. O’Riordan said that while progress seemed slow, when he started emergency systems were
engaged every time it rained. After a time, evaluations showed that the level of protection built
into the City’s drainage system was for 2-year-event-storms, which is incredible by today’s
standards. Cambridge is a relatively flat city, he continued, contained on much of its border by
dammed rivers that diminished the capacity of water to be shed away. After 1996, the City started
a program to address the flooding problems in the system. DPW put in 2.5 million gallons worth
of storage beneath streets, or the equivalent of a 10-year-event-storm. Doing so, DPW dug down
20-30ft to create huge reservoir tanks to store runoff. In 2010, however, the City experienced 4

Page 33 of 101

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Wineman asked what was the Committee and residents generally to do with the time frames
mentioned in these studies, because they have repeatedly proven to be optimistic. The Committee
is looking at a time frame much sooner than 2050.

2.2.c

DPW is about to embark on a major project at the intersection of Cherry, Maple, and School
Streets to create extra runoff capacity, but even these measures will not prevent flooding during
the new 25-year-storm of 2030, which he addressed to Mr. Wineman’s concern about optimistic
models of future conditions. It’s not enough, he said.
So what is the municipal responsibility? he asked, the City has standards to project infrastructure
but not really homes. Other than state wetlands law, the only flood regulations the City has
require onsite storage for new construction, with pumps to empty out the storage subsequent to
the storm event which means that new construction should actually improve storm water
management issues.
For single family homes that includes capacity for them to absorb through dry wells, run off
areas, rain gardens, and porous driveways.
Ms. Watkins cited the City’s commitment to making sure that new buildings are better than
existing structures.
Mr. O’Riordan returned to the prospect of 2070’s 100-year-storm-event, which will overwhelm
existing capacities, and in which some residents can anticipate salt water intrusion. We have to
figure out how to protect Fresh Pond. Be it flooding or heat islands, he went on, developing parks
to capture water and address other issues is a priority. They are all connected.
He shared that the City is about to build a green wall on the patio at the Senior Center as an
experiment.
Mr. Seidel stated that he saw green walls in SF, and thought they could have multiple benefits to
the city.
Mr. Wineman asked how green roofs fit into the City’s plans.
Mr. O’Riordan said that proposals to allow the inclusion of green roofs had been adopted 10
years ago, but there are not many that have been constructed. In Alewife, for example, the watertable is between 2-4 feet below ground level, but new projects continue to store water
underground because it is cheaper.
He added that the City is beginning to work with existing community organizations to better
integrate themselves and to use their endemic resources to get information out and be more
cognizant of vulnerable populations.
Mr. Kelley asked if DPW is the lead department on this.
Mr. O’Riordan responded that it’s not quite yet figured out. In terms of flooding, DPW is leading.
Organizing shelters to be staffed, resourced and appropriately located is multi-departmental, and
the City Manager’s office coordinates, as it does with community information systems.
Returning to his presentation, he highlighted that at the regional scale, a pressing issue is that a
fourth pump at the Amelia Earhart Dam needs to be installed to help flood reduction and

inches of rain in just 1 hour, and these maximum level of mitigation efforts were not enough. The
City can continue to augment our existing systems, but we are still vulnerable to extreme storms
which are no longer extraordinary.

mitigation by both increasing the capacity and providing redundancy. The cost might be about
$20 million and DCR is waiting for funding

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. O’Riordan said the Mystic River can convey only so much water, and the three existing
pumps can put that amount of water into harbor, but a new one is needed. This should be one of
the highest priorities in improving infrastructure.
Mr. Kelley asked why this isn’t a bigger priority and why the public doesn’t hear about a
necessary fourth pump. It seems more important than the railroad crossing at Alewife.
Mr. O’Riordan replied that it is the state’s responsibility.
Ms. Watkins stated that her department spends a lot of time talking about the regional scale, and
that the current Envision Cambridge process and regional planning is on concurrent tracks.
Mr. Kelley restated that we are not really talking about this anywhere. He said he recently
attended an Envision Cambridge discussion on Alewife and that flooding was never address. He
asked whether people are told about the flood vulnerability of these areas. The water does not
care who pays for the pumps, it just responds to if they are there and working or not.
Ms. Watkins said that the City is talking to developers about preparing for projected flooding and
for the 100-year-storm of 2030 and eventually the stronger 100-year-storm of 2070. They asked
that developers build to ensure their structure can withstand 2030 levels events, with the ability to
recover from the 2070 levels event by building sacrificial lower level amenities. Property owners
and residents can look to communal amenities in the aftermath of 2070’s 100-year-storm event.
Mr. O’Riordan said that while the City should discuss protecting people from the 100-year-storm
event, the 10- or 20-year-storm is going to directly impact residents in the Port, and must be
addressed.
Mr. Seidel suggested that ensuring the planners and participates of the Envision Cambridge had
adequate information could be a product of this Committee’s work, as could processing this
information with neighborhood groups.
Mr. Wineman added that widespread access to information may be a goal. He said there are
doubtless other examples of information of which residents are not well acquainted, but that is
well known in the City conversations.
A member asked Mr. O’Riordan to identify other vulnerable infrastructures.
He answered that power substations near Alewife are very vulnerable. Recognizing this, the City
has had several conversations with Eversource as to what strategies can be enacted to protect that
facility, and these are ongoing.
Mr. Seidel suggested that the Committee might either be helpful to act as a bridge for
disseminating climate related information to neighborhood groups or work with the City and
advise what information should be available.
Mr. O’Riordan turned the conversation toward heat’s increasing impact on Cambridge’s 19,000
trees, 13,000 of which are street trees, and 4,500 of which are found in parks and schools. He said
Cambridge is currently 30 percent covered by tree canopy, and an additional 35 percent has the

Page 35 of 101
Packet Pg. 86

2.2.c

Beyond that, he said, heavy snow events such as those experienced during the winter of 2014
cause some damage as some trees are more susceptible to snow or ice, just as large wind events
effect some species more than others. Sustained flooding could also kill certain trees. If a storm
surge were to push salty or brackish water into Alewife, then one would expect many trees to be
harmed.
Mr. Kelley asked if salt used on streets could cause stress as well.
Mr. O’Riordan thought is possible, yes, but couldn’t quantify.
He went on to say that all new trees are being watered on a contractual basis by the firm that
plants the trees, for the first two years but the general public needs to know to water trees in front
of their buildings as well.
Mr. Kelley turned the conversation to broader resiliency issues, and asked what DPW’s role
would be in a first-responder type event.
Mr. O’Riordan answered that DPW is not typically thought of as a first responder. The
department’s role is preparing, responding, and recovering from certain events. Simulations need
to be run to prepare, and the department does that. He said that there is an extraordinary effort
being made among the departments around coordination. The key points to preparedness are
looking at Facilities, Equipment, and Training: What areas do we sandbag, prepare for flooding,
do we get high-water trucks and train to use them, etc.
He stated that in terms of rainfall events, weather forecasting is becoming much more accurate
and the City can prepare accordingly. DPW also has intelligent systems to monitor how water is
entering the system, when to turn on pumps, etc. The many tanks embedded under the City’s
streets are passive systems, and don’t require energy to store water during an event, only
afterwards to empty them. There is backup power for these systems.
Mr. O’Riordan said that managing evacuation events and systems is also something the DPW is
considering but they already have procedures for snow, wind and storms that they coordinate with
Public Safety. From a climate change context, he added, the DPW’s main priority would be
debris management. How do you get rid of trash, damaged home materials, etc.? How do we
begin to use public notification systems and manage food and fuel supplies? Have we a role to
supply these to the people? These are all questions which he said DPW has for itself, and which
are still being discussed.
Wrapping up, Mr. Kelley asked the City Staff whether the current number of Committee
members present was sufficient enough to feel like their time was being effectively used.
Mr. O’Riordan relied that the group was ideal.

Page 36 of 101

potential to be covered. Cambridgeport has the greatest density, he noted, while Alewife contains
the lowest density. MIT is another area of low density. When we think about climate change and
trees, he added, there are a number of trees at risk for diseases associated with temperature
increases. The Emerald Ash borer also poses a threat to the City’s 1,000 ash trees, which have all
been treated at the expense of about $100,000 a year.

2.2.c

Mr. Seidel noted that the talk opened with science but it’s important that the Committee needs to
move toward a community discussion. How to make information usable to people and maybe
even confront them with options and issues.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley concluded the DPW portion of the meeting and thanked both Mr. O’Riordan and Ms.
Watkin’s for their time and input.
The Committee took a 5 minute break.
Mr. Kelley moved to accept the June minutes upon returning.
The minutes were accepted with unanimous approval.
Mr. Kelley stated that for future meetings, seven members is probably as low as the Committee
should go for any meeting, and asked whether that made sense to those present. He asked how
many would not be able to attend the August meeting.
He continued that regarding upcoming presentations, the Committee had previously agreed on
presentations from Public Safety and Public Health. He said the Committee had about seven
meetings left during which they could invite presenters, or the members could spend more time
evaluating what we’ve learned thus far it they wished. The Committee has also expressed interest
in learning about food systems.
Mr. Seidel asked whether the Committee should invite the Utile team behind the Envision
Cambridge process to present, or whether members could visit their office.
Mr. Kelley said it might be a good idea, and reiterated his recent conversation at the Resiliency
table for Envision Alewife in which no one said anything about the Earhart Dam needing an extra
pump.
Mr. Seidel said that as an interim project, the Committee can make sure Envision is aware of our
work and priorities.
Mr. Kelley redirected the group to consider who they’d like to hear present. A service provider
was previous identified as a potential speaker.
Mr. Seidel asked about the subsequent months, and what Mr. Kelley meant when he said the
Committee had seven spots to fill. He questioned whether two meetings is enough to realistically
draft our final project?
Mr. Kelley said that the Committee could do less.
Mr. Seidel offered that a field trip somewhere was still of interest.
Mr. Wineman asked whether a discussion of food systems was still possible, as previously
discussed.
Mr. Kelley directed Mr. Durbin to work with Ms. Holloway on confirming an expert in food
systems.

Page 37 of 101

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley turned the conversation to the graphic illustrator that captured the June meeting. He
noted the handout in everyone’s packet that contained a copy of her drawing, and said the thought
was that she could come to fall public meetings. He asked for the Committee’s reactions.

Mr. Kelley responded that having more people identify with the message was always a challenge.
As Ms. Kennedy demonstrated during the last meeting, the idea is to turn the discussion it into a
document that is more capable of communicating with residents than standardized notes.
Mr. Wineman said that while the illustrations were interesting and helpful during the meeting, a
month later they didn’t mean anything to him.
Mr. Kelley said the Committee did not need to pursue the illustrations further. He turned instead
to ask how the view of the committee had evolved since first meeting. Did members have new
thoughts regarding the challenges and opportunities that Cambridge faced?
Mr. Spears said he better understood what issues effect which neighborhoods, and that different
neighborhoods have different issues. He hoped that would continue, as most discussions have
been on a city-wide scope, but they haven’t looked at neighborhoods and their specific challenges
quite as much.
Ms. Dillard said that a lot of the Committee’s discussions have looked at environmental
resiliency, but there hasn’t been much thought about social issues and stresses. Perhaps there is a
connectivity issue regarding these two concerns, she said.
Mr. Seidel agreed that the neighborhood aspect is still missing. The Committee is doing well at
getting an official view of resiliency, but haven’t backed that down to what happens if a tree falls
on his street, or flooding on his corner. What happens at the neighborhood level?
Mr. King recalled the earlier discussion about making improvements to all buildings in
Cambridge, and asked how people monetize such improvements. He noted that the DPW’s
brochure on making improvements to the house were helpful, but asked how do we get people to
follow these guidelines. Making such improvements costs a lot of money, but whether it will
create value to the house is not understood. How do we monetize the preparedness of domestic
infrastructures? How do we incentivize people to make necessary preparations?
Mr. Spears wondered what happens if the City is not mitigating things?
Mr. King asked how one sells the sort of public investment to the public to address long range
risks?
Mr. Kelley agreed that we have difficulty visualizing major events, so it’s important to remember
examples and get people to put value on preparedness.
Mr. Dmytryk recapped an email he sent to Councillor Kelley’s office today regarding police trust
issues. He qualified that while he don’t know a lot about the issue, the unease between minority
communities and police is an issue, he thought, and if police presences is required to address most
first-responder events then the trust issue may become a problem.

Page 38 of 101

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Dillard asked what the point of these graphic illustrations was.

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley asked the Committee whether they saw any opportunities for further discussion or
projects for the group.
Mr. Seidel said he was struck by the indoor air quality problem, and stated it would be interesting
to see if the Fire Department rates all buildings for such. He wondered what results you might
generate if you took all building types and overlay a map with heat islands to make projections
about the specific stresses those areas will face. By looking at what the stresses might be and
recognizing that community cohesion can vary, one could come up with a plan and mechanisms
to address them.
Ms. Dillard said that indoor air quality (IAQ) has a lot to do with traffic, whether HVAC systems
are up-to-date, and if air exchange is good.
Mr. King noted that new buildings are tight to be efficient but that can lead to IAQ and mold
issues.
Mr. Kelley said the Committee could ask Public Health people to specifically address that issue
when they present.
Mr. Wineman returned to the topic of challenges and opportunities, and asked to share two
anecdotes. At the last meeting, he said one of the specific topics that came up were solar charges
for cell phones, so he went to Radio Shack to ask about them. He mentioned that he was involved
in a resiliency committee, and guy at desk just opened up regarding flooding, climate change, and
continued talking for 10-15 minutes, even though Radio Shack did not sell the chargers. Mr.
Wineman stated that the clerk thanked him for his attention to this problem. Speaking to the
challenge side of enacting policies, then, he said he looked online and found that the Microcenter
seemed to have them. Earlier that day, however, when he went to ask, the salesmen said they
didn’t have them. Upon review, in fact, the computer reported they did have one in stock, and so
he was sent around to further salesclerks. He concluded by saying that he could have gone home
and ordered online, but brought up the experience to demonstrate the disconnect that can occur
when the city makes a recommendation with no sense on the ground about how something will
work or be accessible. We make a simple recommendation—get a solar charger—but there is no
follow through in making that easy to use, purchase or otherwise access.
Mr. Wineman continued that when the Committee arrives at the point of making its
recommendation in May and June of next year, they need to be very acute to the granular needs
of the community and our recommendations. Perhaps the city can stockpile certain service
products, such as solar chargers, but there are many other examples, he said.
Mr. Kelley asked the Committee what other gaps they could fill, whether communications issues,
infrastructure investment issues, etc.
Mr. Dmytryk said that all the black roofs in Cambridge are also a problem, and perhaps the group
could think about ways to incentivize the installation of white (or non-black) roofs.
Mr. Kelley said perhaps there is something his Council office can do.

Page 39 of 101

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Spears said that problems are not ubiquitous. In the Midwest, police officers mostly come
from suburbs and are thrust into urban areas where they are ill-prepared to engage with people
and navigate the social environment. That is not always the case in Cambridge, where police
come from our community.

2.2.c

He continued that Mr. King’s point on how to make sure resiliency improvements included in
home values is relevant. In the discussion to get drainage from the roof into the sewer system, for
example, an attempt was made to allow further FAR and height adjustments.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel said that large scale batteries should also be addressed as a gap to explore where
generators may not be appropriate.
Mr. Kelley asked what field trips the Committee might find helpful. He said he really wanted to
go on a dam field trip, and perhaps the Committee could visit both dams that protect the
Cambridge community. He said that his office will facilitate a discussion on the issue, and it
would likely be a Saturday event.
He also included the MEMA bunker out in Framingham to get idea of where we fit into regional
equation, and asked for others.
Members thought that the two current options were a good start.
Mr. Kelley asked whether the Committee would like to appoint a Vice Chair in the event of his
absence.
Mr. Seidel nominated Mr. King to be Vice Chair.
Mr. Seidel also stated he wanted to start whatever final document the Committee would create
now, so that we are not struggling to produce something at the end.
Mr. Kelley responded that his thought was to condense minutes and highlight topics thus far
discussed, which we would open up to comment via Slack.
Mr. Seidel said he’d like to see a Goggle doc that the Committee can begin writing and drafting.
Mr. Durbin stated the Committee could think about small projects that would be included in the
final presentation. By initiating short-term goals the committee could began drafting the final
project, and members could figure out how the group works. Obtainable goals are important.
Mr. Kelley moved to adjourn the meeting.
Mr. Durbin reminded the chair that a motion is on the table to elect Mr. King as Vice Chair, and
asked if there was a second.
Mr. Kelley seconded the motion.
Mr. King was selected as Vice Chair by a unanimous vote.
Mr. Kelley adjourned the meeting and thanked everyone for their time. He reminded the group
that the next regular meeting would be held on August 30.

Officer; Robyn Estwick, Emergency Communications Department;
Christina Giacobbe, Director of Emergency Communications
Department

Mr. Kelley called meeting to order, and thanked the members of the Cambridge Police
Department, Cambridge Fire Department, and Emergency Management Department for their time
and attention to the committee’s work.
Mr. Reardon said work on resiliency during emergency situations larges focus on the steps after
an event, this deals largely with:
who mans the shelters;
how many people can the City shelter;
what is the back up if power goes out;
does the City have access to small boats or transportation vehicles for local flooding
events?
A main focus of the City’s preparation measures center around emergency generators, and they
recently received a grant to put in a transfer switch at CRLS High School to plug in a mobile
generator that can provide power to that location in the event it needs to be used as a shelter. He
said CFD is always looking down the road at those type of events, and watching the aftermath of
disasters that hit elsewhere. Looking at the response after New Orleans, he explained, officials
were surprised to found out that many people did not go to shelters because their pets couldn’t be
with them, and thus shelter practices have changed. Supplies for shelters now include provisions
for pets.
Mr. Reardon continued that one of the most important considerations in the wake of an
emergency or natural event was communication. Communication with other emergency response
personnel, and also with citizens. Often responders have to stay in communication to answer the
question: How do we move people? He stated that the communication system used by emergency
management was resilient, not least because they do not depend upon the continued operations of
private network companies. The Fire Department and Police Department need, and have, their
own public radio systems for internal communications. These system do work during

August 30, 2016—795 Mass Ave, City Hall, Ackerman Room: 6:30 P.M.

2.2.c

He added that they also consider how to prepare for “All Hazard Events,” and how does the City
respond? They actively search out and research the type of events that are likely to hit
Cambridge, whether earthquakes or hurricanes. These are type of broad based events that are
likely to impact regional communities. CFD does have search & rescue teams.
Mr. Kelley said that we often talk about the professional response, but asked about the local
community response.
Mr. Reardon responded that in terms of buildings, a lot of new high rises around the city will give
directions to the firefighters about the special needs that an occupant might have, or other relevant
information in addition to specifics about the building. For getting information out during flood
situations, he said they rely on message boards, social media, and reverse-911. In an active
emergency, First Responders will go door-to-door if needed. Emergency events are often highly
situationally dependent. A hot and humid day is a different hazmat scenario than a cold rainy day,
and the response changes accordingly. Obviously people caught in an active event would be
directed about how to act.
Mr. Mahoney stated that Emergency Management tries to be proactive in educating the public on
how to interact with the public safety, and through their connections in the corporate world and
life science industries they try to get people to understand their own roles in planning for an
emergency. They have learned through events like Katrina that the government, whether local,
state, or federal can’t be everything to everyone in an emergency situation. Citizens need to take
the time to prepare. He advised that people think about a situation in which they are left with no
power for 5 days, and ask themselves: How do I get medicine? What will I eat and drink? How
will I communicate with family members? Unfortunately, it is hard to gauge the success of these
preparedness steps and awareness programs. He said that the Emergency Management team
reaches out to the Cambridge Chronicle and various other social media groups such as Facebook,
Twitter, and NextDoor.
Dovetailing with that, Mr. Mahoney continued, are resiliency documents from around the country
that try to instill in people a common sense approach to preparedness and reaching out to
authorities for help. People should know to contact the proper authorities not just in the case of a
suspicious backpack in a train station, but also when someone is clearly in need, or if there is
something that DPW can correct. “See Something, Say Something” is broader than just bomb
scares. He said they try to educate the public on their responsibility to communication with
various public safety departments.
Mr. Rogers asked if there was any change in drilling with high population/high buildings and the
growth of the Kendall Square area.
Mr. Mahoney said his department relied on the tremendous relationship they have built with
Harvard and MIT to collaborate with facilities and personnel, during and after an emergency as
well as to work with and learn from subject matter experts. To respond to an event, it helps to
foster a collaborative relationship with city agencies and the various life science buildings, citizen
groups, and corporations that share Cambridge.
Ms. Harrison asked if there are groups that are more responsive to the city’s outreach efforts.

Page 42 of 101
Packet Pg. 93

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

emergencies, he said. During 9/11 and the Marathon Bombing, for example, the communications
did not go down.

Mr. Reardon answered that without a doubt private corporations have a better time
communicating with their populations, not least because they have a captive audience and are
also concerned with financial losses. He said that when new developments are being build, it has
to be in corporation with Fire Department and emergency services in mind. They look at
stairwells, exit strategies, and shelter in place procedures, noting that even in the event of a fire on
one level of a building, sometimes it is much safer to stay in place rather than evacuate. The new
computer and communication systems used by tall buildings tell you where an emergency is
located, and how to take appropriate action, to include sheltering in place on one floor while
another floor is being evacuated.
Mr. Gover stated that there was a Kendall Square Emergency Network which regularly meets to
talk about efforts to reduce crime, bicycle thefts, and transit issues. The network notifies the city
of problems, and we use them to spread fire tips, evacuation plans, make sure none of the
evacuations overlap. He said that they work very closely with companies, some of which have to
file Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act paperwork about hazardous
materials onsite. He said they also work very closely with the Cambridge Housing Alliance. In
most situations, you can shelter in place even when there is a fire in your building. The Fire
Department works closely with Cambridge Office of Disabilities, as well, to receive information
on where persons with special needs or mobility issues might be located in a building. The
Department also does a lot of work with the SAFE program, a fire awareness program for
students. In school, they train children to ask their parents about the family’s emergency plans,
what to do in an emergency, and how to prevent fires. He said the CFD is also running these
programs in public housing facilities as well.
Ms. Andujar asked whether the Watermark Building on Kendall Square is also equipped with the
technology mentioned earlier by Mr. Reardon. She wanted to know whether they were prepared
to address the needs of the elderly and handicapped during a fire.
Mr. Reardon responded that building managers are supposed to instruct residents on what to do in
the event of a fire. He said the CFD is working on software to track people with special needs
even if they don’t like in public housing. Such a system would let the CFD know if a building has
a person with special needs or a disability, even a temporary disability such as a recent surgery,
and relay that information to first responders. New buildings pretty much have those programs
installed, he said.
Mr. Kelley asked whether those buildings still have fire drills.
Mr. Reardon responded that fire drills are required by law in schools.
Mr. Kelley said that people do what people do. He said he is trying to figure out how to
conceptualize the expectations for what the city is going to do, and what people should do.
Mr. Mahoney said that studies have shown that if 100 people walk into an area, 95 of them will
try to go out the way that they came in. He asked how many people look at different egresses than
those they entered the last time they went to a hotel.
Mr. Reardon explained that that’s the personal responsibility situation. You may go up to your
room in an elevator, and know you can’t use it in an emergency, but how many people actually
look for the stairway or know how many stairs there are to the exit? People are usually not
prepared, they are lulled into false sense of security. It’s a very tough lesson to learn and in an

2.2.c

2.2.c

Mr. Wilson said that this sort of situational awareness is not only relevant during a fire or active
shooter situation. If there was a vehicular accident in front of your apartment or place of work,
how are you going to get out? People need to be situationally aware, but not paranoid. Getting
back to expectations, it all relies on just being aware. How often do you see people walking with
earbuds, he asked, and not paying attention when they walk into a raised sidewalk and suddenly a
car is upon them?
Mr. Seidel asked what the first thing that CFD tells citizens in regards to fire preparedness.
Mr. Reardon said the department talks to younger people about basic info, Stop Drop and Roll,
matches, finding an egress, etc. He noted one of the best ways to be prepared is to act out
situations, and so the department is always trying to get a smaller center for training real life
scenarios. It’s best if people can see what it may look like when a fence is electrified by a downed
powerline, or experience how difficult it can be to try to get out a window ladder.
Mr. Seidel asked if CFD knows if a building has an elevator when they receive a call.
Mr. Mahoney explained that the entire city is broken down in to inspection districts which are
regularly inspected and walked. New constructions are inspected throughout the process,
allowing the district managers to become acquainted with the respective facilities. You get
comfortable with them for a number of reasons, he said, though he noted that fires on
constructions sites are special problems. The inspectors do a good job getting out in their district
and knowing it. The fire companies are required to go out in the day and evening and walk in the
areas in their district. This outreach has had unintended benefits, as they sometimes see active
medical emergencies, fires, and people come out to ask questions. He commented that a personal
pet peeve is how often people think they can control a fire with their own extinguisher. Let the
fire department extinguish fires, he said.
Mr. Reardon said in terms of response there is a difference between a commercial building and
private inhabitance, they pose vastly different problems. New, bigger buildings have a lot of
relevant fire and emergency response information on line but still, in commercial buildings, do
people know where they should go while in smaller, residential buildings, the layouts can be
unique and unpredictable which can make building clearing challenging.
Mr. Gover said a lot of commercial areas do practice evacuation exercises. Many places have
floor wardens and public safety staff walk people through ‘what ifs’ for things like active shooter
issues. An example was knowing where a fence would block off your exit if there was an active
shooter.
Mr. Reardon said that workers are trained to let people know how to get out, they are trained to
get out themselves.
Mr. Hope asked that the members of the CFD talk more about how they go into schools and talk
to kids about fires?
Mr. Mahoney said that student awareness programs focus mainly around the fire awareness and
anti-smoking component, funded by money associated with cigarette sales. He said they get into
the public schools in the first couple of weeks after the year starts to discuss safety in schools.

emergency one does not have a lot of time. He added that it’s not like people have to be in a
constant doomsday-mode mentality, but it doesn’t take very long for situations to get out of hand.

2.2.c

One of the methods that’s been proven effective is to ask that the children take fliers home and
actively pester the parents about emergency plans and fire safety. If that’s happened, he
explained, we’ve captured the kid and the parent. He also noted that the school has to have the
plan in place before the start of the school year. Students are also taught to go out the closest exit.

Mr. Gover said the fire safety program is proven effective. Kids really don’t play with matches as
much as they used to, he said.
Mr. Kelley moved the conversation to the city’s preparations for after a large scale emergency
event has occurred.
Mr. Seidel asked how many emergency beds the city had in storage.
Mr. Gover said the city has two trailers that can be mobilized immediately, one for people with
pets and one the general public. Each has 150 cots, hygienic products, facility building supplies,
and even several bariatric cots for larger individuals.
Mr. Reardon said that with help from the Urban Area Security Initiative, they have access to an
additional 1000 cots, extra generators, etc. In large scale events, they can’t be shared, but
hopefully such an event is not widespread.
Mr. Mahoney said that increasingly, people are unwilling to go to shelters. They are skeptical.
During Hurricane Irene, only eight people came to the shelters in Cambridge, and six of them
were from homeless populations. Between social media and resiliency mindset, people are
hesitant to go to a shelter.
Mr. Wineman asked in a disaster scenario such Hurricane Sandy or Katrina, what was the
emergency management’s take on how that would play out in Cambridge, and asked how
prepared we are to deal with the event, whether high water or something else.
Mr. Reardon said that during Hurricane Sandy there was a lot of sites that were not resilient, they
lost battery backup, communications, cell phone service, internet, etc. Cambridge emergency
management services use their own communications, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks are so
important in these situations. We bring our own antenna, he said. During the worst of Sandy, he
said, there was a lot of flooding and concerns about how you get people out. Cambridge has
additional people trained specifically in swift water rescue. Cambridge might never have the type
of flash flooding and fast currently that Colorado experiences, but going door to door to rescue
people during high water events employs same equipment and technics. UASI has 10 small boats
to push through high water and CFD has two boats of its own. He said the department also
considers how to use military grade vehicles to transport people. Even if those events are not
likely to happen here, we should be prepared. They train for water issues in the Harbor.
Historically, we look at holes that are only exposed after a failure, and try to fill them in. He
noted that most fire codes result after deaths.
Mr. Kelley explained that one of the things the Committee had talk about before is flood water
topping the dams, and he sense that we are overly optimistic about our preparedness. He asked if
that is that what these boats are for.
Mr. Reardon said primarily, yes. US Coast Guard grant has specific targets, but the department
can turn around and use this money for other events. Cambridge is not going to have Rockies

2.2.c

swift water, but training for those situations will help in our neighborhoods. That is the theory for
preparing the smaller boats.

Mr. Reardon said there are so many buildings and senior centers that people can go to cool off,
which includes malls. We look heat in terms of driving other issues: fires are more difficult to
control; putting on a fireproof suit during the hottest days of the year causes extra stress to
firefighters, and so CFD push hydration on hot days and rotates personnel more frequently; you
tend to see more motor failures and other system failures as elevators and other systems overheat.
CFD tends to see an increase in smaller fires during hot days, which tend to be electrical in nature
due to browning the voltage. These tend to be nuisance events, but not long term strain events,
yet.
Mr. Kelley asked Mr. Reardon to explain what he meant by “browning the voltage.”
Mr. Reardon said that while power companies won’t admit to it, they often decrease the juice on a
line during hot days. But we know it happens. If you take a 120 volt circuit, for example, and for
some reason it is running at 115 volts, that unit will cause the motor to overheat more quickly
because it is pulling more current. Sometimes it happens naturally, such as when you’re at the end
of the grid and the electricity is not going all the way through.
Mr. Seidel asked how the police relate to these types of events. During a fire or a shooting, how
do the two departments interact?
Mr. Burke responded that the Cambridge Police Department has already received most calls from
the field by the time the Fire Department is mobilized. A lot of our role is looking at how to take
short-term steps, such as getting people out of a building or out of the way, establishing
communication channels, and gaining access to the building. In the event of a fire, once the CFD
is on scene, they take full control. CPD will typically set up perimeters, constrict vehicle access,
establish ambulance egress, and set up area for keeping public safe. In shooting incident, police
officers will be the first on the scene, and will immediately start to provide medical care, and then
rely heavily on medical teams when they arrive. Officers would stabilize and secure injured
parties and arrange for transport. One thing that is pretty unique to Cambridge is the solid
relationship between CPD and CFD. The leadership of Fire Department is key to that
relationship, he said, explaining that they train together, rely on each other in emergency
situations, and know in some incidents to take a step back and allow the experts in their field to
do their work. Emergencies responders are good at recognizing the limits of their expertise.
Mr. Wilson said that police officers and firefighters often train together now, whether for fires,
accidents, or active shooters. Each department will establish a scene manager for an active event,
and the on-scene manager from CFD and CPD immediately look for each other. Cambridge is
one of the first police departments in the nation to have fire paramedics trained to go in with
police in an active shooter situation, for example.
Mr. Reardon said that the two departments need each other in every situation. With a suspicious
package, the Explosive Ordinance Unit (EOU) and Hazmat are dispatched together for each
event, and they each have their own responsibilities. The departments share one giant radio
system, and work off the same information. Everyone is hearing the same thing back and forth.
The responders are very fortunate, he said, because Cambridge is well known in the hallows of

Page 46 of 101

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Aidinoff asked how the departments think about longer term emergencies, such as heat.

2.2.c

D.C. for what the City does and how we do it. All the key supervisors from both departments are
on friendly terms and know each other.

Mr. Gover added that the Fire Department collaborates extensively with the emergency
communication department. Planned events are an opportunity to work through communications
issues.
Mr. Reardon said that during the 4th of July, for example, Emergency Management takes a MIT
classroom and in three days turns it into a command center for communication. He said it was
incredible to watch what happens to set up headquarters. A coordination center is necessary for
big events, he explained, particularly in the aftermath of an emergency as it gives local and
federal authorities a central area to take command. It can make for easy transitions.
Ms. Harrison explained that she is a tutor in one of Harvard’s dorms, and said that they are
trained on fire preparation, but not for an active shooter situation. Even if the probability of such
an event is low, she asked why they were not given equivalent training.
Mr. Reardon said that his staff does some training, but agreed with Ms. Harrison, there was not
much. He said that emergency responders would use fire alarm for an evacuation strategy, so the
drills are similar. But the events always start off as chaotic.
Mr. Burke explained that CPD frequently train with the Harvard and MIT police departments.
They required certification yearly, and so CPD also interacts with them frequently at City run
events. He said that his staff knows their counterparts in the university police departments, and go
through joint active shooter situations. He said they employ the lessons learned from Columbine.
Students and staff formerly were told to find a secure area and wait for SWAT, but casualties are
taken during that time, and it’s a flawed response. His officers are now trained in immediate
response, and they don’t have to wait for SWAT team now. They have weapons and vests in their
vehicles. If there were an active shooter situation at Harvard and MIT, he said that the two
departments have already trained together and know the buildings and layout. With the recent
opening of Cambridge public schools, there have also been lots of training with administrators at
those locations. The students may not see it, but from a communication, officer, and
administration standpoint, we are prepared, he said.
Ms. Harrison said that she lives with the students, and tutors get trained in how to manage a
crowd, communicate commands, evacuations, etc. For all the talking about shooting in academic
settings, though, she thought it strange that there was not much training. If resiliency is
preparedness, then perhaps that could be incorporated.
Mr. Reardon repeated that the same protocol was used for fire evacuation and shooter evacuation,
so specific training is not given but evacuation can help secondary crew handle shooting victims
quickly.
Mr. Hope said that from a parent’s point of view, he was glad there is not a lot of police presence
at the school. He did not think that schools should adopt a fortress attitude, which might scare the
children.

Page 47 of 101
Packet Pg. 98

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Burke said the emergency communication piece is just as important, they keep information
exchanging.

2.2.c

Mr. Reardon said that while a student may not know the exact protocol, the teachers are trained to
give instructions and take headcounts. We try to do it in a low profile situation.

Mr. Burke said that it is important for parents to talk proactively about possible events so their
children know how to respond, and in many cases, children understand more than we give them
credit. They need to be able to think and ask “what if?” CPD met with CPS staff yesterday,
training the school administrators. It’s not supposed to trickle down to students, it’s about the
staff and teachers knowing to run/hide/fight as officers arrive within minutes.
Ms. Giacobbe said that with National Preparedness Month, the Emergency Management team is
staging extra events to make sure the community is prepared and first responders are out in the
community, engaging community. She said there is also a lot outreach through hashtags, Twitter,
Facebook, etc.
Mr. Mahoney said there is always a certain percentage of people that will not listen to advice or
preparedness info.
Mr. Dmytryk asked if there was any cause for concern or any event that might trigger a problem
with MIT’s nuclear reactor.
Mr. Mahoney said that CFD does extensive training with their staff. Speaking with all sincerity,
he said, he had no concerns about that facility. The reactor is low power, and can’t sustain itself
without an outside power source. Since 1958, the MIT reactor has undergone numerous surprise
inspections, and they have passed them all. Many of these institutes in chemistry of life sciences
self-police so well that it’s usually not a problem. Often their grants depend on it, and the
companies do not want fire trucks sitting outside of their building. Of course, accidents do
happen, he said. There was a recent fire at a local biotech facility, and to the untrained eye it
looked like an explosion, which is what the media reported. In fact, work was going on the roof
that was unrelated to any facility work. Someone laid a torch on the rubber roof and it caught fire,
but the public reaction was colored by the work inside.
Mr. Reardon repeated that the reactor requires power to sustain itself. Without power, he said, it
will shut itself down, and the Fire Department can also shut it down externally. He said
knowledge of the MIT reactor was not something that keeps him up at night. He said he was far
more concerned about safety of the subways or malls than the reactor.
Ms. Kubik complimented the presenters on their good job defining the partnership with first
responders, but asked if there was any way to incorporate second responders. She gave the
example of architects being brought into buildings to judge soundness or rebuilding efforts.
Mr. Reardon said that such individuals might be useful after an event, but they need to get on
scene quickly. On a large scale event, they often do we need to get other experts in to evaluate the
situation. Mobilizing contracts, machinery access, fuel deliveries and more is comlex. He
mentioned that it could be something for CitizenCorps.
Mr. Mahoney said that Ms. Kubik offered an interesting idea, and perhaps there should be
opportunities for people like architects to come in to go through training as well.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Wilson added that each school has its own officer, so the children know the officer and are
not paranoid by their presence. They also have someone they can relate to.

2.2.c

Mr. Reardon said that often the boundaries are fluid. During a chemical spill, for example, there
is a proscribed evacuation limit. He said there isn’t a defined way to act, and it’s not an exact
science and a fair amount is guesswork or worst case scenario planning.
Mr. Spears asked if CPD was taking any special preparations around the 15th anniversary of 9/11.
Mr. Wilson said that everyone is aware of the anniversary coming up. CPD is told to be
especially awareness during any anniversary, but that he didn’t want to push people too far.
Everyone understands, he said the police department will keep an eye on all infrastructures, but in
a way the average citizen may not notice.
Mr. Reardon said whether it’s April 15, 4th of July now, there are lots of anniversaries that are
cause for special attention, and well as anything that draws crowds:
Mr. Wilson said copycats are always of concern, not just on the yearly anniversary of an event,
but within the 72 hours after an event.
Mr. Burke said the CPD was hooked into information coming from the Boston Regional
Intelligence Center (BRIC), and monitored Cambridge specific information.
Mr. Reardon said that they often look globally as well. If there is something in Mumbai, Spain, or
London, you turn around and start to look locally. The general public will often ramp up anxieties
after an event, as they are more sensitive. If something happens in Europe, CPD will get an uptick
of calls about suspicious activities or packages.
Mr. Wilson said that after an incident the call rate is really high, and it ratchets down eventually
but never disappears completely anymore. We get calls almost every day about packages or
backpacks, which we don’t mind. It’s a good thing, he added, and CPD has equipment for those
situations.
Mr. Reardon said that Cambridge has many of the emergency assets they might need here, so
unlike other municipalities, they don’t need to wait for it to arrive from the state or other
facilities. It itself, our ability to respond makes us a less attractive target.
Mr. Burke said that the best investment the City had made recently is the bomb dogs and the
explosive ordinance teams. A 300’ evacuation zone around an unknown package can really muck
things up if not addressed quickly.
Mr. Seidel said that problem the Committee and residents have often seen is a lag time in
communication during an event, and then in information immediately following.
Mr. Wilson responded that CPD tries to get the information out quickly, but some of the delay is
intentional. The key to understanding any emergency event is that 95 percent of what you hear
immediately after an incident occurs is going to be wrong. So that’s where the rub is, he said. Info
will be coming out, but deliberately. He said CPD wants to get info out, but also make sure that
any information they do release is accurate.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Durbin explained that he was interested in how the boundaries of an event are defined,
whether for an active situation or in the aftermath, and asked if there was a process Emergency
Management went through to determine the extent of an impact event.

Page 49 of 101
Packet Pg. 100

2.2.c

Mr. Wilson said he knows the Council is often getting requests for information, but they don’t
want to give false information. Even the person who makes an emergency call might not be
accurate about the situation.
Mr. Mahoney said during the construction accident that day, they were barely into the situation
when they started receiving calls from the media. They want to be right, not first.
Ms. Giacobbe said for a flood or other local event, they would tap into MEMA to send out alerts,
it all depends on the type of events. She said residents should also sign up for CODE RED and
other alerts to be made aware of things like water main breaks..
Mr. Reardon said they also try to send out info only to those areas that are affected, so as not to
raise alarm in unaffected areas needlessly.
Mr. Kelley thanked all the members from the Emergency Response team and broke the meeting
for a 5 min break.
After 5 mins, Mr. Kelley brought the Committee back into session, and moved to accept July the
minutes.
The minutes were accepted with a unanimous vote of the Committee.
Mr. Kelley gave an update on the photo, which had only one participant at the moment, which
was himself. He said the lack in response was an interesting illustration about how outreach
efforts work. He encouraged members to submit their own pictures.
He turned the conversation to whether the Committee would like to bring Sherri Kennedy back in
to record some more graphic notes.
Several of the members said they did not find the recording very useful, and Mr. Kelley said he
would communicate the Committee’s position to Ms. Kennedy. He asked Mr. Durbin to give an
update on a trip to the Earhart and Charles Rivers Dams.
Mr. Durbin reported that he had been working through the Office of State Senator Will
Brownsberger to set up a meeting with the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)
controlled dams, but had recently received a notice that a tour might not be possible. He explain
that he was communicated directly now with DCR staff to arrange a discussion by a facility
expert on nearby public land, and would keep the Committee updated.
Mr. Kelley said that if it’s an abbreviated presentation from a DCR expert, then perhaps the
Committee can go to Alewife and other flooding areas.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Reardon added that if his department were to put out the wrong information, it causes all
kinds of anxiety that is unnecessary. The news media is trying to find someone, anyone that will
talk, and so it creates a rush to judgement, but many times it’s not right.

Mr. Kelley also invited members to begin thinking about what to present to the mayor, and collect
their thoughts on SLACK. He said members should go there to group thoughts, and said it is easy
to use, and invited them to poke around.

Page 50 of 101
Packet Pg. 101

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman asked Mr. Kelley to explain his thought process on having presentations and
themed meetings for the next four months. He said it would be useful to have at least one of next
four to have an internal conversation, process information, and go over next steps. While setting
aside 45 minutes for a presentation and Q&A might seem like a good idea, it very reality meets
reality. He said the Committee is often presented with lot of information and anecdotes, but they
are not given time to discuss.
Mr. Kelley agreed and asked what some common themes the members had already seen.
Ms. Harrison asked how the City enables or entitles people to ask for help. Some people will ask
for help, but others will not. She explained that a lot of what makes people ask for help begins
with their perceived place in a society, and the role they think they play in it. If you entitle people
to feel deserving of certain services, then they will more readily call for them. How to you
enable/entitle people to ask for help.
Mr. Rogers said that the Departments cannot be blamed for not address the concerns that the
Committee would like. They are only responding to agenda they are given, he said, instead of
responding to our collective agenda and issues. They take up a lot of time, and we get good ideas,
he said, but then there is not time.
Mr. Kelley said that in giving the Departments questions and a broad agenda he didn’t want to
script the conversation too much. He wanted to hear what they say would organically.
Mr. Seidel added that he didn’t think the Committee members should blame ourselves too
harshly. They just got an hour with Fire and Police Chief, he pointed out, of a 100,000+
population city, with two of the best universities in the world. The question is how we carve out
the next hour, he said.
Mr. Rogers said that the Committee really needs at least another hour to talk.
Ms. Andujar asked Ms. Harrison to repeat her earlier comment.
Ms. Harrison said that when people think they are apart of an institution, they feel entitled to
certain services and will reach out and ask for them. Others may not do this because they have
trust issues, or bad experiences. Specifically, there are situations when the poor or homeless will
not reach out for help if they are sick because they fear they will get in trouble. “Subjectivity: Who one thinks they are in a community will shape how they ask for services in a community.
Ms. Andujar thanked Ms. Harrison for her thoughts, and agreed that her observation was a very
basic and important thing to talk about. The chief concern thus far was people not following
directions, but perhaps what Ms. Harrison said is also going on.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

He continued that the Committee needed to start distilling the process thus far, what have we
identified as gaps. He asked what they wanted to give the general public to empower them to
view themselves are partners with the emergency response groups in the city.

Mr. Aidinoff asked if the Committee could begin to set a goal or two for itself, so it’s not just two
hours of talking, and to write up a page of themes to benchmark progress.
Mr. Wineman agreed that said that if we looked at the monthly meetings as a working meetings to
draft portions of our final version, then their time could be better spent and they could begin

Page 51 of 101
Packet Pg. 102

2.2.c

chipping away at the final set of recommendations. He said he did not think they should wait until
the last moment.

Mr. Durbin said that he was able to schedule a meeting with Jose Alvarez for October to discuss
food security issue, but that such a meeting would have to happen during business hours because
Mr. Alvarez is not available in the late evening. He would give more information about setting up
a small committee to meet with Mr. Alvarez at their September meeting.
Mr. Kelley said he would like to have Public Health and the school department come in, and
asked if that worked for the Committee. We agreed on Public Health for the October meeting and
to have the September meeting be an organization review of the Committee, its goals, its final
report and so forth.
Mr. Seidel returned to the concern of appropriately dividing time. Getting all this information is
pretty impressive, he said, but the question is not what they are doing, it’s what we think about
what their doing and what that means to us. How do we stand in relation to that, he asked. The
tactical is interesting, he concluded, but not relevant.
Mr. Aidinoff said it is perhaps relevant in terms as how they connect their terms and relate them
to the public.
Mr. Wineman said that the most interesting question was how the departments coordinate with
each other. And how to create those relationships in other departments seems key. We need to
figure out how to create that elsewhere, he said.
Mr. Kelley thanked everyone for their participation, and adjourned the meeting.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said he still hoped to bring in a few more presenters, and asked Mr. Durbin to explain
the remaining presentation.

Tony Spears; Steve Wineman

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Mr. Kelley opened the meeting and thanked everyone for coming.
Mr. Dmytryk announced that there was an event coming up that people might be interested to
attend. The Green Cambridge series has its first Climate Congress event Saturday which will run
through its closing event in November, with one discussion per week. He said if anyone was
interested, they should go to their website and register for the event.
Mr. Wineman added that Green Cambridge was soliciting delegates to represent neighborhoods
and communities, but that one doesn’t have to be a delegate to show up and participate.
Mr. Kelley read through his presentation (Attachment A).
Mr. Kelley explained that he and Mr. Durbin had been meeting with the residents of Cambridge’s
Senior Centers throughout the month of September as part of Preparedness Month, and in
addition to hearing what the resident had to say, the difficulty in communicating with the senior
population presented its own lesson. Reaching this audience was important, he said, but even in
locations with staff, there are difficulties in conveying necessary information or even getting the
meetings to happen.
During the presentation, he noted that events like the drought conditions currently experienced by
Massachusetts blends the multiple time periods that we typically association with a crisis because
it has both long-term and accumulating acute issues.
Mr. Kelley said that a Public Health official was slated for the October meeting, and said he
would like to see the school department during a following month as well. He said that he and
Mr. Durbin are also talking to more businesses and senior housing residents over the coming
months. They are planning on talking with the manager and residents at the Manning Apartments
at length, where people are moving frequently from room to room, and ask them what happens
when your community is in such a state of flux.
He also recounted conversations with seniors who are concerned that they will fall and die, and
no one will know that they are dead until they start to smell. He said that is a reoccurring fear that
we have heard. The committee should explore having public meetings with the larger
communities sometime in late winter or early spring, he continued, so that the committee can
express to people that we’ve done a good job bringing, or at least trying to bring, people into the
discussion.

Continuing, Mr. Kelley said the Black Lives Matter movement is a really good example of a
movement that has sprung out of an eons old problem, but now cities have problems with
coordinating events with the group, and working with them has proven difficult as they have been
tough to contact via email.
He said that he had recently attended a presentation by the former deputy director of FEMA, and
he heard confirmation of a truism that if you know your neighbors and are able to control crises at
the local level, then the professionals can focus on issues that they are best at.
Ms. Holloway asked if the Committee was still considering recommendations to the city, and
whether that was still part of the report.
Mr. Kelley responded in the affirmative, he said that is a major component of the report, but the
final report should be about what the committee wants it to be about.
Mr. Aidinoff suggested that the committee create two categories of information for the report. He
explained that the committee had talked about large ideas, and also identified a couple concrete
things that they shouldn’t lose. All the service providers do a good job keeping the city going, for
example, but if seniors are worried about dying in their home, then how do we address that? How
do we address heat island effect? He said the group should create a check list of very concrete
issues.
Mr. Kelley said that creating a checklist of specifics and then broader list of generalities was
possible. He asked whether anyone else had ideas for the final presentation. He added that
members should feel free to take the conversation anywhere they want. Think about the format
this thing might take. We have a budget, and are not likely to spend it all. We suggested the
Committee could try to work through basement flooding mitigation with a person in Area 4,
helping them work through the DPW flier. Not buy the items, he said, but going through the
motions, watching the installation, taking videos to post if possible online. He said if the
Committee did this, they could probably get help from people to do the shoot, expertise on going
door to door. He added that he is also interacting with people building a phone based app. He
recommended that members consider reading The Art of Neighboring, which, even as a biblical
book that took lessons from scripture, was applicable on whether you’re a Christian or not.
Ms. Holloway said that she wanted to be on team to developing communities, give
recommendations, build neighborhoods, and look at best practices around the nation, such as
holding neighborhood block parties.
Mr. Wineman said the word he uses for such capacity building is mutual aid.
Ms. Holloway sad that it feels like there are bits of their work that needed to be fleshed out a little
more. What are the gaps that they would look at, what are our recommendations?

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley asked the Committee to consider themes that they might want to further explore, such
as energy stability. The gas shortage in North Carolina had demonstrated the fragility of our own
energy systems, he said. We are near the end of just about every distribution system.

Mr. Kelley said he is hearing that one of the specifics is what can be done to build neighborhoods
with mutual aid in them.

Page 54 of 101
Packet Pg. 105

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman said he had been thinking about a similar structure. The three overarching
categories he had considered were: 1) Resources, we heard a recommendation from CDD for
solar chargers for cell phones, food, water, etc.; 2) which came out of emergency response is
interagency communication, seems really critical; and 3) neighborhood level community and
mutual aid. There may be a better way to classify efforts, but this is a version of distinguishing
our goals. Connected to the neighborhood piece, he continued, we need to hear from the
neighborhoods themselves, and can’t make a recommendation without first talking with them.
Perhaps inviting some delegate here, or going out, but something so that people in neighborhoods
are part of the process, so something is on the ground. If people get another set of
recommendations, they will yawn.
Mr. Kelley said Mr. Durbin is working on setting up meetings with neighborhoods associations,
though he admitted that even they may represent a small section of society.
Mr. Wineman continued that the other piece that I think is critically important is attention to
implementation. What brought this to my attention was buying a charger, but you can’t buy them
easily. He recounted the story he told at a previous meeting about going to multiple stores in
Cambridge for a charger. The vulnerability people are making these recommendations to the
public with the assumption that they will be carried out, but they don’t seem to give any attention
to how it might be implemented. We need an implementation strategy, he said.
Mr. Aidinoff said he wanted to piggyback on the second comment and focus on points of failure.
Neighborhood association will give us a perspective, he said, and you often hear people recount
the difficulty in connecting to communities. We added equitably to our definition of resiliency, he
reminded, and said we need to keep attention to that.
Mr. Kelley said they had to make sure they aggressively figure out who is not at the table. Did we
hear the voice of the homeless?
Mr. Spears said that they were the most vulnerable, and they should get more attention.
Ms. Holloway said in thinking about this process, she really liked the parallel between building
communities and connective tissue. What holds people together? What is the sinew? How are
ideas exchanged? Where is the resource guide?
Mr. Spears responded that they should go where most people go. To talk to seniors, go to senior
center, for homeless go to homeless center.
Mr. Kelley said he would not have thought of the senior center. We can reach out to Vincent to
talk, he said. He said that he’d gone to several presentations from state of NY on preparedness,
he’s been to two so far and will probably go to a third. He said each time it’s always the same
slides and same material, but different people. Even though the course is the same, interesting to
see how the presentations change based on the presenter, he said.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Dmytryk agree that the Committee should take Marc’s idea about checklists very concretely
and start generating a list. Organizing a hierarchy of resiliency issues similar to CCVA
vulnerability mapping presented by Mr. Owen O’Riordan was a good idea, and they could do the
same for their issues through various neighborhoods and communities throughout the city. Many
of the issue we’ve talked about would probably fit in one of those categories, he said. He said
they could also study how communication might work through those levels.

Mr. Spears said several of the churches have food pantries, and they could go to them to ask
about vulnerable populations.

Mr. Spears responded that many of these shelters are run by the faith communities themselves.
Ms. Holloway said that Jose Alvarez, the former President and CEO of Stop & Shop, now teaches
at HBS on food distribution issues, and that he is wired to these issues.
Mr. Spears asked if they should reach out to Salvation Army.
Ms. Holloway asked whether they could create a resource handbook.
Ms. Spears recounted that he had worked on this before when Mayor Sullivan was in office, and
said the city has a lot of programs that people don’t know about. He said one of their tasked was
to develop a website for trouble youth. It was not too late for kids that didn’t go to college or
might have been in trouble, but they wanted to create one place to learn about all the resources
available to help them take the next steps.
Mr. Aidinoff asked how the program went.
Mr. Spear said that the most effective resource was his connection to his community. He noticed
patterns of kids not going to school or such and reached out to them.
Mr. Kelley said that the Committee could go to the Margaret Fuller house to understand their
work.
Ms. Holloway asked if there is such a thing as creating a neighborhood resiliency score card. This
is the way to measure things in the city, and get an understanding on how to close the gap, she
said.
Mr. Kelley said that they do not have something like that. He said he tried to get grad students to
develop a rubric to measure resiliency, but as of yet had not had any takers yet. He said he hoped
to view WE ACT in Manhattan, and is trying to figure out what others are doing and steal from
those models.
Ms. Holloway said that they could come up with their own.
We could, Mr. Kelley said, and gave the example that he thought a gun is important for
resiliency, but others will disagree. During bike trip from Houlton, ME, he asked many people
what would make them feel safe, many said their gun or the 2nd amendment. The more rural they
are the more likely they are to say that. His only point is, we need to be intentional about how we
express our view of resiliency.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said that they’ve been in touch with several clerical people in the area, and
communities of faith are important to touch base.

Ms. Holloway said that was what the scorecard could do.
Mr. Wineman said he would suggest a stress test.

Page 56 of 101
Packet Pg. 107

2.2.c

Mr. Durbin reminded the Committee that the CCVA had already identified the highest areas of
vulnerabilities, and the DPW was working to address those. He asked how what they planned
added that work?
Mr. Aidinoff agreed, asking how the Committee would complement that scorecard. How do we
help residents bear the load of stressful events?
Ms. Holloway recommended a Malcolm Gladwell book The Tipping Point. She also asked how
they replicate the people like Mr. Spears that are connected to their communities. How do we
encourage and account for such individuals?
Mr. Spears said that many people are more connected that the committee may think, and said that
even homeless persons are connected and use internet to find services, they know how to survive.
Mr. Kelley said he is reading a book on neighboring, and block parties are really important to
that. It recommends developing a map that everyone could record their information on and pass
out to neighborhood.
Mr. Spears reminded the Committee that different groups provide different services. They know
who is going to cause problems and get resources.
Mr. Kelley said it sounded like Christina from Margaret Fuller house might be a useful resource
as someone who knows the kids and what they might need to succeed.
Mr. Spears said local police officers are a good outlet as well, they know a lot of the people out
on the street, they grew up here, and they know the families.
Mr. Dmytryk pointed out the challenge of getting to know people in the neighborhood. He said he
lived in a 42 unit building, and was on the board of trustees, but only knew the name of one
person that lives on his floor.
Mr. Kelley added that he was politician, and he doesn’t even know the vast majority of people
surrounding him. The challenge we face is creating a model where we feel comfortable making
those connections, he said.
Ms. Holloway said it would be great to have a neighborhood resiliency handbook, and pilot it in
her neighborhood.
Mr. Spears thought that the problems of building a community in a neighborhood were very
different than if one was in a building with only one door, where you have something of a captive
audience.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said he imagined several neighborhoods have fire departments and other resources
that will help in response, and also the heat island would be lower in some areas, which makes us
think about resource allocation.

Mr. Kelley explained that he gave out coffee and donuts during the election, but it is still hard to
get people to stop and talk.
Ms. Dillard reflected that to build familiarity you need to be in same location multiple times. If
people see each other on a reoccurring basis, it become easily to place them and remember them.

Page 57 of 101
Packet Pg. 108

2.2.c

Ms. Dillard said that she has a friend in Cambridge whose community has block parties, and also
a neighborhood website, like a forum where people could post information and event. If every
neighborhood has something like that it would be helpful.
Mr. Kelley showed the NextDoor app to the group.
Mr. Seidel said we have an opportunity to make draft stress test to send over to CDD. We’d like
CDD to take our core draft and work up a working model, he said.
Mr. Wineman said that the group is coalescing around the stress test idea, but I don’t think CDD
could operate such a thing. We could gather that information, but he worried about what happens
to it. This falls under the same issue as before about implementation.
Mr. Kelley reminded the Committee that the end goal is a report to the mayor outlining what we
did, what they learned, what got them excited, what they were not excited about, and offer a
checklist on things and recommendations to address issues. He asked if that was that a video? An
impressive PowerPoint? A graphic novel?
Ms. Holloway drew the conversation back to neighborhood community meetings. She thought
spending time thinking about the form of the report seemed like putting the cart before the horse.
Mr. Kelley said he was trying to take them both together.
Mr. Aidinoff said he did not wish to belabor the point, but there would be some stuff where we
want interactive graphics, and others that we actually want the mayor to spend money on
something to generate information, but the format of the presentation should be secondary.
Ms. Holloway asked if the Committee’s recommendation could be to spend money or buy
resources for the city, or perhaps implement a 3-5 year plan on capital investments that improve
resiliency.
Mr. Spears asked about a list of issues that different neighborhoods could address.
Mr. Aidinoff repeated his suggestion of a complement to the list of DPW graphics.
Mr. Kelley asked if they were solid on the scorecard idea.
Mr. Aidinoff said he liked the term stress test. Some way to evaluate a neighborhood’s needs that
isn’t based on giving grades.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said when he went to the senior center, he ask how people got along with each other.
Someone said that people often die there, and the residents don’t want to get to know someone
that they know will be gone. And there are no grief counselors to help. The people in my
neighborhood don’t die, he said, but they do move.

Mr. Kelley agrees that there could be some way to measure.
Mr. Durbin said that he was interested in the differences between preparedness and resiliency,
where they strengthen each other, but also where they were distinct processes. He advocated that
the Committee consider how the city closes out an event, or decided that an emergency is over, is

Page 58 of 101
Packet Pg. 109

2.2.c

Mr. Seidel added that some neigh hoods will face issues, and some won’t, but if his neighborhood
is never going to have a flood then I don’t need to build resiliency to that event. Adding to Mr.
Durbin’s point, he said we need to address specific problems, and learn how to address them.
Mr. Kelley said one of the challenge is that the city can’t easily address the local issues. He gave
the example of rodents on Dudley St. In that example, there was a very concrete area, he knew
the people involved, and yet coming to solution was difficult because there were also mitigating
circumstances. We develop the model at local level, and then test it out.
Mr. Wineman repeated that the challenge of building mutual aid is on an order of difficulty above
everything else. As society and governments, we have the tools, but we aren’t doing it. In order to
build mutual aid we need to change our culture. If I’m not wrong, he said, in our recommendation
we need to have full breath of issues, and highlight the mutual aid problem.
Mr. Kelley said it sounds like the overview of larger issues.
Mr. Seidel asked Mr. Wineman if one can create a checklist that leads to mutual aid.
Mr. Wineman said that if you could create a checklist of things that flow out of mutual aid, yes,
that is easy. But this whole idea needs an analysis, strategy and study.
Ms. Holloway said she gets excited about this, because it’s not only a way to be resilient but solve
problems.
Adding to Mr. Seidel’s point, Mr. Aidinoff asked if are there things we could do to develop that
aspect of a checklist that leads to mutual aid. He said they could also think about how
communities coalesce seasonally. Summer has block parties. During Halloween you talk to
parents and kids. During the debate the previous night, people were friendlier in bars than he’d
never seen them. How can those experiences be repeated, he wondered.
Mr. Kelley said the city has a role in supporting such events, but perhaps not building. There are
never any tools to building block parties from the city.
Ms. Holloway said the City has done an amazing job organizing people at the meetings she’d
been to, but perhaps the city could been better at developing the community aspects of events.
Mr. Kelley said if we had a toolkit that was specific to your neighborhood, it could provide both a
way to improve social connective tissue and also addresses the neighborhood’s challenges.
Ms. Holloway said we have become resilient by educating ourselves, there is an advantage when
we are no longer worried about certain things.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

an important part of resiliency. Neighborhoods might have the same resources before an event,
but how emergency resources are doled out after an event can have a huge impact and no one is
talking about that.

Mr. Seidel turned back to the toolkit. Would the Committee offer things for neighborhoods to do,
and make suggestions on where to do them, such as have a block party or play softball.
Mr. Spears said another time we meet all the neighbors is after a snow storm, everyone is out
shoveling.

Page 59 of 101
Packet Pg. 110

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley asked how you take that to the next level. How to you get to the next level to having a
relationship with someone?

Ms. Dillard said she didn’t think you necessarily need to have a relationship with most of your
neighbors or even know them, but just know that you will be able to count on each other to solve
certain issues.
Mr. Seidel asked who is writing this report.
Mr. Kelley said he assumed he would do most of it. Members of the Committee only signed up
for the meetings and he was not expecting anything else. He added that he and Mr. Durbin were
likely to do most of the work.
Mr. Dmytryk said he hoped they put something in the report about how to keep the process going.
To develop the process, and continue our work. We may create something good but no one may
know about it.
Mr. Durbin gave an update on planned tours to the areas dams and meeting with Jose Alvarez.
Mr. Kelley said that it was decided on the Department of Public Health for October, and School
Committee for November.
Mr. Wineman asked when the report would be completed.
Mr. Kelley responded that they should have the report done by around June/July. He also said the
Committee could cancel the December date as many members are likely to be with family, or
they could try to reschedule.
Mr. Aidinoff asked that the Committee consider senior issues for January.
Ms. Holloway asked whether the Committee should start work streams on several of the projects
that they’ve identified.
Mr. Kelley responded that he could do that individually with members and asked who might be
interested. Ms. Kubik, Ms. Holloway, and Ms. Dillard responded in the affirmative.
Mr. Wineman said he was worried about not having someone from homeless population. If we
want to include most vulnerable, they have to be included.
Mr. Kelley thanked everyone for their attendance and closed the meeting.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Spears said that he tends to assemble a team to help shoveling for people in the

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Members present:

Sonia Andujar; Gary Dmytryk; Emily Harrison; Julia Holloway; Craig
Kelley, Chair; Sam Seidel; Tony Spears; Steve Wineman

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Guest Speaker:

Amanda Chen, Director, Salvation Army Bridging the Gap

Mr. Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:36 p.m.
He announced that the Committee had a special visitor as the scheduled representative from
Cambridge’s Public Health Department had to cancel. He introduced Ms. Amanda Chen, the
Director of the Cambridge Salvation Army’s Bridging the Gap program. He said Committee
members had expressed that they wanted to cover some of the less fortunate, more vulnerable
populations in Cambridge. The conversations tend to focus on climate change-related issues, but
the committee has stated it can and should think about broader issues.
Ms. Chen introduced herself and the Bridging the Gap program, which focuses on juvenile
justice. Some of the initiatives included classes at the high school extension location, juvenile
justice (jail) diversion program, services for men with addictions, and resume writing.
She also talked about the Cambridge Salvation Army, which has a shelter with 35 beds, which
can be expanded by 15 beds during overflow emergencies, such as flooding. The shelter also has
a daycare for homeless children, and currently cares for 42 children. She said she works with
those populations. She explained that while she is new to Cambridge, serving as Director for 1
year, she has worked on this for 7 years.
Mr. Kelley asked whether he was correct in saying that Salvation Army had 35 beds with 15 in
reserve.
Ms. Chen affirmed the number, and included that the shelter also ran a lunch for 100+ people per
day, and that showers and laundry were available. The ‘homeless court,’ which meets once a
month for charges like loitering and so forth, used to be in Medford, but through advocating it
was moved to the Cambridge Salvation Army to allow social workers to help populations using
the facility. She expanded on the Bridging the Gap program, which was a really good
collaboration between Salvation Army and the court system to divert youth out of the prison
pipeline. If juveniles are diverted, then they are less likely to end up in jail and that is her focus.
She said they have kids from Malden and Dorchester too, as they come through Cambridge
courts, though the majority of kids are from Cambridge.
A member of the Committee asked what are some of challenges facing her youth living in
Cambridge?

October 25, 2016—795 Mass Ave, City Hall, Ackerman Room: 6:30 P.M.

Ms. Chen said the biggest challenge for families is affordability, which should not come as a
shock to anyone. A major issue for children that live in public housing is that they grow up here
in Cambridge, make connections to local churches, communities, and families, but when they

Page 61 of 101
Packet Pg. 112

2.2.c

Ms. Chen also noted that some of the stores in Cambridge are really expensive. Mothers that go
to shelters have to buy expensive diapers, and then the bags to carry them. 10 cents per bag might
not seem like a lot, but it adds up, she said.
Other problem is the number of youth that have been affected by violence. She said she worked
previously in Worcester, where there was gang violence, but it is here, too. She said she works
with two youth that had murders outside of their home and it does affect the youth in her
diversion program.
Mr. Dmytryk asked how old the people in the program are.
Ms. Chen said typically youth are 15-18, and the men are 18-50. They are in a program, such as
Umoja, a Swahili word for “unity” which is the Salvation Army’s men’s program for adult male
drug users at or staying at the Salvation Army. They have transportation challenges and
challenges in finding a job in Cambridge where if you don’t have a degree it’s difficult. Who do
we want this city to be for? she asked. Can we make it so youth can stay here, they like it here.
Could we provide unique rent subsidies for people who grew up in Cambridge?
Mr. Wineman asked if Ms. Chen has talked with people in Cambridge Housing Authority.
Ms. Chen said no, not yet.
Mr. Spears said there is a long waiting list for housing in Cambridge, sometimes as much as 10
years.
Mr. Wineman was particularly struck for youth that grow up here and then can’t live here, he
said.
Ms. Chen said that in an unexpected way, Cambridge’s housing program can promote pregnancy.
Women with children or who are pregnant move up the line. It doesn’t happen often, she said, but
it does happen.
Ms. Harrison asked what percentage of the housing stock is renter occupied versus owner
occupied.
Ms. Chen said she wasn’t sure, but there was an initiative for landlords to allow renters to stay.
Perhaps there are elderly that are having trouble paying taxes as well.
Ms. Harrison said there are charity based organizations are doing some of this work, and asked
about the relation between Salvation Army and other programs that are doing similar work.

turn 18 and try to move out, they are often cut off from their families and communities because
they cannot afford is live in the city. She asked how these young people who grow up here stay in
the city and Bunker Hill Community College and a part-time job, along with expensive stores and
food, add to the problem. Young and Hip does not work so well for homeless kids from an
affordability standpoint.

Ms. Chen said Cambridge Salvation Army is funded by the city, and she felt very supported here.
The shelter doesn’t get a lot, but it is funded, included day care. The diversion program she runs
is statewide, is funded by the City and there are not a lot of programs like it. The DA, via the

Page 62 of 101
Packet Pg. 113

2.2.c

Cambridge Police Department, has its own diversion program. For youth, instead of going into
the justice system for minor crime, completing a diversion program can alleviate the charges..
Mr. Kelley asked if CPD engages with Bridging the Gap.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Chen said if youth get in trouble CPD has a program, and her program is different. It’s a 12
week life guidance program that tries help youth build skills to reconstruct their life. They have a
curriculum and work on good decision making, self-esteem, social skills and anger management
and help the youth find jobs. They work with northern light that donates laptops to youth when
they graduate.
Most of the youth are high need low risk, they are not dangerous, she said. Common feedback is
youth feeling overlooked. They take youth on fieldtrips, and offer youth pastor support. She also
runs a program where youth come and do community service. After graduating the program, the
youth are usually out of the court system. They may come back as youth leaders and maybe get
money for jobs from YouthWorks.
Mr. Kelley asked if Ms. Chen was a case worker.
Ms. Chen said she does work cases, but is not a counselor. She also does intervention for youth
who are on house arrest and so forth and works to keep kids out of the adult system if they are
already in the juvenile justice system. She explained that the high school extension is part of
CRLS, an alternative school for Cambridge students. She runs run a class there. Some of the
Bridging the Gap youth are drop outs, some have graduated, etc.
Mr. Kelley said the extension school used to be the place where we send problem students, now
it’s for students that ran out of time to graduate, and now study as they work. They can go up to
22.
Ms. Harrison asked if Bridging the Gap was about creating a network for people about to go into
court system, or preventative, or reaching out to the community.
Ms. Chen said it depends on the case. The Court can decide if someone goes to diversion at
Bridging the Gap of, if the youth has already been on probation, maybe send them there after the
fact. In Cambridge it seems to be more of a court program than a community program. Youth
have to follow the rules in and out of the program.
Mr. Kelley asked what happens after youth leave the program.
Ms. Chen said hopefully they don’t reoffend, they get jobs, go to college, and I follow up with
them. The biggest goal is getting them out of the system.
Mr. Kelley asked, “If I’m 16 and go into the juvenile system, they might send me to you before
they heard my case or not?”
Ms. Chen said if it’s your first time, they will go to diversion. If it’s multiple offense then they go
into probation. Depends on situation.
Ms. Harrison asked how do people find the program.

Page 63 of 101
Packet Pg. 114

2.2.c

Ms. Chen said they are very accessible to the courts, but are trying to be better about outreach.
There are a lot of other options that kids might go to before us.
Ms. Harrison asked where most of the kids from in Cambridge are coming from.

Mr. Wineman asked on a broader level, if there were an extreme weather event or other
emergency that was disruptive, how would that affect the homeless population in the city under
two variables, if the shelters and Salvation Army is functional, and another if they were no longer
functional?
Ms. Chen, who is personally certified for emergency disaster services, said the Salvation Army
would go out to emergency situations on site and provide emergency disaster services (EDS),
they are trained in emergency situations, providing shelter, clothing, generators, whatever is
needed and they have their own backup generator. This weekend we got 15 people into the shelter
over capacity to meet demand, she said. We try to be dry (no people who have been drinking), but
we don’t want people to freeze to death. That poses challenges for violence.
Sometimes the Salvation Army offers bagged lunches. Overnight guests have to leave the shelter
during the day, but there is a drop-in center from 9-2. Dinner is just for people staying at the
shelter and is cooked by Salvation Army staff with guests’ help. You can take showers and do
laundry. Everything is cooked at the Salvation Army by the men in the program. Anyone can
drop in for lunch. Ms. Chen said that people who sleep on someone’s couch are not always listed
as homeless. We can only allow people into the shelter if they have a valid ID due to the daycare,
so sometimes we turn people away.
Mr. Wineman asked if there a census of homeless people that live on the streets.
Mr. Kelley said yes, HUD asked municipalities to do so. It’s taken on one night in January.
Mr. Wineman asked if there are emergency plans to deal with people who sleep on the streets.
Ms. Chen said it’s not exactly clear what they do, but it’s tough to send a drunk back outside on a
cold winter night.
Ms. Harrison said there are ways of categorizing groups that don’t access services and asked they
have data on recent immigrant groups or different faith affiliations that don’t access the services.
Ms. Chen responded that with court-ordered Bridging the Gap, it would be unethical to push
religion. She understands the perceptual challenges of a faith-based group. Some kids definitely
feel like they will be judged, but they are pretty successful at having other groups come. Its nice
to see them feel comfortable.
Ms. Chen added that this is an issue for groups that come to the United States, they feel afraid to
access services.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Chen said most come from Newtown Court, and some coming from Windsor street.

Mr. Dmytryk asked how the situation differs in terms of living expenses and buying in Worcester
versus Cambridge.

Page 64 of 101
Packet Pg. 115

2.2.c

Ms. Chen said you could get a job and pay rent easier, and there were more opportunities for
entry level jobs in Worcester. But youth get to see alternative models in Cambridge, even if from
far away, and there is more confidence in the kids here, but they also feel stigmatized.

Ms. Chen said if they don’t graduate the program they go back to court. She added that Bridging
the Gap has an 80 percent non-reoffending rate in the state, and the Cambridge Salvation Army
program currently has a 70 success rate but that program is new.
Ms. Harrison asked what people in Ms. Chen’s position need and don’t have, besides money. If
she could decide, what would she do better?
Ms. Chen responded that having a great after care would be helpful, and having more connections
connection in the community. Just being able to talk about this issue is helpful, for community
members to talk about juvenile justice, instead of just pipelining them into prison. She would like
to start a mentoring program. Bridging the Gap is not a magic bullet and if youth reoffend as
adults they can be in serious trouble. She refers youth to jobs but for some kids, simply staying in
school is a big step. Her program is after school. They eat dinner with the kids every day and
complete their community hours but there is no weekend program. A great after-school program
with partnerships and connections would be good. She would like that for her and the kids.
Mr. Seidel asked what type of offences she sees.
Ms. Chen said that while they get lots of type of offenses, many are school related. Throwing a
pencil, disrupting class, etcetera, and those students shouldn’t be thrown into the court system.
Others include stabbing, setting fire, and robbery. They have gotten those in Cambridge, but she
doesn’t always know for confidentiality reasons.
Mr. Dmytryk asked if there were a lot of immigrant students in the program.
Ms. Chen said yes, even those that have only been here a few months and some are
undocumented. She is currently working with 10 kids, and the program has a rolling admission.
Start out with self-esteem and then rights and responsibilities
Mr. Kelley asked the largest class size she had had.
Ms. Chen responded ten was the usual number, and they are still trying to grow. They are co-ed
and that can make talking about some issues tough. Some of the kids are as young as 12 and she
is hoping for a middle school system. There are a bunch of grandmothers, too, that she is
working with.
Ms. Harrison returned to Cambridge violence. How are kids finding different forms of support,
she asked.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley asked what happens to kids after three months. Once they graduate the program, is
their record is expunged?

Ms. Chen said that her kids say there are gangs in Cambridge, even though the police won’t
discuss. She has kids that claim gang affiliation and kids needing to be separated for that reason.
And parent support is huge- she could use help with that.

Page 65 of 101

2.2.c

Mr. Spears said there should be training program or something to help. It is frightening to see
baby-faced kids reporting to a probation officer.

Ms. Chen said Tupperware, you can ding it up, throw it around, drop it on the floor, but it won’t
shatter. It may be ugly, but it works. Overcoming obstacles like failing your GED (which she did
multiple times), keeping going no matter what you go through. And as a community, helping
people keeping going as a mission.
Mr. Harrison said that every student she comes into contact with from a difficult background has
someone championing their achievement. Someone took an individual interest in them.
Mr. Seidel asked what are things that she thinks we should be thinking about to bring resiliency to
the city.
Ms. Chen said affordability is a huge part of the equation. Make everything accessible and
affordable. That’s the number one thing she thinks of. Being more aware of/connected to services
and each other. Mentoring programs for the youth. Helping everyone feel a part of Cambridge.
Keeping it for families.
Ms. Holloway said perhaps they hit on something. One person can make a difference, one act.
Part of this future report should be that the world is a crazy place, and how to tell a story about
resiliency is important.
Ms. Chen said feeling like you connected to someone makes a huge difference. This system of
responsibility to each other is what resiliency is built on. “Sometimes not having a choice can
make you resilient.” Having faith helped her as well but it is hard to go to church when you are
drifting. Motivation is a huge piece, need to build self-esteem in some of the kids. “I always
thought I could do it, but I just didn’t know how.” Relating to people is an important way to reach
the youth, coming from where they are.
Mr. Wineman said there is a dance between the micro level, the kid that brings someone into the
system (“This person helped me”) or goes and gives back, to not ever loose that focus, but also
look at systems as well.
Mr. Spears noted that inner city kids are naturally resilient. He suggested “Class Divided” on
HBO, about how money separates people who enjoy a great school across from a low income
development.
Ms. Chen wondered if it was possible to channel the hardness into a better effort at school. For at
risk youth, you have to go the extra mile and that can be very successful. Youthworks is all about
at risk youth. She’s fired kids who don’t work properly. They need to understand what it is like to
work. In order to survive, you need to be employable.
Mr. Seidel noted that low barrier to entry options can be less useful.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel asked what do you think about when you think resiliency?

Everything is online now. People have to take tests and fill out forms on line for just about any
type of employment. Learning to operate online is an important employment skill.

Mr. Wineman said he was thinking about robust systems.
Mr. Dmytryk said looking toward future months, the Committee will have to start wrapping up,
and asked if they should start doing that now? They could review some of that material, what do
we want to keep from each meeting.
Mr. Kelley said that is the purpose of SLACK, which isn’t getting much traction. Next month
they are hoping to meet with Public Health Department, hopefully get someone from School
Department after that.
Mr. Wineman reflected on a couple of strands to pull together. The climate congress is in
progress, and is currently in the middle of series of weekly panel discussions. The panel
discussions which he facilitates focuses on bridging discrepancies, such as stage of life, access to
resources, wealth and country of origin. People are being very open and vulnerable. Isolation
makes people afraid. What would happen to me if there was a flood? I never know anyone in my
building? Some of the community building that we are talking about here is happening at the
climate congress. In some way the most striking thing is the hunger for community. Green
Decade has the talks online on Youtube.
Ms. Holloway said that’s her passion, she wants to talk more about that. How can we drive
toward more tangible recommendations toward community building?
Ms. Harrison asked if there is money for neighborhood block parties? Not the big parties, but
local things.
Ms. Spears said that some of the churches have those, but they pull donations.
Mr. Kelley said scaling those events to take the models and events and build bigger events is a
challenge. They need to be done right to be useful.
Ms. Holloway said one of the things that can come out of the meetings are the multiple levels to
resiliency- systems need to mesh with the individual.
Mr. Seidel noted that something we could do at a neighborhood level is to figure out “choice/no
choice” part. Snow is a ‘no choice’ issue, you have to deal with it. But flooding and raking a
drain?
Ms. Harrison suggested maybe knocking on the neighbor’s door and offering a rake.
Mr. Wineman said that knocking on a neighbor’s door is the big obstacle. Talking across our
various differences, coming to a conversation is the challenge.
Mr. Seidel noted that in his two unit building a lot of the joint decisions are handled through a
mutually understood but awkward dance even though they have a shared vested interest.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel noted that tonight was the opposite of “the City should…” It was about one person
with one person.

Ms. Halloway noted that a social fabric’s strength is unknown until it is tested. How can we
figure out that strength before it’s needed?

Mr. Seidel commented on the balance between reciprocal thinking and feeling you’re being used,
played for a chump.
Ms. Harrison noted that a lot of the issue is messaging. Her kids, in her Harvard House, are very
different and having a project and helping them get involved can be tricky. Australia does it well.
Ms. Andujar said that she did a successful TV program. Saying “Hello” is huge. She’s out of her
comfort zone here and that can be tough to break through.
Mr. Kelley thanks everyone for their time and dismissed the meeting.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Members present:

Sonia Andujar; Gary Dmytryk; Julia Holloway; Craig Kelley, Chair;
Sean Rogers; Sam Seidel; Tony Spears; Steve Wineman

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Guest Speaker:

Kari Sasportas, Manager, Community Resilience & Preparedness,
Cambridge Public Health Department; Nancy Rihan-Porter,
Coordinator, Injury & Violence Prevention Program

Mr. Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:37 p.m. He thanked Ms. Holloway for hosting the
Committee for a discussion at her home, and for putting the Committee in contact with Jose
Alvarez. He introduced the two guest speakers, thanked them for coming, and explained that the
City contracts with Cambridge Health Alliance to provide health department services. They run a
host of programs and services for the City, the most noticeable being placing nurses in Cambridge
Public Schools. Claude Jacob is the Chief Public Health Officer for the City and manages CHA.
He then turned it over to Ms. Sasportas.
Ms. Sasportas explained the overall workings of the Community Resilience and Preparedness
Program (see attached slides). She emphasized the department’s attention to the human element
when it comes to resilience, building social connectedness, building a strong foundation and good
design to building resiliency. A solid base of wellness is the best way to help people withstand
adversity. People with flexibility are better able to withstand problems. She explained that it is
sometimes difficult for her to talk about the human element of resiliency because she’s a trained
scientist, but is also trained as a social worker. In her new role, pulling from the social element,
the Department helps to identify and build upon the social determinants of health. She talked
about leveraging the strengths of the community and its resources. We are best when we are
connected, she said. Resilience is a word from physics, meaning to “rebound,” adapting quickly
to adversity.
Mr. Wineman noted that that was the Committee’s theme as well, and said she was preaching to
the choir on that. How do you make that happen, he asked?
Ms. Sasportas said that such initiatives are connected to existing public health and emergency
responses, but also come in community well-being promotion. It’s Public Health 3.0, with both
core services and non-traditional partnerships. When we are talking about really unlikely events
most of the time, but the preparation and organizing is immediately useful and Public Health view
“emergency preparedness” through its own professional lens.
Ms. Holloway said that the Committee has been discussing a resiliency neighborhood score card,
and asked how CHA evaluates whether a community is resilient or not?

November 29, 2016—795 Mass Ave, City Hall, Ackerman Room: 6:30 P.M.

Ms. Sasportas said that one of her main objectives is to improve the baseline metric of a
community, and create resiliency, which requires good data. How they operationalized these
theories in part of the later presentation, but she wanted to give background and information. She
was excited by the opportunity to talk about what is unique about CHA’s model to community
health compared to other communities.

Page 69 of 101
Packet Pg. 120

She said a lot of structures for funding through various organizations all started with a focus on
individual preparedness to biohazard, natural disasters, and such, but a transition in operational
planning lately has refocused its core concepts to think about community resiliency. This is now
one of the core functions of preparedness and community recovery. Center for Disease Control
(CDC) outlines core capabilities and function of getting to this level, and this is one way to have
some accountability to a final project and the way allocated funds were spent.
Mr. Kelley wanted to go back to funding. He asked if the city’s programs were reimbursed from
federal funds.
Ms. Sasportas responded that federal funds are funneled through the state Department of
Preparedness and Emergency Management and granted directly to the CHA. She said there are
regulatory benchmarks with environmental indicators. Other funds are funneled through health
and medical coordinating groups that have regional districts for public health preparedness. They
also work with multi-disciplinary Health and Medical Coordinating Coalition (HMCC), which
involves public health departments, EMS, hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. They
are building resiliency by not only crossing districts, but disciplines if there is an emergency. This
is very useful in forming new ideas and cross pollenating and also getting resources out more
quickly.
In Massachusetts, each town and city has its own public health department as there is no county
government here. So CHA’s staff is regionalized to compensate for that.
Knowing your neighbors is at the heart of resiliency. The more people who are aware of
neighbors, the better prepared we are. Traditionally, government has been the ‘thing’ in
preparedness, now it’s more people power, an investment in ‘every day’ resiliency. Preparedness,
response & long-term recovery are its three core parts. And it’s a good public health practice.
Mr. Kelley said he liked what he heard, and hoped that they get to the operational point
eventually, but said that it doesn't seem like the “know your neighbor” and “bottom up”
programing is separate from federal funding and programs.
Ms. Sasportas responded that there are mechanisms that they distributed federal funds under
mandate, but also that there is money left over to do work on a community basis.
Ms. Rihan-Porter said that in many cases the resilient part is already happening, and their work is
just to capture what is already going on but it’s tough to categorize it. They seek out what natural
community resources already exist and capitalize on those already in place. It is important to
identify and classify those resources so that they can be implemented on a scalable metric.
Mr. Wineman said that he doesn't see any of the on-the-ground-work that was mentioned,
resiliency on a community level is not operational current in Cambridge, he contended. That is
sort of frightening, illustrating a disconnect the Committee has discussed between large-scale
actors and those on the ground.

2.2.c

Ms. Holloway added that maybe the core of what was said was that there is more connective
tissue than we realize, and maybe what the Committee is expressing is that they are only now
finding out about those connections.

Page 70 of 101
Packet Pg. 121

2.2.c

Mr. Seidel mentioned that when the Margaret Fuller House gives turkeys away for free at
Thanksgiving, that is a social connection, but what is the resilience of such a program if supplies
are limited, and what is the impact to the community in years without. Planning together is crucial
and bottom-up is how much of this work gets done.
Ms. Holloway said that a great take away from this whole process could be communicated as
Cambridge has an abundance of resources, and the idea is to make the shift from one paradigm of
distributing resources and services, to getting access to those systems and getting those systems
have to talk to each other. How do you make it hum together, she asked? There are lots of
resources available, but people don't know how to use or capture those programs. Connecting
people with knowledge and programs is something the Committee could help with.
Mr. Rogers noted that he liked what he was hearing. Maybe we are moving in the right direction,
connecting with the local condo associations and so forth.
Mr. Rihan-Porter said that it is important always to remember that the human factor is huge,
especially in marginalized communities.
Mr. Kelley noted that he agreed with everything said but had seen little evidence of it actually
happening.
Ms. Sasportas explained that when disaster strikes, they are counting on social capital and related
components of resiliency to help neighborhoods and people be strong.
Moving from theory to practice, the CHA is working on







Wellness
Access
Education
Engagement
Self-sufficiency (Go-kits, Urban Agriculture)
Partnerships

The largest take-home message is that we need to work together on everything from racism to
housing access.
Ms. Rihan-Porter noted that “community resilience is a process rather than an outcome.” Her
position is less than 2 years old. She goes far upstream of problems of violence and public health
to stop those problems from manifesting downstream. What strengths do we have that we can
build on to be more resilient? Self-sufficiency is key, such as being able to put out a small fire.
Building communities prevents violence, injury and trauma and CHA is aligning that effort with
various city-wide initiatives.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Rihan-Porter said that they feeling the same struggles. She’s always looking at the social
piece, she said, and the human structure. It’s tough to ‘get’ prevention when it is actually working
and preventing something. She does not have a kit to get people motivated and involved. They
probably only focus on the operational piece and government, but need to focus on organic
actions. Marginalized communities are always the ones that are hit hardest.

Page 71 of 101

2.2.c

Ms. Rihan-Porter explained that Mental Health First Aid is an eight hour course about resiliency
and recovers. The belief that individuals experiencing these challenges can and do get better and
can use their strengths to stay well.

Ms. Rihan-Porte explained that it is about destigmatization, getting rid of the bias around mental
health. At leasing having kindness is a start, it builds community. One of her co-trainers is a CPD
officer. The training helps recognize something before it happens.
The Cambridge Community Response Network is aimed at helping people recover from a
traumatic event like a shooting. They bring in Riverside Community Health Center to help with
this.
Mr. Wineman said that this is great as far as it goes., but it seems like it is government providing
resources rather than building connections between people.
Ms. Rihan-Porter hopes that we’ll get enough Mental Health First Aid trained people, with
enough skills, to just see if everyone’s okay.
Ms. Sasportas noted that they want to transition away from response and improve the baseline
capacities.
Mr. Kelley noted that we do this sort of social engineering/interaction all the time and we want to
get beyond that first stage.
Ms. Sasportas explained that “Homeport” with a trailer with art making activiites centered around
healing, street murals, visual demarcation of entering Cambridgeport as a home is a community
building effort. They are working with the Community Arts Center and DPW, it is something of a
public safety thing.
Mr. Rogers wondered what was left behind after these meetings. CPR, 1st Aid, etc. all leave
something behind.
Ms Rihan-Porter noted that DPW is doing a huge amount of infrastructure work, how can DPW
help build on that for a more resilient community. How can they build more connective tissue?
Ms. Holloway wondered how that connective tissue could be self-generating.
Ms. Rihan-Porter explained that it is also about helping people address issues that are further
away, like the Nepal Earthquake. Reaching out with what the community needs, having different
voices at the resiliency table is often missing.
Mr. Spears said that he’s dealt with shootings and figuring out if the shooter is in or out of the
community how to keep trouble out is an issue.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Halloway noted that there are all these resources, but people cannot find them. Who trolls the
internet looking for that stuff? Maybe the Committee could do that.

Ms. Rihan-Porter explained that self-accountability and neighborhood pride help build resiliency.
We are all our brother’s keeper. But she does not have a way to measure that.

Page 72 of 101
Packet Pg. 123

2.2.c

Ms. Sasportas said that there are a variety of measures, to include Twitter feeds, but the human
element is huge and it’s the process that really counts as they build coalitions and various
partnerships. It is a cycle. “The most revolutionary thing you can do is know yourself.”

Ms. Rihan-Porter asked how those resources are mapped, how is duplication avoided and
resources made available to everyone?
Ms. Sasportas- breaking out of our silos is crucial.
Mr. Spears commented that people do not know how to reach services while Mr. Seidel
commented that people need to identify their own needs, what Mr. Spears commented were their
problems as Mr. Wineman underscored the importance of connecting to each other.
Ms. Rihan-Porter noted that her job was not to identify fixes but rather to get people together to
do it. Community means communicate and unify.
Ms. Halloway said that an aspirational goal is to have more disparate ideas, have conflict in the
container and to learn to tolerate more as other voices join in the conversation. Mr. Spears added
that people can be reached through their relevant leaders.
Ms. Rihan-Porter said that the foundational issues are to identify the most vulnerable. While
everyone has needs, some people can handle them better than others.
Mr. Seidel asked if CHA had applied this in well-resourced neighbors. The answer was ‘no.’
Ms. Sasportas said that they constantly hear from the same core of engaged residents. She’s
trying to listen to what works. Dr. Martin, Boston’s Chief Resiliency Officer, raod the bus and
talked with people and met them where they are, asking “What do you care about?” and similar
questions. There are other best practices, too.
Mr. Wineman said that Karl Hess wrote “Community Technology.” That would be a great
resource.
Ms. Andujar underscored that the transient element is huge.
Mr. Spears said that a transient community like ours poses tough challenges for community
building.
Mr. Rogers asked how one crosses economic boundaries.
Ms. Sasportas said there was literature emerging from the spr anding/delta of bounceback for
resiliency. The are LA County Resiliency-builder tools and information on ACES: Adverse
Childhood Events. Plus Thrive New York City’s mental health work.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Halloway said that making the shift from the old service paradign to a new, connected
paradigm, up and outside that glass system is what we need.

Mr. Wineman said that one measurable item could be the number of people trained in Mental
Health First Aid.
Mr. Seidel asked wehre/how do you measure resiliency with something like Katrina?

Page 73 of 101
Packet Pg. 124

2.2.c

Ms. Sasportas said that baseline community health data is put out by DPH. Self-registration of
people with disabilities could be a possibility.

Ms. Sasportas wondered about a CERT team here? They are adult and kid oriented. Usually AllHazard orientation, skills like a Katrina organization for pre-first responder work.
Mr. Dymtryk said that it is all about building networks such as connecting Ms. Rihan-Porter to
staff at the Salvation Army. Grow the Community Emergency Response Network and make it
more usable.
Ms. Rihan-Porter said that anyone with “resiliency” in their job title/duties should get together to
get a common understanding of what they are doing.
The Committee’s goal Is not to implement things but to have suggestions for how to implement
things.
Ms. Holloway noted that everything is about building connective tissue.
Mr. Kelley thanked Ms. Sasportas and Ms. Rihan-Porter for their time and presentation, and
turned to Committee business.
The minutes were accepted at 8:18 p.m. by unanimous consent.
Mr. Kelley reminded the Committee that there was not be a December meeting. At the January
meeting he would like to invite representatives from the school department. He doesn’t currently
have any group lined up for the February meeting.
Ms. Holloway said that they should invite church groups and leaders.
Mr. Kelley said that Mr. Durbin had been in contact with the Department of Elderly Services and
wanted to know if members would like to be invited to any meeting.
Mr. Kelley said he would touch base with faith based communities, including the Mayor’s
Interfaith Group lead by Denis Simmons, perhaps to discuss for the February meeting.
Mr. Wineman suggested that contact community centers and Margaret Fuller House.
Mr. Kelley said that Mr. Durbin had already been in contact with many of the local groups.
Mr. Dmytryk said that he had never been to the Margaret Fuller House and it might be
informative to visit.
Ms. Holloway suggested art communities.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Rogers asked about creating a network of community responder types.

Mr. Kelley said he has been reaching out to community groups, including PSNA, NCSC, Agassiz
Neighborhood Association, etc. He said that he would like to reach out to Beth Thompson to help
frame our final project to build graphic material.

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman said that in listening to CHA, he couldn’t believe that they didn’t know about work
at Cambridge Salvation Army, and he found himself thinking that rather than compiling a report
that winds up sitting in a drawer, why not take responsibility on ourselves using the resources and
budget to get organizations like that together. They could have their own resiliency congress, they
could hire an organizer to organize neighborhood meetings. We could do the stuff that would be
in the neighborhood report.
Mr. Kelley responded that it does not have to be an either or, but such proposals are second steps.
Mr. Rogers agreed that that is part of a longer process, perhaps they can have test pilots.
Ms. Holloway said that they should always think that what we are doing is building connective
tissue.
Mr. Kelley said that they have money to do both, whether that is a binder of information, a
presentation, we have to have something that looks professional and reads better. This person is
better at the random stuff.
Mr. Rogers asked if they were considering inviting a number of impact groups and having them
talk to each other on the issue of resiliency.
Mr. Wineman said that it would be beneficial to just give them a chance to talk to each other. The
model he offered was of the Climate Congress panels. These have been very focused on outreach,
and include up to 8 people to bridge differences, such as different generations. Those people had
a two hour session and conversation that would continue to include more members.
Mr. Kelley said they are going to have a larger meetings that are for the public, not exactly what
he was saying, but a large gathering.
Mr. Seidel repeated his suggestion that a facilitator could help focus the conversation.
Mr. Kelley said they could take that up that for the post January conversation.
Mr. Kelley closed the meeting and thanked everyone for their attention.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel said perhaps it would be more beneficial to have a facilitator to take a new look at this
issue, and to take some writing work off of the Chair and Assistant.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Members present:

Mark Aidinoff; Suni Dillard; Gary Dmytryk; Emily Harrison; Ethridge
King, Vice Chair; Craig Kelley, Chair; Gail Kubik; Sam Seidel; Tony
Spears; and Steve Wineman.

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Guest Speaker:

Bill Zamparelli, Eversource

Mr. Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:45 p.m. and introduced Bill Zamparelli from
Eversource. He asked Mr. Zamparelli to explain how Cambridge fits into the larger energy grid
around New England.
Mr. Zamparelli began by saying that the regional power-grid is managed by electric professionals
such as New England Power Grid, New England ISO, who deal with supply and demand. These
operators monitor demand on the grid and call up generators to meet that demand. That demand
fluctuates depending on time of day, especially when people go home at the end of the day and
5:00 PM is the peak demand time. Our electric system is supported by series of independent
generators. We are all familiar with fossil fuel generators (#6 diesel), but he said that the industry
is moving toward wind, solar power, and tidal generation.
People need to understand that the regional grid is largest manmade interconnected thing in the
world, he continued. A lot of work went into safety and building precautions against failure. If
you remember the 1960s black out that spread throughout the northeast, it originated in Ohio and
about ¼ of the country went dark. The same protections didn’t exist then, and you saw the impact
spread over a huge swath of the United States. Our modern system is a very complicated process,
a lot of that system exists to short-circuit the spread of outages. Operators also have the ability to
shut down circuits and have breakers and so forth, but supply has to meet demand.

PRESENTATION TO THE
CAMBRIDGE MAYOR’S SPECIAL TASK FORCE ON

During summer months demand from AC and other uses increase demand dramatically. Some
generators are more economical than others and ISO will generally tap the more efficient and
economical generators first. There are bottlenecks in the system and new connections are aimed

Page 76 of 101
Packet Pg. 127

2.2.c

Mr. Zamparelli said that the grid is evolving, and there is a legacy as to how it got to where it is
today. We have equipment that may have been in service since that system first went live 100
years ago. There is a real mix of modern and legacy systems, the challenge is to efficiently
interweave that system and realize that the old equipment may still be perfectly functional.
Eversource is moving to photovoltaics, wind generation, and have power purchase agreements
with homeowners and communities that have photovoltaics to buy excess energy. That has
required a certain amount of engineering to make that possible. The industry is moving toward
battery backup for stations when there is no generation (such as nighttime for PV), but the
technology is not there yet.
You find Elon Musk is doing much of this, he said, perhaps in Nevada, but building the same
station level storage of capacity that can be used elsewhere. Similar development is being made
for solar power to allow a battery to save energy during the day, and use at it night. There was an
interesting show on [PBS’s NOVA program “Search for the Super Battery”] that featured a
perpetual motion machine to store electricity. The technology is a bit beyond me, he said, I’m an
engineer. Another was an ice battery that was used to reduce temperature for AC, to make it
much more efficient. What can happen is exciting and what works will be adopted by the grid.
And ‘net metering” allows people to generate with PV and sell the excess to pay another account.
One city put in 22,000 panels so it is viable but does take up a lot of space.
Mr. Zamparelli stated that the system generates 2.6WM through photovoltaics going on here in
New England. Cambridge is very aggressive at looking at options. He sits on the Cambridge
Environmental & Sustainability group. We often look at renewable options. Many options
perused in Cambridge could be more aggressively considered elsewhere. He stressed that this is
an interesting time with all the technological changes, and both energy companies and
municipalities will need to adapt. The power grid is a good example of successful evolution and
adaptation, at more than 120 years old.
Further changes to that system are inevitable. He said Mr. Kelley had asked him to talk about
islanding. He stated that there is a movement to create micro-grids, a self-contained area to
generate energy themselves. He currently sits on the Kendal Square eco-grid committee. They are
exploring technology to allow Kendall to come off the grid and then go back on as demand
dictates. Islands that come on and off the grid can significantly disrupt the planning capacity of
energy companies, he cautioned. They might generate too much energy when companies island
themselves, and then suddenly find the grid strained from insufficient energy when the microgrids come back online and need energy. Plus there are safety issues.
Eversource can also buy electricity for its customers as it is a distributor not a generator. It
transmits at high levels and meters at the customer level with the bill reflecting the various
entities involved- supply, distribution and about 20 other entities that compete against each other.
Eversource buys electricity as a pass through. We just have so many customers its hard for
another company to compete with our rate. Every 6 months we change our rate based on cost of
electricity in NE, right now it is very low. If you understand how electricity is generated, he
explained, spot marketing is when electricity is generated from gas after the gas needed for

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

at bringing new and cheaper generation sources to New England. In New England, we have 41
locations under development. When completed, it will save about $800 million annually. Once
these improvement are made, it will significantly reduce the cost of energy in NE. This
investments will have a significant impact on all communities. Another aspect of his job is
economic development, and that means lower the cost of energy so that companies can expand
production and provide jobs.

Page 77 of 101
Packet Pg. 128

2.2.c

Eversource is in the process of increasing the gas pipeline Access Northeast, which will be
dedicated to electric generation for the region, guaranteeing that there will be inexpensive electric
generation by gas. They will be storing natural gas in liquid form, up to 10 million gallons, during
the summer months when it is cheap. This can be put back into the system in Feb and March
when peak consumption is occurring, and because it was purchased during July, it makes energy
very cheap.
It’s very difficult for New England to compete with energy rich areas of the United States, he
said, but this is a step. There are a lot of things going on.
Mr. Kelley asked if he would talk more about Cambridge’s energy needs.
Mr. Zamparelli began by talking about the resiliency in Cambridge. We have a unique history
here of how electricity was developed in Cambridge. Formerly, a single company existed just to
provide electricity to the City, the Cambridge Electric and Light Company. That became
Commonwealth Energy, then NStar and, with another merger, Eversource now serves
Connecticut, parts of New Hampshire, the former Yankee Gas system, and all of NSTAR Electric
and NSTAR Gas since they purchased those companies.
Cambridge has benefited by how the system is designed, he said. The City is served by a 4kw
system for residential areas, overhead, which is meant to carry 4,000vlt of electricity that can be
scaled down for household usage. We bring power wherever it’s needed. The backbone of the
major arterial roots are underground. We have critical infrastructure protection systems to protect
grid, including substations, though public knowledge is limited due to security concerns.
Back in 2000, we brought in 150kw lines. Prior to that we owned Kendall Station, a fuel and
steam production plant. Lines brought steam across the river to Mass General Hospital, but the
plant was designed to bring power to East Cambridge. The boutique power company cost a lot of
money. Once East Cambridge came onto the grid, energy costs plummeted. The Cambridge
system also needed redundancy for its electric grid, which it gained after the switch. Thee is a
SCATA system to remotely control this region and monitor and control various systems.
Mr. Zamparelli went on to say that whenever we have a storm we can shut down areas, even a
very local area, such as during the Cambridge fire of December 3, 2016.
Mr. Durbin asked whether any other public official was granted permission to shut down the
power system other than the Fire Chief.
Mr. Zamparelli responded the Fire Chief is the only person that can cut power for a local grid, no
one else, not the Police Chief, not the City Manager. Cutting power can endanger people on life
support, for example, so you need to know who needs emergency electricity. When they turn
power off, they bring it back surgically. You often don’t think about electricity until you don’t
have it and that can be a problem.

heating needs is used. The temperate weather means that energy costs are very low right now,
putting coal and oil generation at a disadvantage. Buying whatever gas was left on the spot
market makes production very inexpensive. A lot of customers aren’t aware of that. Weather has
a big factor on cost.

A Committee member asked about the pole system around Cambridge.

Page 78 of 101
Packet Pg. 129

Mr. Zamparelli agreed that many people complain about the expansion of poles and infrastructure
on poles, which handle everything from power to phones to new cell phone services. Some want
that infrastructure to go underground, but there are many problems to that as well and there is no
other way to move electricity other than by wires so if taller poles are needed, that is what will
happen. Servicing underground lines can be a much more time consuming process but they do
look pretty. He had done some work on undergrounding for the City of Somerville on Beacon St,
he said, though at the time he advised that it was not a good idea. They did the analysis, and the
engineering itself was expensive. The final cost was $6.2 million to homeowners to do just 1.25
miles. That included new transformers, manholes, conduits, but doesn’t include house drops that
need to be converted from overhead to underground. Non-electric wires would also have to be
done.
Ms. Harrison asked whether underground was less susceptible to damage from weather events.
Mr. Zamparelli answered that our systems are designed to withstand most weather and
conditions. Our systems can even run under water. One benefit from undergrounding is
aesthetics, but from troubleshooting it is not as easily. He said it was not practical in older cities
like Cambridge. In new developments it might be possible where they are building everything,
including roads, but you never know what you will find when you start digging here as there is
over 100 years of historic infrastructure underground.
Mr. Kelley asked whether the cost Mr. Zamparelli quoted for Beacon St had been only for
undergrounding, and what the associated costs might be.
He responded that whenever you open a hole, you have to go in and replace all gas lines as well.
MA line requires us to replace anything 6” or greater, so if we go in, we replace everything. In
Cambridge, a lot of people are concerned about gas leaks, and we regularly go in and replace all
gas infrastructure. Gas leaks are monitored via holes in the street. They recently replaced all
Level 3 leaks. For small joint leaks, these have been virtually eliminated. When some of our
systems were designed, we were using clay pipes, which means there can be a lot to replace. On
the electric side, we have to go through Pole and Conduit Commission. City Electrician Steve
Lenkauskas manages much of the city’s light and electric infrastructure, which includes its own
LED streetlights.
Ms. Dillard asked whether Cambridge’s resources make such protected and environmental
friendly systems possible.
Mr. Zamparelli responded in the affirmative, but also stressed Cambridge’s activism. The
business community is also responsible for a lot of this. Have recently installed large holding
tanks for storm water overflow. They can pump water into these holding tanks, and then pump the
tanks back into the river as the water recedes. With climate change issues, people argue we will
see sea level rise, but a lot is conjecture. Either way, he said, we are prepared.
Mr. Aidinoff said growing up in NYC, the power companies would frequently have to turn off
electricity in some neighborhood during the summer. He asked why that might be.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

2.2.c

Mr. Zamparelli said that the companies were trying to avoid brownouts, caused by
underestimating the load and need.
Mr. Aidinoff asked if they were necessary here.

Page 79 of 101
Packet Pg. 130

2.2.c

If you have a brownout, that is usually a capacity problem. That could be your transmission
system, or the generator. Private persons who have generators can send electricity back into the
system, so even when the company kills the power, it can still be live and dangerous for workers.
They are supposed to test for live power and generators are supposed to flip the master switch,
but it does not always happen.
Mr. Kelley asked if Eversource does any public outreach on generator issue.
Mr. Zamparelli said they do through Bill Stack who covers energy efficient stuff. They also have
number of safety people who train first responders such as police and fire personnel, and they
have a person that demonstrates the dangers of electricity. If poles come down on your car, for
example, don’t get out of your car so you don’t ground yourself and get electrocuted. Assume all
wires are live and deadly. Wires of copper can be very expensive. Eversource will de-energize a
system where they find problems. They are constantly altering the system, to include
requirements for clearance from equipment. If there is not consistent power, buildings may not be
usable.
What Cambridge has benefited from is it’s a small, tight, affluent community, and the stuff they
have done is very well thought-out and well developed. Constantly expanding and changing.
Mr. Wineman said he had heard a lot about improvement to the system. What are your biggest
concerns now, he asked.
Mr. Zamparelli responded that it depends on the areas. We can have storm issues in certain areas.
Everything that we install, we anticipate the day it will fail. Years ago, people were attacking sub
stations, shooting them up on the west coast. Everyone at Eversource has an assignment when a
storm comes through, and they are active. We have electricians, lineman, engineers, etc. They can
even bring crews in from other states through mutual aid agreements to combat problems but if
other places have similar problems resources can be tight and responses may take longer. Not one
really knows how long an outage will last. They bring back as many customers as fast as they
can, per DPU regulations, so a single customer who is out may wait a long time as more populous
affected areas are serviced first. But Cambridge has relatively limited outages.
Mr. Dmytryk said we’ve heard in the news in recent months that there may be problem with
hackers getting into grid. He asked if that was a concern here.
Mr. Zamparelli said Eversource has taken significant steps to avoid that, and protect ourselves
from outside interference. Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) process designed to protect
those systems.
So they don’t have people checking emails on that same systems, Mr. Dmytryk asked.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Zamparelli said that we could, but typically don’t. A lot of the brownout issues are resolved
here because many New England areas have the necessary capacity and improved network of
substations. Much of the infrastructure is remote controlled, making acute response possible, but
sometimes someone still needs to climb up a pole to throw the switch.

Mr. Zamparelli answered that, no, everything is separated. Special clearance is required, and
backup systems create further security.

Page 80 of 101
Packet Pg. 131

2.2.c

Mr. Zamperelli said they do have critical facility list, hospitals, police departments, etc. They
monitor those outages, and also have list of persons on life support systems for those that self
identify. All part of our ERP, we work collaboratively with all those systems. And CPD will do
wellness checks for them. They are notified when power is out, and back on, for these people.
Ms. Harrison returned to Mr. Zamparelli’s comments on Cambridge’s activism and resources.
When we think about resiliency, and ability to react, can he cite examples of business,
neighborhoods, and activists working together?
Mr. Zamparelli didn’t have any specific examples, though he said they are often working with the
people that are in the community. Many have different roles in the city. We work with everyone,
he said, businesses, colleges, leaders, chambers, etc. Business people can be change angents.
Ms. Dillard asked if he saw many working relationships with other communities, such as
Somerville, etc.
Mr. Zamparelli said that’s exactly what he does, he works with many communities.
Mr. Kelley asked whether Cambridge work with other communities on these type of issues.
Mr. Zamparelli responded that he was sure they do. We certainly work with Boston’s climate
projection plans. You’d have to talk to individuals in the departments. In some ways communities
are competitive in the ways they try to attract and retain businesses though they are also
collaborative on some issues and City staff may from position to position in the region. The size
of local associations differ, as do their agendas. He holds an annual meeting an Emergency
Response Plans to ensure Eversource has appropriate contacts with towns and vice versa, to set
up relationships before events so he can triage issues. Relationships built during the normal
course of operations are crucial in figuring out how to handle specific issues.
Mr. Seidel asked if Eversource own all the equipment it uses around the City.
Mr. Zamparelli said no. For example, primary metered customers own their equipment. In
Cambridge, if is under 300 kba requirements, we don’t, they would be responsible for owning.
Mr. Seidel asked if it’s in a private building, who would do work on it.
Mr. Zamparelli said we would still go in and give specs, build out equipment. In Cambridge we
have many wet labs which are very energy intensive. If they chose to be a primary customer, they
would have control over their own systems though Eversource will build out the equipment to
meet the customers’ needs, who then decides what level of responsibility they want to give to
Eversource. Eversource is self-insured. Customers pay for specific changes that rate payers do not
pay for. Telephone poles are owned by either Eversource or Verizon and the owner is responsible
for managing them.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Dillard asked if Eversource prioritized returning power to vulnerable communities after an
outage, instead of only considering the largest number of people that can be serviced.

Ms. Kubik and Mr. Seidel said one of the thing we try to look at in this community is people
getting isolated during these events. So how do we keep people from feeling panicked?
Particularly for people that have lost electronic communication, how can people find out what the
larger process is and there place in it?

Page 81 of 101
Packet Pg. 132

2.2.c

If you’re a customer and you have an outage, there is little we can do to connect with you. If it’s a
trouble related outage, you call police or fire that can reach us immediately. We even respond to
social media, emails, outage maps, etc. Don’t typically post outage maps for security reasons. But
will let people know about scheduled (emergency) outages, which usually happen between
midnight and 5 AM because do work on the system later can impact traffic signals. The monitor
their life support customers constantly.
Mr. Aidinoff asked which source for the weather do they base their operations on.
Mr. Zamparelli said they have their own internal weather expert to give us best information. They
have weather conference calls to find out what happens and monitor the weather every three
hours. High winds are worse than snow. Usually trees do the most damage and they preposition
response crews as needed and it’s rare that all three states get hit at once so shifting resources
around is fairly common. Power is usually or off, but equipment does fail.
Mr. Seidel asked who powers the T?
Mr. Zamparelli said the T has some of their own power substations, for the GLX, we were able to
isolate a specific substation for that use. We are always involved in MBTA, involved now in the
expansion of Union Square.
Mr. Kelley asked when we see storm related flooding, do we worry about short circuiting?
If we get something like 3ft there may be problems, Mr. Zamparelli said. Their stations can
operate under water, but they are not designed that way. If it’s totally underwater, I’d have to
consult with our engineers as to the effect. All manholes have transformers that need to be
pumped out, though they can work underwater.
Mr. Kelley thanked Mr. Zamparelli for his time.
He said at some point we stop meeting with people, and just look inward. He asked if it was okay
to have ISD at the next meeting.
Mr. Kelley adjourned the meeting at 8:27 p.m.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Zamparelli said we have a single source contact phone that people can use. If you have any
problem you call that. If you can’t call, you call police department. CPD knows what is going on.
In Somerville, they have 311 system. Eversource can also call out to every customer in the
system. We can reverse call people to let them know that there will be a scheduled outage.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Members present:

Mark Aidinoff; Sonia Andujar; Gary Dmytryk; Emily Harrison; Craig
Kelley, Chair; Gail Kubik; and Steve Wineman.

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Guest Speaker:

Ranjit Singanayagam, Commissioner of Inspectional Services; Sisia
Daglian, Assistant Commissioner of Inspectional Services; Anthony
Tuccinardi, Manager of Operations at ISD; David Byrne, Senior
Building Inspector ISD.

Members of the Public: Stephen Nutter; Quinton Zondervan, two other members of public

Mr. Kelley called the meeting to order at 6:30. He mentioned a program being run by the Red
Cross of Massachusetts to install free smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors in Cambridge
on April 6, May 20, and June 3 from 9:00 a.m. through 3:00 p.m.
He introduced the day’s guest speakers from Inspectional Services Department (ISD). Mr. Kelley
said ISD somewhat of a weird department in that it does many things that you may not
association together. Tasks that fall under their umbrella include to inspect buildings, rodent
control, and health code compliance. He described the work of the Committee. They are getting
toward end of year long process, he said, and asked all the members to introduce themselves.
Mr. Sanganayagam introduced the members of his department, and explained the various districts
that split up the City for inspections. He described the various responsibilities broadly falling
under the following categories: building inspections, mechanical inspections, housing inspections,
and food and sanitary inspections.
Mr. Sanganayagam and Ms. Daglian gave a presentation (attached), and the following were
conversations sparked by the content.
He gave an example of how ISD might be mobilized outside of those set tasks, to include
hurricane relief preparedness. In such event, ISD representatives will be dispatched to highlight
safety problems ahead of hurricanes, secure objects, caution members of the public on loose
objects, hazards, etc.
Mr. Kelley asked if after a disaster event, whether ISD or CFD could close a building.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded that both departments could make such a decision, but we was
mainly talking about services ISD would provide before a hurricane to help prepare the
community. He also said that ISD can be called on to help in other emergency preparedness
situations, such as flooding of buildings.

March 28, 2017—795 Mass Ave, City Hall, Ackerman Room: 6:30 P.M.

Mr. Aidinoff asked if Mr. Sanganayagam could give sense for how quickly Cambridge’s sewers
could become overwhelmed during a flooding event, and how bad the backed up might be.

Page 83 of 101
Packet Pg. 134

2.2.c

Mr. Sanganayagam said that the Department of Public Works could provide better information,
but it can happen quickly, and indeed be bad for residents and businesses.

Mr. Sanganayagam said they work with and help more residential property, and that commercial
properties can contract someone to provide inspections, but the department can do both. Food
inspectors will often go into commercial establishments after a power failure, but otherwise the
inspectors would provide residential services first.
Mr. Kelley asked if his basement were flooded, why would he ask ISD to come inspect if there
was a potential they would them him the house was no longer inhabitable.
Mr. Sanganayagam said ISD inspectors still dispensed valuable advice on mold threats and other
hazards, but they would not go in unless invited. If there is no water or electricity access in a
structure, that space is no longer inhabitable, and they might go in. He said that ISD inspectors
can also help resident access services quicker, such as mold remediation services to owner or
landlords.
Ms. Kubik asked if ISD held meetings periodically to educate public on these services.
Mr. Sanganayagam said they do educate the public at certain meetings throughout the year, and
make sure that inspectors give out information during certification and any other regular
interactions.
He talked about other programs as well.
Mr. Kelley said that one of the good things about these monthly meetings is that certain topics
start to blend together. When HRI was here, they talked about sprinklers going off, the damage
that could cause, and remediation efforts.
Mr. Kelly asked if the lab safety committee also fell under the ISD.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded negatively, that is was under the Cambridge Health Alliance.
Mr. Kelley asked if ISD had inspectors on the clock 24/7.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded that inspectors are on call 24/7, but not necessarily on the clock.
The Cambridge Fire Department calls us for our help as necessary.
Ms. Andujar said that she has seen dwellings where the fire extinguishers seem to be missing,
how asked how enforcement works in city dwellings.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded that they can only make recommendations in most cases. Unless
the owner is doing renovations, inspectors can’t go in uninvited and force anyone to adopt safety
standards.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Ms. Harrison asked if the inspectional process was the same in the aftermath of a flooding
disaster whether the property was residential, commercial, or retail.

Mr. Kelley asked about preparing housing and buildings for future heat impacts. He recounted
reports from parents at the former King Open School on Cambridge St. that classrooms became
so hot that the children’s medicine would start to loose potency.

Page 84 of 101
Packet Pg. 135

Ms. Daglian said that most people know if you have robust building envelop, the temperature
inside the building will be more stable. Robust, meaning adequate climate appropriate insulation.
She said they would like to see building codes evolve more quickly. For city buildings, it is
possible to require more stringent standards to mitigate some of the heat problems. It would be
very effective to enforce energy code compliance during the construction phase. If thermal
bridging were required, they would like their inspectors to be able to collect that information.
Mr. Kelley noted that many building codes were set by the state, and asked how much the city do
on its own.
Mr. Sanganayagam said the City could introduce some zoning changes, or incentives. For green
building, we can recreate setback incentives. You can project into setbacks for added insulation,
for example.
Mr. Aidinoff turned the conversation to MIT, saying that there have there been efforts, but in the
absence of enforcement powers, how could one embarrass the university to come into
compliance.
In response to infrared photos of thermal loss, Ms. Harrison stated that this looks like very
effective public service, but asked if there had been any larger outreach or citywide heat mapping.
Has ISD done anything to show residents their problem areas through infrared technology like
this, she asked.
Ms. Daglian said they have not done anything like that, but it’s an interesting idea.
Mr. Kelley said it seems like you could take as many pictures as you want, but that won’t amount
to much if you can’t enforce.
Ms. Harrison asked how resistant to changing residents would be when they know the extent of
thermal loss, for example.
Mr. Byrne said it’s all about money. If there is money to make improvements during a project, the
developers may. But contractors are trying to get a project in under budget. The majority of
design elements come down to the minimum cost associated with construction.
Mr. Wineman said there may have been a thermal study done in 2012 on Cambridge homes, but
its obscurity speaks to its effectiveness in raising public awareness.
Mr. Dmytryk asked how ISD inspects buildings with so much construction going on at a single
project, and across the City. He lives in a fairly new building, he said, and the structure has about
$2m in repairs and updating necessary, from electrical, to sprinkler, and balcony issues. These are
all issues that ISD inspect, but issues were not caught, and the developer was about to get away
with not making updates. The project contractor said that this was epidemic, that there are new
buildings in Cambridge that require over $1m to bring things up to code.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

2.2.c

Mr. Byrnes said that he had not heard of problems with construction in the City to that extent.
They go out and inspect electrical, plumbing, etc., but the brunt of the responsibility falls on the
designers. They have to stamp compliance with all relevant codes when they submit their plans.
Our agency could not catch all those issues without living there, he said. But still, concrete testing

Page 85 of 101
Packet Pg. 136

2.2.c

is done by designers. ISD will find problems after a project is done, but can only inspect what
they see.

Mr. Byrnes responded in the affirmative, which is why it’s important to make sure the job was
done right before certificates are signed.
Mr. Sanganayagam stated that when a single family or two family is built, ISD will inspect the
property thoroughly. When it’s a 40 unit building, it’s difficult to give the same level of
inspection. That’s why the architect must sign an affidavit stating that work was done properly.
Mr. Kelley said that he always thought ISD was the warranty of good construction, but with so
much building going on, it’s impossible to inspect everything.
Mr. Dmytryk continued that if what they’ve seen in his building was representative,, there is a
pandemic problem of poor construction that does not meet code.
Mr. Kelley said that it is important to keep future residents aware of the statute of limitations for
challenging affidavits and certifications claiming work was done properly.
Mr. Kelley turned the conversation to urban agriculture. He asked what current animals and crops
are being considered.
Mr. Sanganayagam stated that right now, it’s mostly chicken and bees.
Commenting on a slide discussing Melbourne’s (Australia) agriculture plan, Mr. Wineman asked
how long the Melbourne plan would feed the city if the food distribution system where disrupted.
Ms. Daglian said she was not sure, and that it is hard to plan for that level of disruption.
Mr. Kelley said from a zoning perspective, if a homeowner removed a paved surface to make a
driveway into a garden, could they convert it back into a paved surface later. If they want to get a
driveway again, are there any problems to that, he asked. It was something to think about for the
committee. People are unwilling to give up things that they can’t get back, he said, and that
makes it harder for people to take that plunge.
Mr. Sanganayagam pointed out that a resident can remove paving and still park there.
Ms. Kubik asked if the City produced green street maps, info on street trees, etc.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded that he was fairly sure CDD and DPW do have that information.
Mr. Kelley asked they wanted to talk about green roofs, does ISD get involved.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded affirmatively. This is an issue that zoning allows us to address, he
said. For example, if you are capped at 3 floors, you create incentives to have a green roof to
make a 4th floor.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Dmytryk asked if these certificates are signed before occupancy permits are given.

Mr. Dmytryk said the primary advantage of a green roof is to capture and slow storm water.

Page 86 of 101
Packet Pg. 137

2.2.c

Mr. Sanganayagam responded that local zoning codes can have a major difference. The energy
stretch code, for example, raises standards for insulation and air tightness, etc.
Mr Byrne added that with stretch code, it was 20 percent higher than what was required at state
level. A municipality cannot write building code, only the state. If there were going to be
changes, it would have to come through zoning. With the stretch code, MA gave option for
localities to adopt stricter standards.
Ms. Kubik asked if a state code fails in certain aspects, can the city work through zoning to
address the gaps?
Mr. Sanganayagam said only where allowed.
Ms. Kubik stated that in NYC a building code appendix was passed to make improvements to
buildings that are more flood prone. The only people that truly have authority to push for changes
is the city.
Mr. Kelley said that such changes would have to come through home rule in Massachusetts.
Mr. Sanganayagam said not always. There are other ways to affect change. CDD is working with
state to encourage best practices, he said.
Mr. Dmytryk said that in Alewife, there are concerns about building in a wetland, so perhaps we
need more stringent codes. There is a lot of opposition to tall buildings for example, but to
capture CO2 and water, we probably need higher buildings with a smaller ground-floor footprint.
Mr. Kelley asked where responsibility lies for managing stuff. A builder may come to ISD to do
inspections, and different departments for various other needs.
Mr. Sanganayagam said that the building code also has flood mitigation prevention
implementations. Certain buildings they must apply to the EPA standards.
Mr Byrne said one has to bring amendments through the state. Cities and towns can only adopt
what the state gives us.
Mr. Kelley said he wanted to explore the rodent control part, because that comes up a lot. When
he says rodents, he means rats.
Mr. Sanganayagam stated that every dumpster in the city must be permitted. They must be rodent
proofed, and inspected every year.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Aidinoff that the Committee had heard in a number of presentations from City agencies that
it’s sometimes much easier to be in Cambridge. And in some regards, it’s the same everywhere
else. It seems that most issues here come down to state code, is there a local element that’s
missing, he asked?

Mr. Kelley asked what other requirements are in place, because DPW and other departments were
involved in recent control efforts.
Mr. Sanganayagam said ISD also licenses the haulers, so we have their information as well.

Page 87 of 101
Packet Pg. 138

2.2.c

Ms. Harrison asked about trash cans that might have more volume than dumpsters, but are not
regulated the same way.

Ms. Harrison said that it was well know that their building had a huge rat problem, but they did
not know how to address, as residents of Harvard, or as residents of Cambridge.
Mr. Kelley asked if ISD inspectors can go on to Harvard property to say that their trash cans are
not in compliance.
Mr. Sanganayagam responded in the affirmative, if that is causing a problem we can address it, he
added.
Mr. Kelley stated that it seemed confusing that Harvard’s dumpsters have to be licensed, and their
waste hauler has to be licensed, but the 25 bins that they put out every night don’t have to be
licensed.
Mr. Sanganayagam said that was technically correct, but if there is a rodent problem, or defects in
the barrels, we can enforce regulations to get extermination and make the University replace the
barrels.
Mr. Byrne said they often go to a complaint area, see what the issue is, and take a two block stroll
around the complaint area to look at the restaurants, houses, gardens, etc., and look for potential
contributors.
Mr. Kelley added that that may include rodent burrows. Mr. Tuccinardi may show up and find a
problem on your property and suddenly you have a problem, he said.
Mr. Tuccinardi responded that they mainly go after the food source, and bait for rats. When the
King Open School was demolished, they did over 900 inspections, and would not issue
demolition permits without a rodent report.
Ms. Harrison asked if a Zika outbreak hit the city, would there be a different inspection process,
or would ISD rely on existing protocol.
Mr. Sanganayagam said they would probably follow existing protocol for equine encephalitis, but
they would first and foremost rely on guidance from CHA.
Mr. Kelley asked if we wanted to look at 15 issues to address through inspections from a
resiliency standpoint, could you say whether it can be addressed, or how it might be implemented,
or something like that.
Mr. Sanganayagam said they could look into it.
Mr. Wineman put a question forth to the committee. He said that there is often tension between
an orientation to enforcement standards and building mutual reliance on each other. He asked
how the two might be rectified. If all complaints go to the City, he asked, then how do we build
better neighborhoods.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Tuccinardi said that they can still enforce if there is a problem.

Page 88 of 101
Packet Pg. 139

2.2.c

Ms. Daglian said that they like to get information out to the public so they can work on issues
themselves. They prioritize educate on various issues at community meetings, and this brings
community members together to work on communal problems.

Ms. Harrison asked how a department changes quickly enough to address new problems.
Mr. Sanganayagam said that state codes are broadly defined, and require local interpretation and
enforcement.
Mr. Tuccinardi said effective tools were local information and outreach. With the December fire,
we mobilized right away, he said. Rodent control was one of the first thing ISD did after the fire
was addressed.
Mr. Sanganayagam said that if there is ever a complaint, please call us.
Mr. Kelley thanked them for their time and turn the conversation to Committee business. He
asked for a motion to accept minutes from January, and they were adopted.
Mr. Kelley said the idea is to complete work in June, but perhaps we need to take a break in July
and August and complete in September.
Mr. Wineman said he thought they should start as soon as possible.
Mr. Kelley said that the school department is the last big group to talk with but they can do that at
luncheon.
Ms. Holloway said the resiliency report from other city sent around by Ms. Dillard seems like a
great place to start. Why not begin, she asked. They could begin by testing the city on that
report’s resiliency index. She thought it would be good required reading prior to writing the
report.
Mr. Kelley said sure, they don’t want to reinvent the wheel.
Mr. Wineman said they should not lock themselves into not talking to any other human being, but
they need to move into next phase. They need to start writing. They can break into small groups,
have luncheons, and move bits along.
Mr. Kelley asked if people are willing to delegate picking the dates to him and Mr. Durbin to find
public meetings for the group. One of the great ideas is to have a photo contest, and perhaps they
should do that again.
Mr. Durbin said that they would first need to have a clear goal and ask for participants.
Mr. Aidinoff said that DPW recently took pictures of people with hats when it was hot out. A lot
of people talked about it. They need a hook to capture attention, he said.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

A member quipped that it is still an effective policy to enforce “Clean it or lien it.”

Mr. Kelley asked if they should just put a stake in the whole idea.
Mr. Wineman said he didn’t want to use Committee time for this.

Mr. Dmytryk asked what the group process would be for drafting. Is the plan that Craig and Wil
write it all and the Committee is asked to review, he asked, or do they all work together, review
notes, etc.
Mr. Durbin stated that if the Committee wanted to have some longevity, it needed to be robust
enough to operate regardless of the November 2017 election results, and besides, he added, he
would have a newborn the next time this Committee met.
Mr. Kelley said that come had come in with the agreement that they would not be asked for more
time commitments than Tuesday nights. So if members are willing, he and Mr. Durbin can use
their time.
Ms. Holloway said that she imagined facilitating a session where members present on topics, put
ideas on flip charts, and write the 5-6 most meaningful ideas and presentations. At least it would
give a framework for moving forward, she said.
Mr. Wineman said his biggest concern is not what the report will be—there will be sticky points
and such—but there is a lot of common ground around this table about what resiliency looks like
and needs to look like. His biggest concern is that they do what most committees do, which is
write and nothing happens, they all leave. That is how the system works. He would love to see
them involved in the implementation phase. There may be things them could do themselves to get
the ball rolling on major issues. He can see them next year organizing neighborhood meetings. He
would like to see them entertain the implementation role.
Ms. Andujar agreed. As a low-income tenant in the community, she sees a lot of isolation and
mistrust. She tries to reach out to her neighbors for everything. Building that cohesion is tough,
even at this table they do not come from the same neighborhoods.
Mr. Kubik volunteered her graphic designing skills to the final project.
Mr. Durbin reminded the Committee about an upcoming meeting with Northeastern University
Ph.D. candidate Courtney Page.
Mr. Kelley adjourned the meeting.

Ms. Harrison said the group could have a middle school project that asks students to collect data,
then they go out and interview neighbors (spreading awareness), and then give information back.
They could even invite students to present their work.

Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency
(notes taken by Craig Kelley who often did not record the speaker but did report what was said).
Specific risks include food security, water resources, heat and climate relief, trees. Did we miss
things? We also don’t want to duplicate what other people are doing via the Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment.
How do we define risk?

Communication is critical, that could be both a topic and multiple sub-topics.
Taking territoriality and egos out of issues is important. CPD and CFD seem to model that. We
would like to see that sort of communication across the board.
How might neighborhoods develop that level of inter-neighborhood communication?
“As a step towards….” is good language to use in trying to set goals.
We might want to use the risks we listed on our stickies and the white papers as examples for
problem solving.
And we need to make sure our great ideas, while globally great, have a Cambridge-specific
aspect.
Not all neighborhoods are the same. Maybe this resiliency building effort is about building
community within neighborhoods.
There is some concern that maybe city services are not that well-connected with each other or
with neighborhoods even if City staff think they have it “covered.”
Mr. King noted that bandwidth is an issue. If communications break down and people get
overwhelmed, what’s the back up? We need bigger/better hardware. It’s a big issue because
communications are key if troublesome things happen simultaneously.
Mr. Seidel said that the Committee was formed somewhat on the model that this resiliency
building effort is not top-down, central command stuff. It’s been flipped on its head. So- how
does that moment when City and Citizens intersect happen and is what we have now what we
want in the future?
Through the lens of social cohesion, all else is addressed. Which may be why some specifics such
as rats did not come up when we all listed our issues and thoughts on stickies on the wall.
It’s tough to be omniscient enough to rank specific issues and agencies, so Ms.Harrison went for
cross-cutting issues.
Mr. Seidel noted that we’re looking for new tools. And with a different world coming our way,
being more cohesive at a local level will help us better handle new stresses.

So- social cohesion is our end state, but how do we make that happen? We only had Courtney
talk about that. Eight months ago, it wasn’t even something we brought up to further explore
when we kicked subjects around. And if we, with our focus, missed it, what about everybody
else?
Mr. Seidel noted that intentionality is important. So what is the question we are answering with
this report?
A focusing goal for the report could help us train our minds to think about it.
Ms. Kubik said she wrote more about actions and suggestions rather than observations about
problems so for her, it’s more about getting various people in the community to do stuff. Maybe
make suggestions about how the City can move that along.
Mr. Wineman asked what steps could the City take to be neighborhood resilient in terms of
social cohesion and effective communication. We can’t make people communicate but we can
make it easier for them to communicate.
Libraries as community centers. You can put structures in place to make that happen easier.
Mr. Seidel noted that we need to benchmark against things that are already going on, such as
the North Cambridge Family Opera or Somerville’s Porchfest.
Mr. Kelley asked how does social cohesion get built out of this?
Mr. Wineman asked that given what’s already in place, how do we build on it? We don’t have to
answer the question, we just have to ask it.
Be we do have to say what’s already in place, as well as where do we seem to fall short?
We do not want too much writing in our report about our presenters but could maybe put more
information in the appendix.
We heard from all sorts of professionals. But we still have the “know your neighbor” issue.
“Do you have at least one person you can talk to about problems?” is a variation of the question
we’ve been asking.
Any neighborhood is constantly changing. How do you work with them to help them be
resilient?
Maybe ask people, “Would you reach out? Do you feel reached out to?”
There are all sorts of different subcultures that can give people a sense of belonging.
Urban planning at the City level transcends neighborhoods.
Are you a provider or a receiver of services? We are all both.
But the City is generally just a provider.
A 25 year old could help me who could help an 80 year old person.
The City also relies on people to do certain things

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

2.2.c

Page 92 of 101
Packet Pg. 143

The City could say we want to take the initiate to build more resilient neighborhoods, but you
need to be on board to make that happen. The City can’t just say so and it’s done.
The City does not necessarily have it all “covered.”
What is it that the City could do to get us up to knowing 15 neighbors apiece?
Maybe something like a neighborhood week at local restaurants could help build those
connections.
What has sticking power?
DPW threw cookouts during the Western Avenue project and set up committee of neighbors to
help smooth things out. That was an avenue of connections in its own way.
Having/doing something “often enough” to have an impact is important.
And does this stuff have sticking power? What happens when the little old lady at the hub of
communications dies, the Western Ave project is done and so forth? Did the previous efforts
truly build lasting social cohesion or do they stop without this driving force?
Do the people in the Western Ave neighborhood consider the communications efforts a
success? Some do, some don’t.
Mr Wineman noted that shifting group of neighbors at monthly meals he attends is way better
than nothing but it is not the end all. He would like this conversation to continue postCommittee.
People intersect at different places and different points of interests.

Minutes of the Mayor’s Special Advisory Committee on Neighborhood-Based Resiliency

Members present:

Suni Dillard; Gary Dmytryk; Julia Holloway; Craig Kelley, Chair;
Ethridge King, Vice-Chair; Gail Kubik; Sam Seidel; Steve Wineman.

Committee staff:

Wilford Durbin, Executive Assistant to the Committee

Mr. Kelley thanked everyone for attending, and said that he had planned on making a Powerpoint
presentation to the group, but they are not very effective. He said the Committee should be
discussing what their final project should look like, and have an idea by the end of June.
He stated that he thought of the project as starting with the individual, then broadening to the
household, the neighborhood, and then the city. Above that were NGOs, businesses, the state, and
federal agencies. The Committee has not had state or federal reps in the meetings, but he said he
has talked with many local representatives, Lesley University, MIT, Harvard University, the
Cambridge Innovation Center, etc.
As an offshoot of this effort, he said he’d been going to a lot of conferences, on Urban Resiliency
in NYC, meetings in St. Paul, MN, etc. In reading all his notes, he would pull out sections that
seem relevant even if the Committee didn’t necessarily talk about it in here.
He stated that he wanted to make sure people felt comfortable with that approach. He invited
members to incorporate those discussions and talking points that they’d like to include.
Ms. Dillard said the Committee had never really talked about the City’s other committees, such as
Planning Committees, NetZero, Envision Cambridge, and Climate Vulnerability. She suggested
that they may want to reach out to them.
Mr. Kelley said that’s something they can do, and there is a lot of other work and discussions.
The City has the Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment that will turn into a Climate Change
Adaptation program. He stated that they need to acknowledge the other things the city is doing,
and that they are not the only ones talking about resiliency. Certainly, NetZero is doing the same,
he said.
Ms. Dillard said that it was discussed about the Committee being the bridge between the many
different groups.
Mr. Wineman stated he had a thought inspired by the Envision Cambridge process. One of their
categories is resiliency and adaptation, which was really striking to see. Leaving sustainability
aside, he stated it was really striking to see resiliency broken out as a distinct category. He was
already concerned that what the Committee was doing would be seen as too niche, whereas they
should strive to be more pervasive. Resiliency is over-arching, he said, and should be a part of
housing, transportation, education, and public works. Everything the city does should be
measured by how it contributes or takes away from resilience. We could advocate for that to be
the case.

2.2.c

Mr. Seidel stated that the Committee had previously talked about a measuring stick for resilience,
and asked if they could come up with one or recommend one for the City to use.
Mr. Kelley acknowledged that it was discussed, but they had never come up with one. He said
their efforts should fall into what Mr. Wineman said about needing to be pervasive. The Envision
process seems to be overly concerned with flooding and heat, he said, but the City’s approach
needs to be more sophisticated.
Ms. Kubik said that Jonathan Rose is looking at resilience on a block-by-block basis in NYC. Via
Verde in Harlem and Sedino Verde as well. Resiliency efforts were focused on rebuilding Red
Hook after Hurricane Sandy. The question is how to translate those resiliency efforts to the
density of Cambridge.
Ms. Holloway said that they could have invited other organization to measure Cambridge.
Mr. Kelley said that Northeastern University has a survey that they could offer us. That would be
one yardstick, and he said it would be an interesting thing to do.
Mr. Seidel asked if the Committee should recommend need next steps.
Mr. Kelley said that the Committee will have to create suggestions, yes. One possibility is that
they begin a process to secure special authority from state to create special flood planning overlay
district, he said. Other suggestions such as different parking requirements would be interesting.
Ms. Holloway said that the Committee could focus on creating water bottle filling stations around
the city, and other low hanging fruit.
Mr. Kelley said that he needed to parse out the best 10 things to encourage resiliency, and then
give next steps. The City would like to go to the state to ask for a home rule petition for different
resiliency zoning, he said. He asked if the members had any other thoughts. He said he was
hoping to leave here with an okay to jump forward, then by the end of June members can give
approval.
Mr. Dmytryk said he liked the idea of scaling up resiliency from individual to community.
Mr. Seidel said he has no objection to including comments that were discussed at conventions,
but not necessarily here.
Mr. Kelley gave an example from a recent Environmental Business meeting. He stated that they
discussed how to create resilient grids. Cambridge is talking about a micro-grid, and one of the
discussions going forward is that Cambridge needs guidance on how those resources need to be
used. He stated that gasoline and food may be important provide, but there are no rules on who
could buy gasoline and who could by food when a state of emergency is declared. That has
become a sticking point for other people when discussing islanding, he said, and people are
concerned that residents of other communities may come in to buy up the resources the City
provides in a hypothetical emergency.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Kelley said that a common thought at the conferences is every decision needs to be passed
through the lens of how resiliency fits into it. There is this strong thought that you can’t stick
resiliency into just flooding, he said, but rather it’s about racial equality and justice, and housing
equity.

Page 95 of 101
Packet Pg. 146

Ms. Kubik said that a community in Connecticut has the only successful example of a micro-grid
and that is not up and running yet. Buying into the micro-grid is a major concern when the utility
company won’t buy in, she said, and recommended that people read Jonathan Rose’s book which
discusses micro-communities in NYC that would have power, water, hospitals, etc. She
recommended that members focus on the block scale. When Sandy came through, there were
communities cut off, people couldn’t get medicine and food. When those areas were rebuilt, they
used some of Rose’s ideas she said. She recommend that members look into NICHA.
Mr. Wineman said that because NYC is so dense it would be difficult to translate solutions there
into something useful for Cambridge. He asked if Rose talked about that.
Ms. Kubik said perhaps he’s still working it out.
Mr. Kelley said a major take away in many resiliency discussion is the need for density. All the
discussed benefits occur only after a certain density. He gave another example of using youth
centers as shelters with services during an emergency, but a generator for that use is only rated for
so much power and it consumes so much gasoline. It requires fuel, and that supply might be
challenged.
He said that during a conversation in NYC, he heard that wherever residents were during Sandy,
they were told the City can’t get to them under a certain amount of time.
Ms. Kubik said that these systems fail, generators don’t work, and if the gas trucks can’t even get
into the city then that infrastructure is worthless.
Mr. Wineman said that our systems also need redundancy. If one use is removed because it
doesn’t work, what then he asked.
Mr. Kelley said that the underline assumption is that one needs to be prepared for 10 days of
break in service form the City.
Ms. Dillard said that there were interesting organizations called eco-districts that are thinking
about different power sources and how to engage with the community.
Mr. Kelley reiterated that he felt the city doesn’t necessarily have it all covered. If a generator is
only good for so much amount of time, then you no longer have a situation covered afterward.
Maybe they need to have worse conditions to learn the lesson he suggested.
Mr. Seidel said that was sort of where they started, back at the individual level. It’s as much a
mindset issue than anything else, he said. There are systems, and city issues, but in the end it
comes back to mindset. He stated that it’s as much how he approaches daily life and interactions,
that builds resiliency. What can I add in terms of resiliency in my life? The Committee started
with observations that there are a lot of people looking at the system issues, but perhaps that’s not
as true as they thought. Either way, he said, the daily interactions are predictors on what will
happen when stress is added to the system.

2.2.c

Mr. Kelley said that it sounded like he was talking about social cohesion.

Page 96 of 101
Packet Pg. 147

2.2.c

Ms. Holloway asked what a win would be out of the report. To her it’s some commitment to the
values therein, a sustained discussion on resiliency. It could be that Cambridge wants to be the
number one city of its size for resiliency, for example. It could be that the City sponsors more
block parties. She said that the city has so many resources, but not everyone knows how to access
them. They can be very silo-ed, she said. It would be a big win to build the multi-dimensional
aspects of resiliency.
Mr. Seidel asked where one parks such ideas. Mr. Kelley thought that maybe they didn’t get
parked anywhere. Ms. Holloway wondered if issues were embedded would anything get done.
Mr. Wineman offered two thoughts. One is that they sponsor more community meetings where
resiliency is just brought to the neighborhoods as an issue, even if just to start a conversation. A
whole conversation needs to happen, he said. He said he wondered if the Committee should
recommend a chief resiliency officer to facilitate operating at all these different levels. That
person would need to be bringing it to the community level, he said.
Mr. Kelley said that get people involved was a common thread at conferences, but no one knows
how to do it. Some people give food, other offer childcare at events. He asked what happens
when the grant money runs out. The Committee should at least be able to identify the gaps, even
if they can’t fill them.
Mr. Wineman said that when the resiliency people we here, they recommended a solar powered
generator for cell phones, but he couldn’t find one to purchase.
Mr. Kelley said that the City sells rail barrels, and could do something similar with solar charges
and other things we want people to have access to.. Perhaps the city could help vet best brands, he
said. He asked if there was a way for the city to buy blocks of these things and then distribute to
residents.
Ms. Holloway asked if the Committee had discussed the “wins” as brought up in the last meeting.
Mr. Kelley asked her to define a win.
Ms. Holloway stated that she was thinking that if they draft something, they should consider what
the filters are. If they pick half a dozen audiences, she asked if it is a win if they read the whole
report.
Mr. Kelley stated that he thinks it’s a win if you can talk to your friends at the dinner table about
resiliency and be comfortable with it. He stated that he would like to have a report that people
outside of government can look at and get 1-3 things out of it to support daily things.
Mr. Wineman stated that he was more ambitious, and that the Committee should come up with
more concrete deliverables that resources may be devoted to programs that get implemented and
information is accessible to and used by people.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Wineman said that the next question in coming up with useful recommendations, and what
are the strategies for forming those relationships. The city can tell people to make better relations,
he said, but what are the actual mechanisms, the interventions to make that happen.

Ms. Holloway said that the Committee could have a pamphlet be one of the deliverables. Then
one of the future recommendations could be how to publicize the information.

Page 97 of 101
Packet Pg. 148

2.2.c

Ms. Holloway asked if it was indeed a goal to be thought of as leaders in the country on this
topic.
Mr. Kelley said yes, he has this idea that we will be thought leaders in resiliency.
Mr. Wineman said that he has a strong reaction to that, and it reminded him of the Georgetown
Prize. He asked what the difference was if we win it versus someone else. He would like to see a
more collaborative process on this. It would be good if the City was great on this, but equally
good if they learn from other communities and they from us. If they are the only ones to weather
certain situations, what is the good in that he asked.
Ms. Holloway said that there are so many conversations to engage with, but in order to make this
project survive, they needed to figure out what to do with this collective knowledge. What are
best practices? How can you get people to do things?
Mr. Kelley said that at the conferences he’d been to the problem is truly existential. Communities
need transformational change, and he was trying to figure out how Cambridge can be the city that
figured out transformational change.
Ms. Holloway said that was the opening paragraph of the report. The world is spinning faster and
faster and there is frequently more anxiety, but she wanted to know what happens when
transformational change occurs.
Mr. Kelley said the thing that was challenging to everyone is how to include as many voices as
possible in the conversation. Getting people to show up to share their stories on resiliency is a
challenge, he said.
Mr. Wineman asked what members thought about recommending a chief resiliency officer.
Ms. Dillard asked how their recommendations translate into action.
Mr. Wineman said that if they make this as a recommendation, it would be a key
recommendation, and they should flesh out what exactly it means. For their recommendations to
be adopted on the ground, instead of just as a niche suggestion, they need to define goals clearly
he said.
Ms. Kubik said 100 Resilient Cities aims at achieving this, but their programs are funded through
grants. Once the grant money is exhausted, these positions will go away.
Ms. Dillard said the Committee needed to consider an implementation plan.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel stated process is important. Three wins could be that the Committee direct somebody
to do something. It could also be a broader awareness of this thing we call resiliency. There is this
concept, he said, and there a lot there to unpack in resiliency. A third piece could be that even if
this isn’t the standard report, this could become part of the canon of the resiliency movement.

Mr. Seidel said there may be an interim step to hold a chief resiliency officer conference in six
months after the grant money is exhausted and to invite all these resiliency officers to come and
speak. He said the city could fund it.

Page 98 of 101
Packet Pg. 149

2.2.c

Ms. Holloway said a huge win could be just to impress how rich the discussion can be, and how
deep the discussion can go in each of the side pockets of conversation. What does a resilient
government look like.

Mr. Kelley said he imagines Harvard or MIT being interested as well.
Mr. Wineman stated that the devil is always in the detail. Consider if they make this
recommendation, and host the conference, then who is responsible for organizing the information
and moving things to the next step he asked.
Mr. Kelley said there needs to be money for such a thing. He said there are models where other
people have stumbled through this stuff before, but having someone that can tease out the
challenges would be useful, he said.
Ms. Holloway stated that when talking about a resilient government it may be necessary to lay the
bureaucratic stuff aside, and jump into projects.
Mr. Kelley said during the December fire in the Wellington-Harrington district, it appeared from
the outside like the city shut down all non-essential programs during the aftermath to deal with it.
Mr. Wineman said it might not have been the response but the process that tied people up. He
asked if the departments are talking with each other and what the level of confusion was. Having
a process to talk through issues is important.
Mr. Seidel said he thought the fire incident should be include in the report, and that there should
be a write up (perhaps a lengthy one) because this seemed to be the perfect case study. Maybe our
report suggests a formal followup.
Ms. Holloway stressed that they should still drill down on the tangibles in order to make it
accessible, look at a couple of examples through our specific lense.
Mr. Seidel said the Committee should still incorporate something on the fire, perhaps a whole
section.
Ms. Holloway said they could recommend the need for resilience volunteers, professionally
trained, to respond.
Mr. Kelley said that he had been accepted to be trained in vulnerability response, and also to help
cities identify vulnerabilities. He said some cities have resiliency ambassadors, but when the
money is gone, not he questioned how much good they do.
Ms. Holloway said programs need to have redundancy. She gave the example of how crossing
guards can be trained to do more.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel said a good readable report would be a good outcome.

Mr. Kelley agreed, and added that the City could empower librarians to do more, and even that
resiliency training is something they can park at the library.

Page 99 of 101
Packet Pg. 150

2.2.c

Mr. Wineman agreed to the training, but also building more into current processes. He said they
should not consider that they dealing with blank slates. There are a lot of resources built into the
neighborhood, and they need to help identify the resources.

Mr. Kelley said he had attended three NY State sponsored Disaster Response training, and during
those events they have the same slideshow, and give out bags with supplies, but they consider that
training. He didn’t think that went far enough.
Mr. Wineman said he wanted to reinforce the thought of a resilient city government, and said he
would love to see that as a heading in the report. He thought it was a great phrase.
Mr. Kelley stated that at some point this summer, they will have a public meeting. Harvard will
invite Steve Bannon to speak soon, he thought, and the City will need to talk to whoever has to be
involved in getting ahead of this thing, but he didn’t know who makes these efforts resilient.
Mr. Wineman agreed that being proactive is a key component to resiliency, as well as being able
to coordinate and communicate, and also to put egos aside.
Ms. Dillard said that the head of Middlebury had written an interesting response to the riots there
outlining what they will do from now on. The president’s response was to not act out as
individuals.
Ms. Holloway said that resiliency is a response to something that happens and the system as
constructed can’t respond to that event. The question is whether a community is able to bounce
back efficiently. There is also something to consider about whether the system as formulated may
work for the event that happen. She stated that it’s often the thing you didn’t plan for that sets you
back the most. The question becomes can the system transform or evolve and get to a better
place. It has to adapt in some way it doesn’t know it needs to, and that can be hard.
Mr. Seidel stated you cannot know the specifics of future stress, so it is about a mindset. If you
are pre-disposed to think about this issue in a certain way, you’re more likely to make better
choices. He stated that there was power with naming things, or knowing them, which should be
included in the report. He gave another observation, saying that one wants to know their
neighbors, but only to a certain point. This notion that one wants your neighbors to know you is
limited by a desire for privacy.
Ms. Holloway said naming and defining resiliency is also important.
Mr. Wineman recommended that lessons from Amanda Chen’s visit be included in the report.
Mr. Kelley said cities often regard resiliency in terms of heat islanding and flooding, but Ms.
Chen’s problem is kids that don’t have a safe home to go to, or enough food. The people she
deals with are outside of my daily life, he said, I can’t easily understand how they view resiliency.

Attachment: Resiliency Committee Minutes 2016-2017 (COF 2017 #36 : Neighborhood-Based Resiliency)

Mr. Seidel noted that we need to learn from each other.

Ms. Holloway asked if the Committee could develop examples of different kinds of resilience.
Aspects that others might not see as resiliency. Ms. Chen has this social justice program that
starts with diverting kids from jail, and then gets quite concrete to the terms of the program
providing actual support, etc. She was a great example of living resiliency, she said.

2.2.c

Ms. Dillard said it was important that their report doesn’t just include climate issues.

Ms. Holloway recommended that he give members an assignment, and they could all write
something.
Mr. Kelley said his assignment was to send in resources or stories that should be in the report,
then they can kick around what should be in the report. He said members should forward the
information by June 20, and that will give him enough guidance to draft something. The plan is to
use the summer to fill in the gaps.
Mr. Kelley asked for a motion to accept the minutes from last meeting.
The minutes were approved.
Mr. Kelley said they were done here tonight, and thanked them for their attendance.

City Council Discussion: Courthouse parking and traffic

Dear City Clerk Lopez,
It has come to my attention that the city council will be discussing the parking options for the Sullivan Courthouse project
at this evening’s meeting. I believe this project provides a great opportunity for the City to promote better transportation
options and provide a real benefit to the residents of East Cambridge.
As a longtime East Cambridge resident and home owner, I have seen a number of impressive changes sweep through
the neighborhood always with the glaring issues of traffic and parking. As you know, East Cambridge is a tight community
and parking and traffic are always a concern.
I have witnessed the significant increase in traffic along Third Street backing up from Cambridge Street all the way to
Binney Street and often times well beyond towards Kendall. It is currently a daily gridlock trying to make ones way from
Kendall. With the Volpe project in work with a projected 800 new commuters into the neighborhood (MIT’s Steve Marsh
estimate); I only imagine this congestion to grow worse without some mitigation by the City. The Sullivan courthouse
project’s proposed 420 additional spots will only exacerbate this problem
In addition to traffic, the other concern I see is taking away public parking spots to satisfy a developer’s requirement for
parking. These spots are used by the East Cambridge community and removing them provides no benefit to that
community. I have availed myself of the winter parking lot when the City asked that we do so to help alleviate parking
issues due to snow. This parking garage provide a valuable resource to a traffic and parking laden, crowded
neighborhood
The Sullivan courthouse parking issue presents the City with an opportunity to take into account these concerns and help
to limit the future impact that will be had on the neighborhood before making concessions to move the project along.
I recognize the developer has made a first step at negotiating to provide a grocery store within the parking structure, but I
don’t see how this in any way helps with parking and may conversely add to the need for more parking for the grocery
store itself. Also, with the existing Star Market at Twin City, a new proposed CVS on Cambridge Street, and a new
proposed Brothers Supermarket in Kendall, I don’t see the added benefit to the neighborhood.
A feasible option would be a reduction in the scope of the Courthouse project as a means to alleviate the need for parking
as I’d assume the 420 spots required is tied to the size of the project itself.
As a start to this process, a traffic study would help to identify current issues and might provide suggested ways to
facilitate parking and traffic issues; perhaps adding more one way streets as was done during the snow emergency to
restrict cut through traffic through East Cambridge and looking at ways to reroute traffic away from 3rd street and through
the neighborhood itself.
As it stands, I am against the use of the 420 municipal spots as a means to satisfy the private developer’s requirement nor
should these spots be traded away for token offers such as small supermarkets, hubway stations, bike lanes or increases
to affordable housing- all of which are important, though none of which truly address the significant issue at hand- parking
and traffic.

Agenda Item #13
DCAM letter to ECPT.pdf

Unfortunately, though I planned to be present this evening, I have come down with a nasty cold. As
such, I am submitting this email and attachment to be included in the record.

I understand that reconsideration of long term parking at the municipal garage in East Cambridge has
resurfaced after considerable hiatus. Legatt McCall was on clear notice of the zoning and strictures of
the zoning when they considered the purchase of the courthouse and signed the P&S Agreement
with the State. The P&S Agreement clearly provided that the property was subject to local zoning. I
have attached here to be included in the record DCAMM's letter to ECPT clearly defining their only
goal, to garner the greatest purchase price, with a clear warning that the property would be subject to
local zoning. That means zoning, including required parking, as this building would no longer enjoy
the sovereign immunity of that of a courthouse.

As many, if not all of you know, I am 4th generation East Cambridge. My mother actually picketed
outside this courthouse along with other residents, protesting the razing of an historic block and
courtyard to build this albatross. The city was absolutely helpless in protecting the residents since the
builder was the County and the courthouse was immune from enforcement of any zoning restrictions.

However, this time around the city holds the key. The Municipal Garage is well used and promised as a basis for many
variances already. Just say no to the longterm lease. Bring back some sanity into the process. You hold the key.

Mike lanes in front of businesses on Cambridge Street

I am a long-term customer of Skenderian pharmacy and other businesses in the immediate area while I appreciate the
cities concerns and needs to establish bike lanes I find that particularly along Cambridge street from Cambridge Hospital
to the library area the bike lanes seem to percent more of a hazard than a help in addition it makes it very difficult to
patronize all the businesses in that area
Please reconsider The current configuration Of bike lanes and parking which make it so difficult for people to patronize
the businesses on Cambridge Street thank you this is Donna Hill I am a Somerville resident and I specifically come to this
area frequently
