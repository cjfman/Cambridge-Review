WHY PLANT-BASED?

Communication: 650 West Kendall_20210323 (General Business)

OUR STORY
A craft beer entrepreneur, a world-renowned
impact investor, and a celebrity chef go plantbased for their health and the health of the
planet. Said entrepreneurs and said chef then
meet over oat milk lattes. They dream up a
concept that combines the world’s best craft
beers with plant-based versions of their
favorite pub foods. They call it, PlantPub.
Brilliant!

PUB FOOD FOR THE MODERN WORLD.
