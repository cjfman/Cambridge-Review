ORDERED:

ORDERED:
RESOLVED:

The City Manager has recently appointed a task force to determine the feasibility of
establishing an unarmed, alternative Public Safety Crisis Response System for the City of
Cambridge; and
The focus of the task force, as called for in a June 29, 2020 City Council Order, is
something of tremendous interest to people throughout the Cambridge community;
While the City Manager’s task force must be allowed to conduct their work to the best of
their ability, it would be prudent for the City Manager to convene one or more public
meetings in order for people to learn of the working group’s thinking, its working
process, and the recommendations this task force plans to present to the City Manager
before any such recommendations have been set in stone; and
Holding one or more of these public meetings would also allow members of the public to
weigh in regarding the potential recommendations as part of the official record; now
therefore be it
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to commit to holding one or more
public meetings – prior to the conclusion of the Task Force concerned with establishing
recommendations for an unarmed, alternative Public Safety Crisis Response System – in
order for the public to learn more about the task force’s thinking and recommendations
prior to their being formally considered; and be it further
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Task Force Co-Chairs to
issue monthly updates to the City Council (as part of the “Communications from Other
City Officers”) and to the public about the work of this task force; and be it further
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on
this matter in a timely manner; and be it further
That the City Council go on record renewing its commitment to transparency and public
engagement as the Future of Public Safety conversation develops.

VICE MAYOR MALLON
WHEREAS:

Governor Baker recently announced that the Commonwealth will move into Phase 2 of
its COVID vaccination plan on February 1st; and

WHEREAS:

Early education and K-12 workers were recently pushed back to be part of the third
priority group included in the Phase 2, meaning they will have to wait longer than
anticipated to be vaccinated; and

WHEREAS:

With an expansion of in-person learning slated to begin on March 1st and concerns
among Cambridge Public School (CPS) educators and staff over their personal health,
ensuring these employees are vaccinated as soon as possible is paramount; and

WHEREAS:

CPS educators and staff being vaccinated will also help restore families’ confidence
and trust in schools and in-person learning as being a safe option for their children,
helping parents return to the workforce while ensuring their children can access highquality in-person education; and

WHEREAS:

Given the ensuing delays in education workers’ vaccination, and the need for both staff
members and scholars to feel safe in in-person classrooms, it is critical that the City
remains proactive and has a plan in place to rapidly vaccinate CPS educators and staff
in convenient locations with ready availability when the times comes; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Public Health Department recently vaccinated all Cambridge first
responders, including firefighters, police officers, and EMTs in Operation Nightengale,
making it easy for first responders to obtain a vaccine locally and a similar plan could
be created to ensure timely delivery of vaccinations to CPS staff; now therefore be it

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge Public
Health Department, the School Department, and other relevant City departments to
develop a comprehensive plan to vaccinate CPS educators and staff, similar to
Operation Nightengale for first responders; and be it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter by the February
22nd general meeting.

legislation to allow acoustic music performances of five or fewer performers with no amplification
except for one microphone at licensed establishments in the City of Cambridge, without the
establishment being required to first obtain a license as required by G. L. c. 140, § 183A (the “Home Rule
Petition”) as requested by the City Council in Council Order No. O-9 of 11/16/20, and to discuss whether
the Board had any concerns. I write this as the Board’s designee and inform you that our consensus is
we have many concerns adopting or implementing the Home Rule Petition as proposed.
Specifically, the Board discussed that even though the City of Boston engaged in this type of
non-licensing through a pilot program, this type of program or Home Rule Petition would not work in
the City of Cambridge. Since 2016, the Board has done a comprehensive review of what was being
licensed under G. L. c. 140. The Board eliminated a lot of the “superfluous” categories that were being
licensed, eliminated the requirement to license categories which were not required to be licensed and
which did not affect the factors that the Board needs to consider per state law when issuing such
licenses. The Board focused on the categories listed in the state law, those that create noise, that may
affect the public safety, that may increase traffic, and all other considerations pursuant to state law.
The Board gave careful consideration not only to state law but also the City of Cambridge’s Noise
Ordinance and the nature of our City. Hence, the Board believes that the current licensing requirement
for live music is necessary and appropriate.
The Board discussed their concerns about the zoning issues that are implicated by the proposed
Home Rule Petition and which are not addressed or being discussed front and center. The way the City
is zoned would impede this type of entertainment in many, if not most, of the places that are not
currently licensed. It would be misleading and create unnecessary roadblocks for the businesses to
adopt such a Home Rule Petition when there would be zoning impediments or need for a variance.
There is also the issue that if this is allowed on any area of the licensed premises, those that have
outdoor areas and add this amenity to it, can end up adversely affecting street performers.
In addition, the City of Cambridge is very dense, commercial, and residential areas are often
mixed and intertwined, and our residents expect a peaceful and quiet City. The Board could not recall a
time when noise was not an issue one way or another in its last meetings. For example, in the meeting
where this was discussed the two disciplinary items on the agenda both related to noise
complaints/violations. Often, when a new establishment applies for a license, noise is a consideration
and one that is raised as a possible problem. Noise variances are often part of the matters considered

by the Board. Since the Board, License Commission and Police enforce the Noise Ordinance, the Board
understands that adopting such a Home Rule Petition would create a flurry of new and additional noise
complaints and raise a serious enforcement issue. Noise of this nature is actionable under the
Ordinance only if plainly audible from a distance of fifty (50) feet. This means that many times it is not
actionable because the complainant is closer than fifty (50) feet. In addition, even if it is actionable,
unless it is heard by the responding investigator or police officer, it is very hard to take action against
the business, which ends up frustrating the residents/complainants. We have people staying home
more and using home as an office. Prior and even during COVID-19, the noise complaints we receive are
not limited to late night, they include daytime and early evening. Allowing this without any licensing or
consideration to the residents surrounding the businesses would create an incredible problem.
The Board also raised safety concerns. Live music, even if limited to 5 people with instruments
and one microphone, take up a lot of space. Even ignoring the current space limitations we have with
COVID-19, you still need a dedicated space for these musicians and their equipment to ensure that they
(or their instruments) are not blocking the ingress/egresses, pathways or affect the minimal ADA space
requirements. There are a lot of small venues in Cambridge where adding this type of amenity without
review could end up creating safety issues for the employees and patrons.
The Board concluded that currently there is a way to apply to the License Commission for this
type of event/amenity either on an annual or daily basis. It is not a difficult process, and it is a process
that ensures that zoning approval is obtained, that if a variance is required one is obtained, or that if it is
not allowed because of zoning, that a license is not improperly issued. It is a process that allows the
public to express their concerns before the license is approved, and it is a process that allows the Board
and other regulating departments to dedicate staff to monitor to ensure common good and public
safety. It is not a cost prohibitive process and it is one that is necessary for this type of entertainment in
the City of Cambridge. Allowing such a Home Rule Petition would create an insurmountable number of
noise complaints, would result in places engaging in the practice against zoning and other legal
requirements, and would result in an unmanageable system for issues such as safety and enforcement
of laws and Ordinances.
Please let us know if you would like to discuss further. Thank you.

The Health & Environment Committee will conduct a public hearing to discuss amending the Tree
Protection Ordinance based on the findings of the Urban Forest Master Plan Task Force.
Councillor Zondervan called the meeting to order.
Councillor Zondervan opened the floor to public comment.
Lee Ferris, 269 Norfolk Street, spoke in support of updating the tree protection ordinance. She wanted to
examine ways to increase the city’s tree canopy.
Mike Nakagawa, 51 Madison Ave, spoke about factors affecting the city’s ability to increase the tree
canopy. He stated that some developers severely prune trees, then ask for a permit to cut it down later
after it dies or becomes sick.

Owen O'Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works, explained the history and provisions of the tree
protection ordinance. He explained that the report of the Urban Forestry Task Force will ultimately lead
to some proposed amendments to the ordinance.

Owen O'Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works added that 87% of the loss in the city, over the last 10year period has been on private property and 72% of the loss has been on residential private property.
Ms. Woodbury explained that the greatest opportunity for replanting is within residential properties. She
explained that the loss of one mature tree is more broadly felt than the loss of younger and smaller trees.
Andrew Putnam, Superintendent of Urban Forestry and Landscape, explained that there are six categories
that a person could request to remove a tree. The first category, dead or dangerous has received the vast
majority of applications at 73%. A total of 402 emergency circumstances or instances after a storm or
there's significant damage to a tree so that it needs to be removed somewhat immediately and poses a risk.
3% of all removals or 14 total significant utility infrastructure projects. One or two percent of trees filed
under category six which is that the tree poses a significant impact on an adjacent existing structure.
Ms. Woodbury explained that the city will propose amending the ordinance to include all private
properties and redefine what qualifies as a significant tree. She explained different scenarios where the
city encourages people to plant trees rather than paying into a mitigation fund. The city will propose an
amendment require a sign off by the city arborist certifying the tree plan as approved for large projects.

In response to a question from Councillor Carlone about tree planting, Mr. O'Riordan, stated that through
the hiring of additional staff the Department of Public Works could perhaps plant about between 1250 and
1500 trees. At the moment, private property owners’ plant between 250 and 300 trees a year. That still
leaves a significant difference between what is needed to reach 30% canopy coverage.
Mr. O'Riordan stated that the city is having discussions with MIT about tree planting on their campus and
athletic fields.
Councillor Zondervan gave the floor to Christopher Schmidt to provide public comment.

Catherine Woodbury, Project Manager at the Department of Public Works, gave a presentation to the
committee which is attached to these minutes. She explained that in order to stem the loss of the tree
canopy, at the current rate, the city would have to plant 1000 more trees annually than are currently being
planted. The overall goal from the technical report is to get all neighborhoods to at least have a 25%
canopy coverage. Stemming loss requires more than just planting new trees, it is a balance of planting and
limiting loss. Across all categories, residential, institution, commercial, etc., the greatest loss was on
residential properties.

In response to a question from Councillor Nolan about preventing the loss of trees, Mr. O’Riordan stated
that the vast majority of trees that have been removed are dead. A lot of the trees are dying due to age.
The canopy goes through cycles of decay and regrowth. He explained that there is an environmental
impact associated with removing soil and land filling soil. A better option is amending the existing soils.
Ms. Woodbury added that in addition to better soil management and planting practices, there are pruning
strategies that the city will be embarking upon in terms of getting trees earlier on in a pruning rotation.
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan about invasive/non-native trees, Mr. Putnam stated that
non-native trees already make up quite a large percentage of the canopy. The city has a goal of no more
than 5% of the canopy being from any one species, and no more than 10% from any one genus, in order
to have a resilient canopy.
In response to a question by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about mitigation costs, Mr. O’Riordan stated
that on a per inch basis, trees cost property owners $850 an inch to cut down, based on the city’s current
tree planting contracts.
In response to a question by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about invasive trees, Mr. O’Riordan stated that
invasive trees make up 20% of the canopy. Removing Invasive trees would have a significant impact on
the canopy.
Mr. Putnam added that the general harm of invasive species is that they displace native species, but it
does not pose a threat as long as the species that would displace natives are not allowed to move outward
or cause any issues.
In response to a question by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about having an arborist diagnose dead trees,
Mr. O’Riordan stated that there was a lot of discussion about the cost associated with bringing an arborist
on site to review whether a tree is dead or not. Residents have indicated that this is an onerous
requirement. The city believes that it is important that an arborist certify that the tree is dead.
Councillor Zondervan stated that the replacement strategy would be an area of challenge because
residential property owners, in particular, will have a space issue.
In response to a question by Councillor Carlone about reviewing site plans to ensure ample trees are being
planted, Mr. O’Riordan stated that in terms of special permit review the city does get a tree plan from the
development entity.

Councillor Zondervan called the meeting to order.
Mayor Siddiqui was also present.
Owen O'Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works, made a presentation which is attached to these minutes. He
reminded committee members that the proposed amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance include many ideas
that were generated through the urban forestry master planning efforts and through discussions with the 18-member
Urban Forest Master Plan Task Force. He said these suggestions are being made with the goals of addressing the
reduction in size of the tree canopy, as well as improving both tree health and awareness of these issues with respect
to climate change. He reviewed the origins of the tree protection ordinance. The amendment will encourage
additional planting across the city, but at the same time discourage the removal of trees. The amendments will
redefine a significant tree as one with a diameter (DBH) of 6-inches or greater at 4.5 feet (industry standard). Going
from 8-inches to 6 will qualify about 50% more trees for protection. The staff is examining the legality of having the
city arborist sign off on certificates of occupancy prior to those being issued. If a living significant tree is removed,
then an applicant will pay into a mitigation fund at the cost of about $1,000 an inch. This cost would be eliminated
for low-income homeowners, and would be reduced by 90% for homeowners with a residential exemption on their
property taxes and potentially by another 50% if a new tree is planted. The amendments will introduce the concept
of exceptional trees, which are 30-inch or greater diameter trees. They constitute about 3% of the trees in the city
and are worthy of additional protection. And we know they obviously have a significant ecological benefit in the
community. He said one option the council has to consider is to value those trees at 1.5 times the DBH.
He said the requirement for a tree survey would be removed from the definition section and redefined as something
that applies only to large projects. He said that for large projects, the tree plan would require the location, type,
heights, and DBH of all trees and those trees that have been removed from the lot within one year prior to the
submission of the study. He said that the council should consider expanding the look back period to be two years
instead of one. He said that anything beyond two years would be challenging for the city to manage. Commissioner
O’Riordan said that the definition of a replacement tree would be changed to reflect the concept of replacement trees
applying to other removal scenarios, as well as large project removals. He said that replacement trees can be planted
on the same lot or on another lot within the same neighborhood or an adjoining neighborhood.
Councillor Zondervan opened the floor to the committee.
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Mr. O'Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works stated that the
Task Force placed an emphasis on encouraging the replanting of trees on private property. He explained that the
taskforce received considerable input from the Conservation Law Foundation. They reviewed similar ordinances in
Atlanta and Providence.

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler confirmed that a replacement of an exceptional tree would be calculated at 1.5 times
the DBH of the tree removed. Mr. O’Riordan confirmed and stated that the staff estimates that about 3% of the trees
in the city are exceptional trees. He added that the staff are considering forming a committee to oversee the tree
replacement fund and using it to facilitate tree replacement and maintenance on private property.
Roy Russell, 40 Cottage Street, is opposed to the existing and proposed tree ordinance; it is punitive and will not
result in significant improvement in the tree canopy. He stated that someone with plenty of resources can easily
afford the cost of an arborist or an engineer or both. But someone who is a retired homeowner living on a fixed
income may be quite challenged to come up with funds needed to manage the trees. He encouraged the conversion
of private driveways to green space by implementing parking space maximums rather than the existing parking
space minimums.

In response to a question from Councillor Nolan about the look back provisions of the potential amendments, Mr.
O'Riordan stated that fs a developer proposes a large development, and clear cuts significant trees on that large
developments, six months ago, and the council eliminates the look back period, then the developer would be
afforded the same mitigation as a small residential property owner, rather than the more stringent mitigation
requirement that presently exists for large projects.
In response to a question about the legality of regulating the cutting of trees on private property by Councillor
Nolan, Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor, stated the law department does not believe that regulating the
removal of trees on a person’s property would constitute a taking of property.
Councillor Patricia Nolan stated that she would feel more comfortable getting a formal legal opinion prior to passing
any amendments. She did not support a blanket exemption for affordable housing projects.
With regard to potential amendments to section 8.66.055, Councillor Nolan stated that she supported the following
language:
“For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050: the total DBH of Replacement Trees required or the
Mitigation Payment of equivalent value shall be estimated as half the actual DBH of significant Trees to be
removed, If the total number of Replacement Trees is equal to the total number of Significant Trees to be removed
from a lot.”
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler supported valuing exceptional trees at 1.5 times their diameter. He did not support a
blanket exemption for affordable housing projects.
Councillor Zondervan suggested having the city pay the mitigation costs for affordable housing projects.
Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Nolan discussed extending the tree protection ordinance mortarium at the full
council while these changes are being finalized by staff.

20.930 Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Development.
20.930.1 Purpose. This Section is intended to establish a consolidated Master Plan review
procedure and specific modifications to development standards for phased, multi-site projects
seeking special permits within the provisions of Section 20.90 applicable to the Quadrangle
Northwest District (AOD-1). The primary purpose is to advance the objectives of the Alewife
District Plan and other applicable City policies and plans by encouraging well-planned
development incorporating desired land uses and public improvements.

the development on neighboring properties and the general public in terms of excessive
noise, lighting, wind, and shadows, and describing measures taken to mitigate such
impacts through building location and massing, arrangement of uses, screening, and
other building and site improvements; and
(13) Architectural Character Plan - describing general approaches to the design of
buildings, landscaped areas, streets, and pathways, identifying the type of visual
character that the development will aim to achieve, with the expectation that specific
designs of individual buildings and spaces will be reviewed in further detail as they are
developed.
20.930.3 Master Plan Approval. The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master
Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development Parcel,
subject to the following provisions:
(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the
Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria
applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the
following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special
Permit:
(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and
recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to
the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District,
including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility,
climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design
guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any
amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District;
(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood
and heat resilience recommended through the City’s Climate Change Preparedness and
Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and
(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for
bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the
Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated
into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that
accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable.
(4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in
general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The
Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place,
which is about 40-50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council
could add provisions in the “Criteria for Approval” section such as a minimum amount or
percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in
past mixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence
before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential
phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these
constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review
and approval by the Planning Board.
(5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan
as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District
Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at
different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum
parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to
mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use
Packet Pg. 104

3.8

would be established as follows:
a.
Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF
b.
Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF
c.
R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF
d.
Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF
e.
Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit
(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth
conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the
following conditions:
(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an
aggregate level and for individual building sites;
(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open
space;
(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to
transportation impacts and construction activity;
(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open
spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and
(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan,
including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation.
(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in
a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the
special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning
Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the
conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board
upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing
and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions.
(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific
modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written
determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine
whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment
according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning
Ordinance.
20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving
a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other
applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following
modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest
Master Plan Special Permit:
(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning
Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its
entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible
pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the
Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural
elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of
such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well
as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement
property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner
and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of
the Alewife District Plan .

(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of
eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2,
Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district,
provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any nonresidential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and
other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is
planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or
businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-facing or
community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the
Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for
such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer
Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively
occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building’s total Ground Story and the
Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as
described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include abovegrade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from the
street by principal-use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of eightfive (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this Paragraph.
(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation
above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as
established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further
increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story
finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such
finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the
City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those
standards to the development site.
(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are reserved for
light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a
consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy
Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of
Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range
of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District
Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle
Northwest Master Plan Special Permit.
(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board
shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development
and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility
Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.
(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for
yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set forth in Paragraph (2) of
Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to
conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in
the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as
approved by the Planning Board.

ORDINANCE NO. 2020-23 - FIRST PUBLICATON


In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-One
AN ORDINANCE
That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended on a petition by Arvind Srinivasau, et.
al. to create a new Section 20.95.5 “Additional Quadrangle Northwest District modifications” applicable
in the existing Alewife Overlay District – Quadrangle Northwest (indicated as “AOD‐1” on the Cambridge
Zoning Map).
Below is the petition language as amended by the City Council on March 1, 2021
20.930 Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Development.
20.930.1 Purpose. This Section is intended to establish a consolidated Master Plan review
procedure and specific modifications to development standards for phased, multi‐site projects
seeking special permits within the provisions of Section 20.90 applicable to the Quadrangle
Northwest District (AOD‐1). The primary purpose is to advance the objectives of the Alewife
District Plan and other applicable City policies and plans by encouraging well‐planned
development incorporating desired land uses and public improvements.
20.930.2 Master Plan Proposal. An application for special permits from the Planning Board for
development in the Quadrangle Northwest District under the provisions of the Alewife Overlay
Districts in Section 20.90, along with any other special permits requested, may be submitted in
the form of a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Proposal subject to the following provisions:
(a) Development Parcel. A Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel subject to the
provisions of this Section shall contain one or more contiguous or noncontiguous lots wholly
or partially within the Quadrangle Northwest District. The minimum size of a Development
Parcel shall be the greater of (1) three acres or (2) seventy‐five percent of the area of a lot
or combination of lots (a) in existence as of August 27, 2020 and (b) held in common
ownership as of August 27, 2020 where it is proposed to incorporate any portion of such lot
or lots within the Development Parcel.
(b) Aggregate Development Standards. For the purpose of a Quadrangle Northwest Master
Plan Proposal, the Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel shall be considered a single
lot for purposes of calculating allowable GFA and GFA bonuses, Floor Area Ratio, dwelling
units, parking, loading, bicycle parking, and open space requirements.
(c) Master Plan Proposal Submission. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Proposal shall
contain a list of special permits being sought, all other forms and documentation required

Zero Action Plan; and (iii) expected vulnerability of the development to the effects of
climate change, including increased precipitation, flood risk, temperature, and urban
heat island effect, and strategies to promote resiliency within individual building sites
and within the Master Plan as a whole, including natural stormwater management
systems, increased vegetation and shade, and measures to withstand and recover from
extreme climatological events, with reference to the recommendations of the City’s
relevant Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning documents;
(11) Transportation Plan ‐ incorporating: (i) a Transportation Impact Study required by
Section 19.20; (ii) a Shared Parking Study that identifies opportunities for reducing the

other building and site improvements; and
(13) Architectural Character Plan ‐ describing general approaches to the design of
buildings, landscaped areas, streets, and pathways, identifying the type of visual
character that the development will aim to achieve, with the expectation that specific
designs of individual buildings and spaces will be reviewed in further detail as they are
developed.
20.930.3 Master Plan Approval. The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest
Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development
Parcel, subject to the following provisions:
(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the
Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria
applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the
following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special
Permit:

Attachment: 210301.Alewife Quad -revised - First Publication (APP 2020 #39 : Zoning language relative to the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest

3.8.b

Packet Pg. 117

(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and
recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to
the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District,
including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility,
climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design
guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any
amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District;
(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood
and heat resilience recommended through the City’s Climate Change Preparedness and
Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and
(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for
bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the
Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated
into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that
accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable.
(4) Housing ‐ The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in
general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The
Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place,
which is about 40‐50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council
could add provisions in the “Criteria for Approval” section such as a minimum amount or
percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in
past mixed‐use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence
before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential
phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these
constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review
and approval by the Planning Board.
(5) Parking ‐ This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan
as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District
Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at
different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum
parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to
mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use
would be established as follows:
a.

Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF

b.

Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF

c.

R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF

d.

Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF

e.

Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit

3.8.b

Packet Pg. 118

(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth
conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the
following conditions:
(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an
aggregate level and for individual building sites;
(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open
space;
(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to
transportation impacts and construction activity;
(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open
spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and
(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan,
including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation.
(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in
a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the
special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning
Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the
conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board
upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing
and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions.
(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific
modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written
determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine
whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment
according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning
Ordinance.
20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving
a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other
applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following
modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest
Master Plan Special Permit:
(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning
Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its
entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible
pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the
Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural
elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of
such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well
as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement
property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner

and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of
the Alewife District Plan .
(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of
eighty‐five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2,
Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district,
provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any
non‐residential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading,
and other functions necessary to serve upper‐story uses or the building as a whole) is
planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or
businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer‐facing or
community‐focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the
Alewife District Plan, with floor‐to‐ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for
such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer
Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively
occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building’s total Ground Story and the
Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as
described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include
above‐grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from
the street by principal‐use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of
eight‐five (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this
Paragraph.
(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation
above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as
established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further
increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story
finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such
finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the
City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those
standards to the development site.
(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non‐residential building that are reserved for
light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a
consumer‐facing or community‐focused component as described in the Economy
Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of
Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range
of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District
Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle
Northwest Master Plan Special Permit.
(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board
shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development
and operation of off‐street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility
Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.
(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for

Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to
conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in
the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as
approved by the Planning Board.

Memorandum Regarding Proposed Ordinance
Restricting Use Of Chemical Riot Control Agents and Kinetic Impact Projectiles
I.

Authority of the Cambridge City Council to Pass the Ordinance
A.

General

The main authority for the City of Cambridge to pass ordinances regulating its police
force is found in G.L. c. 41, § 97, which plainly states that “selectmen may make suitable
regulations governing the police department and the officers thereof.” Under G.L. c. 40, § 21,
“[t]owns may … make such ordinances and by-laws, … as they may judge most conducive to
their welfare” which may include ordinances “(1) For directing and managing their prudential
affairs, preserving peace and good order, and maintaining their internal police.” (emphasis
added). See Thibeault v. Chief of Police of Fitchburg, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 364 (1977) (it is to
the city council that the legislature has committed the decision as to the proper operation of
police department); Chief of Police of Westford v. Westford, 365 Mass. 526, 532 (1974) (same).
In addition, “Towns [and cities] may . . . make such ordinances and by-laws, not
repugnant to law, as they may judge most conducive to their welfare, which shall be binding
upon all inhabitants thereof and all persons within their limits. . . (1) For directing and
managing their prudential affairs, preserving peace and good order, and maintaining their
internal police.” See G.L. c. 40, § 21 (emphasis added). This gives the City of Cambridge the
authority to pass an ordinance curtailing action by any actor so long as the act occurs within city
limits. This ordinance can be likened to the town of Amherst’s ban on certain firearms in 1981,
which was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court in Town of Amherst v. Attorney General, 398
Mass. 793, 796 (1986) (“It is fundamental that every presumption is to be made in favor of the
validity of municipal by-laws”) (“towns have the power to pass by-laws for the purpose of
preserving peace and order”).
Further, “[a]ny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment or repeal of local
ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to
confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general
court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court . . . and which is not denied, either
expressly or by clear implication, to the city or town by its charter.” G.L. c. 43A, § 13. This
suggests that, with limited exceptions not applicable to this situation, the Cambridge City
Council may pass ordinances that are not “inconsistent” with state law or the Massachusetts
constitution.
An ordinance will be valid unless there is a state or local law with clear legislative intent
to preclude local action. Id. While there is one state law that comes close to the issue of whether
Cambridge could ban other police entities from using certain tactics, that law is distinguishable.
Specifically, G.L. c. 41, § 98 provides “[t]he chief and other police officers of all cities and
towns . . . may carry within the commonwealth such weapons as the chief of police or the board
or officer having control of the police in a city or town shall determine; provided, that any law
enforcement officer of another state or territory of the United States may, while on official
business within the Commonwealth, carry such weapons as are authorized by his appointing
authority.” There is a distinction between carrying and using such weapons.

Attachment: Legal Memorandum re Cambridge Tear Gas Ordinance (COM 123 #2021 : A communication was received from Jeffrey M. Feuer)

5.2.a

1
Packet Pg. 183

Nor is § 98 in “sharp conflict” with the proposed ordinance. In Town of Amherst v.
Attorney Gen., the Supreme Judicial Court considered a by-law passed by the town of Amherst
prohibiting the use of certain firearms. 502 N.E.2d at 130–31. The regulations were challenged
as conflicting with state laws regulating hunting and the safe use of certain firearms. The court
held that Amherst’s by-law did not conflict with the state law regulating firearms because no
section of state law was “inconsistent with the by-law,” that the by-law did not “frustrate[]” any
sections of state law, and concluding that ‘[t]he mere existence of [a] state provision for some
matters within the purview of the by-law will not render [the by-law] invalid as repugnant to
law.” Id.
B.

Authority To Regulate State And Federal State Law Enforcement Officers

In general, a police officer lacks authority to act outside his or her jurisdiction, unless
specifically authorized by statute. See Commonwealth v. Savage, 430 Mass. 341, 343–346
(1999). The clear implication of this principle is that police officers operating within the City of
Cambridge, under the authority of the Cambridge Police Department, are therefore subject to the
same statutory mandates as any Cambridge police officer would be. The Massachusetts State
Police Rules of Conduct support the conclusion that state troopers are subject to ordinances
governing the City of Cambridge. See State Police Rules of Conduct, Rule 5.4.1 (“Members shall
obey all laws of the United States and of any country, state, or local jurisdiction in which the
members are present.”).
The authority to regulate federal authorities is less clear. The United States District Court
for the District of Colorado this past Spring issued a temporary restraining order enjoining “the
City and County of Denver, and specifically the Denver Police Department and officers from
other jurisdictions who are assisting Denver Officers, from employing chemical weapons or
projectiles of any kind against persons engaging in peaceful protests or demonstrations.” Abay v.
City of Denver, No. 12-cv-01616-RBJ, ECF No. 16 (D. Col. June 5, 2020) (emphasis added).
The Court also specifically ordered that “Non-Denver officers shall not use any demonstration of
force or weapon beyond what Denver itself authorizes for its own officers. Any non-Denver
officer permitted to or directed to be deployed to the demonstrations shall be considered an agent
of Denver such that Denver shall ensure such officer is limiting their use of force to that
authorized by the Defendant.” Id.
II.

Severability

The severability clause included in the ordinance will ensure that if a portion of the
ordinance is successfully challenged, the remainder of the ordinance will remain in effect. When
courts sustain a challenge to part of a piece of legislation, the invalid portion is severed, saving
the remainder, “unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions
which are within its power, independently of that which is not.” I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919,
931-32 (1983). See also Peterson v. Commissioner of Revenue, 444 Mass. 128, 137-28 (2005)
(“When a court is compelled to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute and is obliged to
declare part of it unconstitutional, the court, as far as possible, will hold the remainder to be
constitutional and valid, if the parts are capable of separation and are not so intertwined that the
Legislature could not have intended that the part otherwise valid should take effect without the
invalid part.”). Where, as here, it is the intent of the drafters to ensure that the ordinance remain

5.2.a

Packet Pg. 184

valid should any portion be invalidated, a severability clause unambiguously conveys that
legislative intent to a reviewing court. I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. at 932.
III.

Private Right Of Action

Sections 6 and 7 of the Massachusetts Home Rule Amendment (“HRA”), Article 89 of
the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, allow a city or town to adopt local
ordinances without prior approval of the state legislature as long as those ordinances are not
inconsistent with the state constitution or laws passed by the state legislature. In particular, HRA
§ 7(5) states that a city may “enact private or civil law governing civil relationships [which is] an
incident to an exercise of an independent municipal power ....” As our Supreme Judicial Court
has often stated, “§ 6 of the HRA undoubtedly grants municipalities broad powers to adopt bylaws for the protection of the public health, morals, safety, and general welfare, of a type often
referred to as the ‘police’ power.” CHR Gen., Inc. v. Newton, 387 Mass. 351, 355 (1982).
In Marshal House, Inc. v. Rent Review & Grievance Bd., 357 Mass. 709, 718 (1970), the
court stated that the language of HRA § 7(5), required “viewing separately the various
component powers making up the broad police power, with the consequence that a municipal
civil law regulating a civil relationship is permissible (without prior legislative authorization)
only as an incident to the exercise of some independent, individual component of the municipal
police power.” That requirement is clearly met by the statutory grant of authority to city or town
selectmen to make “suitable regulations governing the police department and the officers
thereof” under G.L. c. 41, § 97.
Moreover, our courts have held that police officers, in accepting employment by the
public, implicitly agree that they will not engage in conduct which calls into question their ability
and fitness to perform their official responsibilities and that they may face discipline and liability
if they fail to do so by violating laws designed to regulate police conduct. See Police Com'r of
Boston v. Civil Service Com'n, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 371 (1986); McIsaac v. Civil Service
Com'n, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (1995) (Police officer discharged for violating department
regulation prohibiting conduct unbecoming an officer by negligently handling firearm while
intoxicated and verbally abusing other officers); City of Boston v. Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association, 477 Mass. 434 (2017) (discussion of choke holds and protection of public from
excessive use of force by police).
Further, there is “no case law of significance” that states that municipalities may not
create private rights of action consistently with the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts
Constitution. See generally Paul A. Diller, The City and the Private Right of Action, 64 Stan. L.
Rev. 1109, 1167 & n.319 (2012). In the absence of such law, the proposed ordinance can
include a private right of action.

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
Thank you for voting against the CCF petition for Alewife.
I want to include for the record the full comments from the Cambridge Residents Alliance in opposition to the CCF
petition; please see attached.
I look forward to working with you to develop more comprehensive zoning for the Alewife Quad that meets residents’
goals.
Thank you for your hard work,

Dear Mayor and Councilors,
The Cambridge Residents Alliance feels the Council should let the petition to up-zone the NW Quad
area of Alewife expire.
1. There is still no solid guarantee of a bridge over the railroad tracks. The developer says that it
would be “desirable” for the bridge to accommodate a passenger shuttle, but does not promise
that.
2. Housing. The language (which was proposed by the city’s CDD) about when housing must be
completed is not strong enough. CDD’s language says that up to 60% of the lab/ commercial space
can be built before even starting on the residential buildings. CDD’s language leaves the creation of
the phasing plan to the special permit stage of development, when the zoning has already been
passed and negotiation with the Council is no longer possible. Instead, the phasing should require
early completion of the housing and completion of the entire project within a 10-year time frame.
Further, the Envision Alewife plan did not include this much housing in this corner of the Quad;
instead, this area was supposed to be the light industrial area of the Quad.
3. Benefits. The developer's zoning offers community benefits based on just 16 out of the 26 acres
of the land being upzoned. If the developer were to buy the adjoining parcels—and they have
bought two more parcels-- they would get the upzoning without having to provide any additional
benefit. And the bridge is the primary community benefit being offered; there is no space for a
public park, firehouse, school or other major amenity.
4. Parking supply was reduced to match the ratios stated in Envision (net reduction from 700 to 500
spaces); this is still a lot. We like that there would be a shared garage equipped with 25% of spaces
with EV charging stations and designed to be 100% EV-ready.
5. The developer committed to solar/green roofs on the three residential and parking garage
buildings, but not on the three lab/office buildings.
6. Trust. This is the same developer that bought land for housing in East Cambridge, but never built
that housing, and then sold the land to Eversource for a huge electric substation that would have
been too close to a residential neighborhood.
7. There is still no mention of the actual Letter of Understanding in the most recent zoning
language. Without that, nothing in the commitment letter is enforceable.
We request you to vote to let the petition expire.
Sincerely,
Lee Farris, President
Cambridge Residents Alliance

Ban Tear Gas

Hello,
I am with the Harvard College Young Democratic Socialist Association, and I am fully in support of a ban on tear gas
within Cambridge. As last summer showed, it is absolutely unnecessary for police to have the ability to use chemical
weapons on the populace for any reason. I fully support Policy Order #51.

John Chun to City Council 2021-03-15.docx

Good evening. I’m John Chun from 48 Loomis St. I’m here to speak against CC&F’s AOD-1 zoning petition.
CC&F is asking the height limit to be increased from the current 55’ to 85’ plus up to 4’ for flood control and additional
height for rooftop mechanicals, all of which may result in buildings over 110’ tall. In our many conversations with CC&F,
we requested the overall height to be reduced to 85’, including flood control elevation and rooftop mechanicals, which
is more than what the current zoning allows. Unfortunately, CC&F has rejected our request.
CC&F claims they need the height to utilize the bonus FAR of 0.25 from building a bridge over the railroad tracks and all
the GFA exemptions they’re seeking.
This bridge, given its location, will mostly be self-serving for CC&F’s tenants. The Highlands already has Fitchburg Cutoff
Path to get to Alewife and the bridge is too far west to serve the rest of the Quad effectively. When the bridge has
limited public benefit, why should the City allow them the entirety of the 0.25 bonus FAR and let them build almost
twice the height of what the current zoning allows?
There are plenty other developers in the area that are building within the current zoning, such as The Davis Companies,
IQHQ, and West Cambridge Science Park, just to name a few. The lab buildings recently built by The Davis Companies on
the nearby Wilson Road are a single story or well below the maximum height allowed by the current zoning with
generous open space and setbacks. So why can’t CC&F do the same?
CC&F has been purchasing more lots in the Quad. Approving this petition and allowing CC&F to build oversized buildings
will lead to overcrowding in the Quad. We need to carefully review Traffic Impact Study, Infrastructure Planning, and
Climate Change Impact Study before rushing to a decision.
We want to build a true neighborhood in the Quad through well planned development that can provide lasting benefits
to everyone.
Thank you.

Support for Policy Order #51 to Ban Tear Gas

Dear Cambridge City Council and City Clerk,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing in support of Policy Order #51, which would ban tear gas, a substance whose use
was banned by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, and yet has been used by police officers in cities across the country.
Cambridge has a responsibility to take a stand for the rights of all people, including the right not to be sprayed with
chemical weapons. I hope that the council takes action today in support of human dignity.
Thank you,

City Council Public Comment 3/15

To the esteemed City Council I'm Monty Montero-Elliott, longtime Cambridge resident. I can't make it to the meeting tonight but I wanted to write in
to express my views about some agenda items.
Tear Gas Ban
•

•
•

I am in support of the ban on tear gas. Tear gas is a dangerous and caustic chemical weapon with numerous
well-documented damaging short-term and long-term health effects. It is outlawed in international warfare.
There's no reason it should be used in Cambridge.
Moreover, it's impossible to control who gets hit by it, since it's a gas and just disperses into the air. People who
aren't the wielder's intended targets could and likely will get hurt by it, too.
There are other, better ways to "crowd control," if that's the main concern. Anyone who's been unlucky enough
to be on the wrong side of tear gas can tell you that deployment of tear gas often escalates a situation
further as folks scramble blind to escape the clouds of burning chemicals hurting their eyes and lungs.

Reconsideration #1 - Policing Task Force Transparency
•

•
•

•
•

I stand with The Black Response, Project Right to Housing, Our Revolution Cambridge, and many of my fellow
community members in insisting that the data from previous Policing Task Force meetings (recordings, minutes,
agenda items, pertinent documents, etc.) must be uploaded to the Internet for public access.
I also urge the task force to allow public attendance to these meetings.
There is simply no acceptable substitute for transparency. I am not an important person politically, but public
safety includes my safety, too, and the safety of my family and neighbors. I can't feel safe or confident in the
future of public safety if I don't know what's going on in these meetings, or what kinds of conversations are
being had.
Given that there is no acceptable substitute for transparency, I do not support Councilor Simmons' proposed
amendment to Councilor Zondervan's policy order.
I also call for any and all future meetings of this task force to be recorded and uploaded to the public along with
the minutes, agenda items, pertinent documents, etc., and for these meetings to allow public attendance.

Thank you for your attention.
Best,
Monty Montero-Elliott

Quadrangel Norhwest rezoning Petition

To the Honorable City council,
Please record my opposition to the proposed zoning sponsored by CC&F in the Alewife Quadrangel. Notwithstanding
many well intended efforts to get this developer to play by the rules and to honor the City’s Envision efforts to plan this
important area of the city so that it will be a compliment to the adjacent neighborhoods and the city for the long haul,
this rezoning proposal will simply increase the value of CC and F’s land acquisitions and allow this developer to flip the
property to his financial advantage. A process which he has followed in East Cambridge on Fulkerson street.
The wisest action would be to allow this petition to die and to move rapidly to have the community development
department prepare a proper zoning petition that identifies the criteria for development, which should include the
provision of space for public facilities to serve the new population that would be added , would insure that the flood
protection provisions are fully honored, connections across the RR tracks are guaranteed and a firm set of public
benefits are insured from any development in the quadrangle zone…
Respectfully,
O. Robert Simha

Dear City Council and Clerk Wilson:
Cambridge residents need your help-- to fulfill your duty of standing up for Truth vs. Treason, on our behalf:

PURSUANT TO 18 USC 4, AND 18 USC 2382, we are hereby serving you LEGAL NOTICE
of felonies that have been committed, that you are required to acknowledge. If you fail or
refuse to, your act of omission will be construed as "aiding and abetting" these crimes, and you
will be considered a party in these crimes, and stripped of your authority/office, and this material
will be sent to the federal court for prosecution. Again, you have been given LEGAL
NOTICE. We will expect a notice and report by you describing your response within a
week. Failure to do this will result in a criminal and civil legal action against you in your personal
and corporate capacities.
PLEASE CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN OPEN AND ACCESS (read, share) the file linked here:
https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:d442443f-3b4b-4ef7-8247-1e49ece12e8c

Thank You in advance for your service in this matter. To assist in this landmark effort by U.S. citizens, I am sharing with
you the above link to a large evidentiary PDF re: crimes committed against America. It enumerates myriad instances of
crucial, strategic irregularities in the 2020 U.S. presidential election (also probably elections at other levels), regarding
which up to 2,000 affidavits have been submitted nationwide. Tens of millions of Americans now require that:
•

These and other such election irregularities at the local level be considered on the basis of substance / merit -and all paper ballots cast and the entire election process be investigated through a COMPLETE, TRANSPARENT
FORENSIC AUDIT for the election results to be rectified, if found to have been compromised by substantial
irregularities.

•

No executive orders issued by the Biden administration be implemented or enforced until the 2020 elections
have been comprehensively investigated and verified, since his "election" / installation has been so fraught
with controversy, including amongst expert analysts at the highest levels of technology and the U.S. military-when courageous enough / sufficiently uncompromised to speak out. In fact, the 37 executive orders now
passed by the current administration indicate that America is now being governed by diktat rather than
representation...a concept Joe Biden himself has voiced:

There is more to the U.S. Constitution than process: Although "process" may have been "followed" (according to the
letter rather than the spirit of the law?) in recent months regarding cases of election fraud submitted to courts,
the substance of most cases has not been respected for the rule of law to be applied for the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE
OF THIS CENTURY-- which is outrageous, appalling, and frankly horrifying to many Americans.
Courts in recent months have dismissed cases re: election irregularities for being too early / "not ripe" --and then, when
those same cases were resubmitted a little later, for being too late / "moot": conveniently taking advantage,
apparently, of certain terms' IMprecision to exploit judges' apparent discretion to interpret matters as “not ripe” or
“moot” if no OPTIMAL or PRECISE timing has ever been specified for legal cases' submission...a gaping loophole that
must be fixed to address this most crucial issue in U.S. history: to protect free and fair U.S. elections. Americans
nationwide are sufficiently fed up about current "process" to step up and try to better ensure, to the best of our
abilities, that all evidence is thoughtfully, carefully considered:
* A judge in Arizona late last month did order enforcement of a subpoena issued against Maricopa County to
produce 1.2 million paper ballots cast there for inspection, which will likely show massive deceit perpetrated
there:

* The New Hampshire House Election Law Committee voted UNANIMOUSLY 20-0 on SB 43 to send to the full
House "legislation outlining a full, detailed audit by a team of experts of the Nov. 3 election results in the town of
Windham" --of the Diebold Accuvote voting machines in Windham, NH, since Republican candidates who had
won election were found to have been cheated out of 300 votes per candidate. (This legislation may be called the
Gardner Amendment; it is supported by Secretary of State William Gardner.)

* Wisconsin lawmakers are reviewing to rehold a general election, following news that a Democrat operative was
given keys to an absentee ballot counting room in Green Bay:

* An organizer in Georgia, Eric Warren, is filing petitions to recall Governor Kemp and Secretary of State Brad

OPPOSITION TO COOKIES CANNABIS
PLANNING BOARD LETTER CANNIBIS COOKIES March 13.docx

Dear Planning Board,
Please find attached my letter opposing the Cookies Cannabis superstore on 57 JFK.
This is about its location and size which takes up one side of Winthrop Park and
innate to a successful Cannabis store is expanding the new and repeat customers
in the middle of underage students and other youths. Yes, Cannabis is legal but
at what point is the city responsible for protecting the public at large?
No one is discouraging Cookies from opening a store in Harvard Square, just at this
location.

Dear Planning Board,
I am writing in OPPOSITION to Blue Enterprises/
Cookies Cannabis franchise at 57 JFK, a flagship
national chain that will impact the park, congestion,
residents and how Harvard Square will be perceived.
With its expansive traffic and lines, a
superstore at this location loudly
glamorizes a legal but still controlled substance aimed at the mostly underage student crowd being groomed through cartoons as the next generation
to contribute to the lucrative bottom line. If this was a LIQUOR STORE, I’d feel
the same way. As stated in national promotion, “Cookies is more than a
premiere cannabis company, it is a lifestyle”. I’m sure universities and parents would love
to hear that. If this was a bookstore, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. The
Cookies partnership is not being discouraged for opening a store in Harvard Square, just
not at this location.

With all the construction in Harvard Square, retail spaces are in
disarray, yet, two minority-owned Cannabis stores (Church St- L)
have already been approved in the square -one with family
connections to Cookies- 297 feet away on Winthrop St. With
legalization, the moral and health question concerning Pot is almost
moot. Yet, more research and information surfaces about adverse health consequences
of recreational marijuana. A significant percentage of research indicates that it is far from
benign. A “successful” Cannabis business is predicated on a new and
repeating customer base. Cookies has 6 cash registers in anticipation of
volume. How can enticing more people to use drugs solve the problem of
inequity? Does this “level the playing field” and address past drug
enforcement policies? Have we learned nothing from alcoholism and
substance abuse? Horrific police behavior should be addressed separately. Unlike medical
marijuana, this location is maximizing profits for a corporation and ignores the unintended
consequences. The question becomes at what point does society have a responsibility to
protect the public over personal gain? Lost in these discussions is the question of why
Cannabis remains a controlled so therefore problematic substance and how it continues to
contribute to social maladies triggering the need for crisis and social programs.
The experience from other municipalities with Cookies dispensaries should give us pause.
The city of West Hollywood is officially requesting that the city of Los Angeles revoke the

Attachment: Marille Meyer_PLANNING BOARD LETTER CANNIBIS COOKIES March 13 (COM 132 #2021 : A communication was received from

Packet Pg. 200

temporary operating license for Cookies Cannabis Dispensary and deny Cookies a
permanent license due to residential complains of illegal parking, jaywalking, public
consumption of product and alcohol, trash and noise. These are real issues based on illegal
behavior. Armed security guards can’t control use beyond their designated area. A large
space in the Crema/ Asana block of buildings may be equally as lucrative without the
impact on Winthrop Park. The applicant team is very impressive, well-prepared and
sophisticated. And they are doing a good job at arguing that they are not a franchise from
the California Corporation --but with all the licensing, marketing and product, who owns
the 51%?
The entrepreneurs also have the support from city councilors who have seemed to ignore
the real trepidation residents, associations, businesses and schools have over the location
and impact of the Blue Enterprise/ Cookies flagship enterprise. We have activist councilors
chiding the concerns voiced by their constituencies while they lobby on the petitioner’s
behalf. Councilors who are elected to represent ALL citizens should not lobby cases before
a subordinate committee. They continue to have their thumb on the scale backed up by the
final vote. So why bother deliberating. Instead of putting all this effort in supporting a
superstore, perhaps the councilors could put their energies into supporting Harvard
Square businesses. It would also be helpful to understand what the responsibilities, if any,
Equity Empowerment applicants have to the community at large while being
acknowledged.
Please reconsider permitting of Blue Enterprise/ Cookies franchise before traffic and
crowd studies can be completed. We also have for guidance the experience of Melrose St,
West Hollywood, which wants to revoke Cookies’ permit. Moving this petition forward is
premature with predicable problems on the horizon.
Thank you.

Upzoning petition by Cabot, Cabot and Forbes

Dear Mayor Sidiqqi and City Councilors,
I am writing to ask you to oppose the upzoning petition by Cabot, Cabot and Forbes. The promise of housing is tempting
to some, mainly due to the 20% inclusionary. I live at the Atmark Apartmemt Building in the Quadrangle in such a unit. I
am the only inclusionary zoning unit resident who is still there from the time I moved in and I desperately want to leave
as well. The building is horribly constructed and a miserable place to live. Moving is difficult for me as I have no one to
help. Please don’t let others end up trapped like me by a developer who wants to make easy money and then sell as
soon as the project is completed. The City and its residents need to plan the Quadrangle and not the developer whose
sole motive is profit
I ask you not to allow a developer's last minute negotiation to pressure you into thinking this is the only option for the
city. I believe the bridge the developer is dangling in front of us will really only help the workers and residents of this one
property. It is in a strange location and does not allow for a true shuttle, just a golf cart. The developer needs the bridge
and will build it anyway.
Jay Dougherty has lied to Cambridge before and he will again. My building is supposed to be LEED silver but it is not.
Bozzuto, the management company which Mr. Dougherty uses, is the worst in the city. Ask Elizabeth Winston at the
Just-A-Start mediation program or anyone in the CDD’s housing division.
There are many other reasons for voting down this petition including listening to what residents who live here want and
climate crisis conditions which are already impacting this area.
Thank you for your attention.
Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins

Order 08 and Reconsideration #1

To the council:
I am writing to strongly urge you to vote in favor of adopting a city tear gas ban (Order 8). I understand Cambridge Police
Commissioner is willing to create a department policy which is commendable but I feel that is important to have an
ordinance that will survive beyond particular personnel. Tear gas is a highly dangerous and potentially lethal substance.
In fact, tear gas is so dangerous that it was banned for use in warfare after World War I by the 1925 Geneva Protocol.
Something that is too dangerous for use in war is surely too dangerous for us on our city streets. I understand that the
Cambridge City Solicitor believes such a ban violates state law but Somerville and Boston have found ways to draft such
ordinances. Cambridge can and should draft an ordinance modelled on those of our neighbors.
I am also writing in strong support of increasing the transparency of the Future of Public Safety Task Force
(Reconsideration #1). The task force’s current method of operating is in direct contradiction with the stated goals of the
task force to seek “widespread engagement” and work collaboratively with the City Council. The public should be given
notice of and be able to observe all meetings of this task force. I understand that there has been concerned that
residents may provide sensitive testimony. There are certainly ways to protect people in such instances without closing
all or even most meetings to the public.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Louise Parker

Please support PO#5 ending the embargo of Cuba

Dear Councillors,
I would like to talk from first hand experience about the consequences of the US embargo on Cuba. I have
been traveling back and forth to Cuba since 1969, lived there for much of the 1970s, spent several months
each year in Cuba in the 1980s and 90s and since retiring in 2-15 now spend winters in Cuba. Half of my
daughter's family is in Cuba and many others in Florida. For 50 years I have watched our family and friends in
Cuba suffer the effects of the U.S. Embargo. In the early years, it would take 3 days to make a phone call to
Cuba. With WhatsApp it is now easier. There still is no way to have reliable internet there: Cuba is prohibited
from accessing the underwater broadband cable that runs 3 miles offshore of Havana on its way to South
America. When my nephew, now in his 50s was a child, we had to spend hours and hours searching Havana
for the epilepsy medicine he needed, until Cuba figured out how to make it in their own laboratories. Still,
coming to Cuba just last week, I had to bring aspirin, heart medicine, blood thinners, glucose strips, asthma
inhalers, neuropathy and other medicines because the embargo stepped up by Trump is leaving friends and
friends of friends without. Yes, Cuba should be producing all its own food, its own toothpaste and soap, its
own spare parts, its own medical equipment: But where is it going to get the raw materials to do so? No
company with even 10% of a US interest is allowed to sell to Cuba. No ship that wants to dock in a US port
can also dock in Cuba to drop off goods en route.
In financial terms: Since the US broke ties with Cuba and then launched the full embargo through presidential
executive order in 1962, the U.S. embargo has cost Cuba an estimated $685 million per year. Between April
2018 and March 2019, the embargo cost Cuba $104 million, 148 thousand 178 dollars in health care alone.
Since the start of Covid 19 in March 2019, Cuba has been blocked at every turn in purchasing PPEs but also
the raw materials it needs to manufacture medicines that it must produce itself because it is blocked from
purchasing them from any company with even a tiny percent of US interest. And also hospital equipment: in
April 2020 a US interest bought the Swiss company from which Cuba was buying ventilators and so Cuba was
prohibited from buying ventilators. Fortunately as well as donations from several countries, Cuba was able to
take advantage of an open source ventilator invented at MIT and has been able to make do.
The embargo also costs the United States. Not only in trade, estimated at a potential 1.2 billion a year but also
during this horrendous crisis of Covid 19, the US is unable to purchase life saving medicines that Cuba has
invented and uses successfully for treatment of severe Covid 19, including the cytokine storm, and to assist in
immune protection in the elderly: Biomodulina, Interferon Alfa 2-B, Itolizumab, Jusvinza, Nasalferon, and now
Cuba’s successful -- and cheap -- vaccines. On October 5, the Cambridge City Council passed unanimously a
Policy Order calling for collaboration with Cuba. Hopefully in the next weeks or month, we will have a

to handle this dreadful scourge and ways to collaborate. There continues to be a Memorandum of
Understanding between the US Dept of Health and the Cuban Ministry of Health: Nothing stops our talking to
each other, or even working together, at least by zoom.
Meanwhile, President Biden has in his hands the possibility of lifting some of the most onerous measures of
the embargo. By executive order, with the stroke of a pen, he can allow Western Union and other transmittal
agencies to resume sending remittances from Cuban families in the U.S. to Cuban families in Cuba. He can
restore full staffing to the U.S. embassy in Cuba so that Cubans can process visas to visit, live and work in the
United States. He can restore the right of scientists to hold joint conferences with their peers in Cuba. He can
take Cuba off the list of terrorist countries that further blocks Cuba in making purchases abroad. He can make

Opposed to Zoning Petition APP 2020#39

Dear Councillors,
We are writing to express opposition to APP 2020#39 – the proposal to up-zone 26 acres in the Alewife Quadrangle.
Development of such a large parcel should only come after the City has reviewed the proposals in Envision Cambridge –
proposals that came out of many hours of discussion by Cambridge residents who know the area.
The Cabot Cabot & Forbes proposal was developed before Covid-19 changed what people look for in housing. Apartment
buildings – without parks, meaningful green space, shops, restaurants, library, lower schools, or health centers – will not
attract long-term residents. The economics of office building have also changed as some employees will continue to work
remotely. The roads around the parcel are already subject to traffic gridlock – further diminishing the viability of the CCF
proposal. Beyond these considerations, the development sits in a flood plain, which will have have continuing monetary
consequences for residents, workers, and for the City. A proposed developer-funded pedestrian/bicycle bridge over the
railroad tracks will not come close to covering other costs associated with this development.
Please reject this ill-advised proposal.
Sincerely,
Annette LaMond

BE ADVISED, pursuant to 18 U.S. Code § 2382 (Misprision of treason), 18 U.S. Code § 4
(Misprision of felony), I am hereby providing you LEGAL NOTICE of information and
evidence (see attached exhibits) that represent a national security threat and must be acted upon
immediately. Failure to act on your part will be a violation of the these and other laws of the
United States of America. The information is as follows:
Overwhelming evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that Joe Biden is not the President of
the United States of America, despite the propaganda machine (mainstream media, democrats,
fake republicans, etc.) attempting to bully and brainwash Americans into believing he is.
A team of analysts, including Scott Bennett, were in Washington DC not long ago, and worked
with General Michael Flynn s team (and others) on examining the evidence and affidavits from
the technical experts who provided the proof not only of election fraud, but of treason and
espionage and cyber warfare attacks. Without disclosing too much or identifying people that
might be put in danger, his affidavit establishes with absolute authority that the materials
provided by the military personnel, the cryptologists, the attorneys, and the analysts prove
beyond any doubt that the election on November 3, 2020, was a corrupt fraud and act of high
treason committed, and an act of war by China.
Bennett sat down with experts over several weeks, and saw some amazing things, documents,
videos, and other materials that both enraged and nauseated him. He interviewed technical
geniuses who provided testimony and evidence clearly showed me that Barak Obama, John
McCain, Mitt Romney, John Brennan, and others committed high treason and should be
prosecuted and promptly executed for their crimes. So damaging was the material they were
analyzing, that they had CIA—and most likely Mossad—hacking into their phones, their
computers, planting microphones, setting up “honey-traps”, and breaking into their hotel rooms
searching for our evidence. As a result, they were moved around to different hotels every few
days, and surrounded by gun-carrying Navy SEALS, U.S. Marshalls, and Special Forces
soldiers.
Essentially, Joe Biden s presidential election was the result of a multidimensional fraud that
consisted of 1) mail-in ballots justified by the Covid-19 Chinese virus, 2) Chinese Communist
Party purchased Dominion voting machines with software that manipulated the election numbers
to a pre-determined percentage, 3) fake ballots transported into vote counting polls to reflect the
fake computer manipulations of the numbers, and 4) delusional democrats, fake republicans, and
a mainstream media that was hysterical and obsessed with removing Donald Trump by all means
necessary. The Supreme Court also seemed to play a passive-aggressive role by abandoning its
constitutional duty to rule on controversies between the states—and nothing is more
controversial that evidence of a corrupted election of a person controlled and bribed by foreign
nations.

LEGAL NOTICE: EXECUTIVE ORDERS OF BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AS TREASON

Packet Pg. 208

Of course the implication of this election is that those nations and people supporting Joe Biden
are going to attempt to control, dominate, brainwash, imprison, or destroy anyone who supported
Donald Trump, and erase every political act of Donald Trump. We see this already with Biden s
executive orders to stop the border wall construction, subjugate America to the Paris Climate
Treaty, assist foreign people to invade America illegally and grant them citizenship to vote, and
morally destroy Americans through a fascist transgender-homosexual agenda to indoctrinate the
population. All of these actions may of course ignite a civil war in America.
As a result of the overwhelming evidence, we can clearly see that the election of Joe Biden was a
fraud, and as a result has no lawful power or legitimacy; and therefore no word, order, policy, or
instruction from Joe Biden or his representatives has any authority, power, or legitimacy, and
should not be accepted or obeyed in any way. To do so would clearly be an act of treason.
The strategy we should use to counteract the false and dangerous Biden orders, is as follows:
1. Make phone calls and emails and letters to Members of Congress, the Governor of your
State, and local government officials, and state BE ADVISED, in accordance with 18
U.S. Code § 2382 (Misprision of treason), 18 U.S. Code § 4 (Misprision of felony), you
are being given legal notice of a felony, and failure to act on your part will be construed
as a crime, and you will be prosecuted in your corporate and individual capacity.
2. Use this document as a NOTICE OF LEGAL SERVICE that all orders, policies, and
instructions from the Joe Biden Administration are unlawful and unconstitutional due to
the overwhelming evidence of fraud and corruption.
3. Collect the legal filings and exhibits provided by attorneys Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani,
Patrick Byrne, and Phil Kline as evidence of this fraud and corruption, and demand that it
not only be acknowledged by state and federal courts and government agencies as factual
and accurate, but that indeed it mandates the rejection of all Biden Administration claims
of Presidential authority by said courts and government agencies.
4. Declare that any political or government person or agency (majors, town councils,
supervisors, members of Congress, police, judges, etc.) that does not reject as unlawful
all claims, instructions, and orders from the Biden Administration, are violating the
constitution, have abdicated their authority, and are complicit in treason against the
constitution of the United States, as well as the State Constitutions.
5. Send this notice by certified mail to all courts, judges, members of Congress, Military
leaders, and state and local government officials; churches and media.
6. Request that these Executive Orders be prosecuted pursuant to: 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1512,
and other laws.
Truth is the best psychological operation, and the natural antiseptic for lies, and rejection of
tyrants and their orders is the duty of free men to both God and others.

There is now a wide array of empirical evidence that the
2020 election was not like others. Whether you are
already believe that there was widespread fraud or you
are a skeptic, the purpose of this document is to
summarize a snapshot of the most compelling evidence,
including: eye witness accounts and confessions of fraud,
technological vulnerabilities, statistical anomalies, voting
irregularities, illegal voting, and audits of actual voting
machines.
You might be wondering: if there's evidence, why has it
not gone through the judicial system? Courts have
dismissed the cases without ever hearing the evidence.
This is just a very small set of evidence we have compiled
over the course of six weeks, but we are fully convinced
that this election was stolen from President Trump and
we must do everything possible to defend our Republic.
Our weapon is the truth, and our advocate is the Lord.

There are many examples of election officials directly
participating in voter fraud, but perhaps the most
notorious example is in the battleground state of Georgia
by Ruby Freeman and her daughter.
An October 26th Facebook live by Ruby Freeman in Fulton
County, GA reveals that her daughter brought in suitcases
of ballots that were counted after observes were told to
leave, corroborating affidavits that flagged 8:22AM as the
time these suitcases arrived.
Freeman said Y all want to know who my new supervisor
is? It s my daughter. She added that I just do what she
say do and it s her show baby, it s her show.

In a November 3 Facebook post, Freeman wrote A lady had
a problem with me telling her what a supervisor told me to tell
her yesterday. This morning, lo and behold, out of nowhere,
she came to give me a hug. You already know the end of that
story. Judas, I m not Jesus. Don t play. I blamed it on Social
distancing.
Freeman s daughter is seen as the first to remove the ballots
from the suitcases and issuing instructions to the other vote
counters, subsequently retrieving a second suitcase of
ballots. Although the lawyers she retained changed her
Instagram into a parody account, that was a last ditch effort to
cover up the truth and is not historically consistent with her
previous posts.

Edison Research was using an unencrypted VPN with login

Publicly available data from
the New York Times reveals
that Biden s lead over Trump
in key battleground states,
such as Michigan and
Wisconsin, were the result of
vote drops that occurred in
the early hours of November
4th and nearly exclusively for
Biden.

Consider the vote update in
Michigan at 3:50AM EST on
November 4th that delivered
54,497 ballots for Biden and
4,718 for Trump. Another even
more anomalous update at
6:31AM EST delivered 141,258
ballots for Biden and 5,968 for
Trump.

Similarly, a vote update at
3:42AM CST on November 4th
in Wisconsin delivered 143,379
to Biden and 25,163 to Trump.
While there are a few
instances where ballot dumps
also went to Trump, these
were in significantly smaller
magnitudes and less frequent.

Four of the seven most
anomalous vote updates
that is, updates in which the
margin and ratio are co
extreme are in election
critical states and occurred
during the same five hour
period where the
circumstances on the ground
were contested and highly
suspicious.
Approximately 15% of the vote
updates in the data set of 8,954
were from Michigan, Wisconsin,
and Georgia. If we were to
assume that any state could
have these extreme vote
updates, then there would be a
1.2% chance that three states
represented in three out of the
top four or four out of the top
seven spots and a 0.99%
chance that these three states
would occupy the five out of the
top seven spots.
If all four of these vote updates
were extreme — but not as
extreme — that the difference in
margin would be greater than
the margin of victory in all three
states. The media s
proclamation of Biden s
ictor in these states relied
on four of the se en most coe treme ote updates in the
entire data set of the hole
8,954 ote updates.

Biden won Fulton County GA by 243,904 votes and 86,309 in absentee ballots.
Even though in 2016, there was less than a percentage point difference in the fraction of absentee ballots
that went to Trump cast in Fulton versus bordering and highly similar neighboring counties, Trump had a 7.19
percentage point lower share in 2020. Results are robust to controlling for demographic differences, such as
race and age.
Biden won Allegheny and Philadelphia Counties by 146,706 and 471,305 votes and 206,505 and 310,553
absentee ballots, respectively.
Just as in Fulton County, GA, Trump s share of votes was 3.4 percentage points lower in Allegheny County in
2020. The differences are even higher when looking at absentee and provisional ballots. Put together, there
are at least 55,270 extra ballots that went to Biden.

If these differences in fraudulent ballots are
incorporated, Trump ould in GA and PA.

ballot records that were changed between the

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy
Boockvar reporting on November 10th (and to

only 10,00 ballots were received after
November 3rd.
In Wisconsin, the number of indefinitely
confined voters surged from under 70,000
voters in 2019 to over 200,000 in 2020.
Social media profiles showed that these
voters actually had active lifestyles. The
130,000 increment is over five times the
margin that Biden won by in the state.
Many states exhibited abnormal turnout rates.
For example, cybersecurity expert Russ
Ramsland testified in Wayne County that 46 of
the 47 precincts where Dominion machines
were used had at least a 96% voter turnout
rate and 25 of the 47 had a 100% turnout.
In Georgia, affidavits and testimonies revealed
that 2,500 felons with uncomplete sentences
registered to vote and cast it, 66,247
underage people were registered to vote and
illegally vote, 2,423 unregistered people
voted, and 10,315 people who voted had died
by the time of the election. Many more
examples abound.

Despite significant opposition and attacks, election security experts were able to audit
Dominion Voter System machines in Antrim County, MI, revealing unusually high error and
adjudication rates.
According to the report, Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully
designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results. The
system intentionally generates an enormously high number of ballot errors. The electronic
ballots are then transferred for adjudication. The intentional errors lead to bulk
adjudication of ballots with no oversight, no transparency, and no audit trail.
Cybersecurity specialists identified an error rate of 68.05 , which is far above the Federal
Election Commission guidelines of 0.0008 .The results of these errors led to tabulation
errors and ballots being sent to adjudication, which means that the vote is decided by the
election worker using the machine (see here . For example, in Central Lake Township, there
were 1,222 out of 1,491 ballots cast that were reversed, producing an 81.96 rejection rate.
Although vote adjudication logs for prior years were available, all the logs for the 2020 cycle
were missing. Moreover, all server security logs prior to 11:03PM on November 4th are
missing. These logs are vital for audit trails, forensics, and detecting malicious intruders.
The Election Event Designer Log shows that Dominion ImageCast Precinct Cards were
programmed with new ballot programming on October 23rd and again on November 5th.
That violates the Help America Vote Act, which includes a 90 day Safe Harbor Period that
prohibits changes to election systems, registries, hardware/software updates without
undergoing re certification.
Even if skeptics and critics win that there are limitations of the aforementioned audit, they
should offer a random sample of machines in other battleground states for third party
review. In contrast, they have viciously attacked attempts to review machine logs and have
even endeavored to wipe the machines in Georgia before the runoff.

Critical Issues with the
2020 Election
A Key Battleground State Synopsis
Version 0.9.1 - Updated January 4, 2020
Background & Abstract
Following the 2016 election, America endured three years of extensive and incessant
investigations, fevered analysis, and, eventually, impeachment hearings – all premised on an
assertion that, somehow, Russia “hacked” the election. The U.S. government spent tens of
millions of dollars. It chased nearly every allegation. It had virtually unlimited (and sometimes
illegal) access to public, government, and private information … and it came up empty handed.
The only place it did not look for the alleged Russian “hack” was in th only systems that could
have been “hacked”: the electronic voting, imaging, and tabulating machines on which the
election was conducted and the software that controls them.
The story of the 2020 election is much the same. Despite thousands of citizen reports and signed
affidavits attesting to significant irregularities and at least one forensic audit of an electronic voting
system claiming that it was – in fact – “hacked”, Secretaries of State around the country have
repeatedly denied citizens their the legal right to observe, contest, and audit the election. A real
“hack” can only be identified by looking at how the voting system operates, starting with the
machines, the software, and the data it generates, including ballots and ballot envelopes, voter
rolls, and adjudication logs, and at those who had access to the systems while they were in
operation.
This brief reviews the last-minute changes to the election process in the contested states and the
magnitude of the resulting fraud the changes were designed to facilitate. It also looks at the status
of the legal challenges where judges have dismissed cases before hearing evidence, and how
both courts and election officials have refused access to the only systems that can be “hacked”:
the electronic voting systems.
It should come as no surprise that a full 47% of the American people believe that electoral fraud
changed the outcome of the 2020 election. They understand that something is amiss.

Questions for the Joint Session of Congress
Congress will meet in a joint session on January 6 to count electoral votes, to consider two primary
objections to the qualifications of the electors certified in seven (7) disputed states, and to hear
the evidence supporting them. The first objection is that the electors in the disputed states were
not “appoint[ed] in such manner as [its] Legislature … direct[ed] ….” , as required by U.S.
Constitution Article II §1. The second is that, because the disputed states did not follow the rules
set by their Legislatures, the vote tallies “certified” by the disputed states are not accurate, and
there is no way to know who won the election.
The first question for the joint session is: “Did State X conduct its election in accordance
with the rules established by its legislature?” If the answer is “Yes”, the electors are qualified
and their votes must be counted. If “No”, none of the electors from that state are qualified.
The second question for the joint session is whether it will hear the mountain of empirical
evidence that shows widespread evidence of electoral fraud and other significant
irregularities, including ballot stuffing and tampering with voting machines and software by both
domestic and foreign actors who had illegal physical and Internet access to the machines.
Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure that the challenged electors were chosen
based upon the faithful execution of the laws made by their state legislatures and in a manner
that respects federal election laws, including the Electors Clause of Article II, the Equal Protection
and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Voting Rights Act.
At a minimum, Congress and the American people are entitled to see and hear the evidence for
themselves, and the legislatures of the disputed states must be able to act to preserve the voting
rights of their citizens. The United States, other democracies, and international organizations
regularly investigate claims that elections in other countries were not fairly conducted. On
December 18, 2020, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Venezuela and a voting
machine company for election fraud. The Organization of American States (OAS) found that many
of the defects claimed in the disputed states were present in the 2019 presidential elections in
Bolivia, and seventeen (17) members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) appointed a team of independent experts to investigate the August 2020 election in
Belarus. The least Congress can do is to investigate voting rights violations at home.

Evidence of “Significant Irregularities” and Fraud
There are four categories of evidence: (a) eye witness testimonies and confessions, (b)
technological evidence that electronic voting machines were attached to insecure networks and
the Internet; (c) electoral fraud and other “significant irregularities”, including votes by dead and
unqualified persons, ballot stuffing, and manual “adjudication” of disputed ballots; and (d)
statistical anomalies in the tabulation data that are recognized by international observers as
indicators of “intentional manipulation” and of “serious irregularities”. We submit that the evidence
in each category is so strong that, when considered together, a compelling case of "outcome
determinative" electoral fraud can be shown by clear and convincing evidence.

What is a “Significant Irregularity”?
A “significant irregularity” is any action that is inconsistent with federal law, or any action that
deviates from the rules for the selection of presidential electors adopted by the state legislature.
●

The Electors Clause, U.S. Constitution, Article II §1:
Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number
of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State
may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an
office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector. (emphasis
added)

●

The Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10101(e), provides that
… the word “vote” includes all action necessary to make a vote effective including, but not
limited to, registration or other action required by State law prerequisite to voting, casting
a ballot, and having such ballot counted and included in the appropriate totals of votes
cast with respect to candidates for public office and propositions for which votes are
received in an election; …

●

The Help America Vote Act [HAVA], 42 U.S.C. §15481(a)(6), provides that
Each State shall adopt uniform and nondiscriminatory standards that define what
constitutes a vote and what will be counted as a vote for each category of voting system
used in the State.

●

The Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10307, also provides that
No person acting under color of law shall fail or refuse to permit any person to vote who
is entitled to vote under any provision of chapters 103 to 107 of this title or is otherwise
qualified to vote, or willfully fail or refuse to tabulate, count, and report such person’s vote.

Summarized below is the definition of “what constitutes a vote and what will be counted as a vote
for each category of voting system used in the State.”

What are “Votes” and How are “Votes” Counted?
1. A “vote” is a ballot, clearly marked by a qualified, registered elector (voter) in accordance
with state laws defining the procedures for voting and the standards for determining the

Attachment: Judy Stit_2020 ELECTION FRAUD EVIDENCE-mobile (COM 137 #2021 : A communication was received from Judy Stitt)

5.16.b

voter’s intent to choose a candidate (or slate). All state laws agree that the intent of the
voter is to be determined by how the voter marks the ballot.
2. A “vote” may be counted only once for a single candidate (or, in the case of a Presidential
election, only once for the entire slate of electors).
a. Voters may vote only once, and each vote must have equal weight. Baker v. Carr,
369 U.S. 186 (1962); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964).
b. No “vote” can be duplicated by mechanical or electronic means, and “votes” are
indivisible. Any tabulating system that produces fractional tallies is not counting
“votes.”
c. “Adjudication” of ballots where the intent of the voter is alleged to be unclear
provides opportunities for state election officials to create or “flip” votes in violation
of the Voting Rights Act and state law.

How are “Votes” Validated and Secured?
State laws require election officials to validate each voter’s qualifications before authorizing the
voter to cast it, including voters who submit absentee or mail ballots. State laws define the
security protocols for an election, and both state and federal election laws obligate state election
officials to certify that they complied with each security protocol, including “sealing” voting
equipment and preserving records for use in election contests.

How do “Significant Irregularities” occur?
“Significant Irregularities” occur when state election officials relax, refuse to enforce, or violate the
ballot integrity and election security rules adopted by their state legislatures. As Texas pointed
out in relation to absentee and mail-in voting in the Supreme Court in State of Texas v.
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, State of Georgia, State of Michigan, State of Wisconsin:
If a state court enjoins or modifies ballot-integrity measures adopted to allow absentee or
mail-in voting, that invalidates ballots cast under the relaxed standard unless the
legislature has—prior to the election—ratified the new procedure. Without pre-election
legislative ratification, results based on the treatment and tabulation of votes done in
violation of state law cannot be used to appoint presidential electors.
The same principle applies to other changes made without legislative approval to the rules
governing elections by state administrators and courts. If the changes impacted ballot integrity
and the election outcome, we cannot know who won the election .

What is Electoral Fraud?
Electoral fraud can be defined as any purposeful action taken to tamper with electoral
activities and election-related materials in order to affect the results of an election,
which may interfere with or thwart the will of the voters. There are two main
categories of electoral fraud: outcome determinative fraud, where the fraud affects the
outcome of the election such that the winners and losers are different from what they would
have been had the fraud not been committed; and non-outcome determinative fraud,
when the outcomes are not affected (i.e. the winners and losers would be the same even
absent the commission of fraud). Both types of electoral fraud entail criminal behavior that
should be punished according to the law; however, outcome determinative fraud has more

positions contrary to the popular will.

Framework, International Foundation for Electoral Systems, White Paper Series (2010)

_paper_web.pdf (accessed December 21, 2020).

Have the Courts rejected the evidence? No.
Many are of the mistaken belief that the evidence has been presented and rejected in the many
state and federal court cases filed and dismissed since November 3. No court has had all the
evidence before it. Nor could it. New evidence is discovered on a daily basis and it is impossible
to audit the electronic systems without first getting access to them.
In most of the cases, the court dismissed the case without considering the evidence or reaching
the legal questions presented. The case filed in the Supreme Court of the United States by the
Texas Attorney General and which was joined by 17 other state Attorneys General and more than
100 Members of the United States House of Representatives was the most prominent example
of a case where the court heard no evidence. In a few others, the attorneys presented only limited
evidence and lost for that reason.

For ballots completely missing signatures, the legislatively- approved procedure was not
to count the ballot, but a last-minute lawsuit changed the procedure and allowed ballots
with missing signatures to be “cured” up to five days later.1
Although Arizona law allows observers to watch over “any significant voting or processing
activities”, the County Recorder for Maricopa County decided that observers would have
no right to observe the signature verification process.2
Multiple officials attempted to include an illegal video call voting process for Maricopa
County, Arizona.3
An additional attempt was made to change Arizona’s voter registration deadline as the
election neared, but it was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.4
Arizona law forbids “ballot harvesting”, but the laws are being challenged and it may have
occurred.5
The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors is resisting a subpoena from the Arizona
Senate demanding audit access to the electronic voting systems.6

22,093 mail-in ballots were “received” the day BEFORE the ballots were sent out to voters.
2,000 voters were “registered” as living on a vacant lot.
150,000 people registered in Maricopa County AFTER the registration deadline.
103,000 ballots in Maricopa County were sent for electronic "adjudication" with no
Republican observation, meaning that poll workers had the opportunity to switch Trump
votes to Biden or "vote" ballots where the elector's choice was not clear.
36,400 illegal immigrants are estimated to have voted.
50% of Republicans had requested ballots that were never subsequently recorded as
having been “received” or “counted” by the state.
42,000 "Biden-only" votes were cast, meaning that the voter voted for no other candidate
or issue. This huge statistical anomaly is a recognized indicator of electoral fraud.

Court Cases
Bowyer v. Ducey (Trial court: 2:20-cv-02321-DJH; Appeals Court: ; U.S. Supreme Court: 20-858)
Summary: Lawyer Sidney Powell filed a federal lawsuit on Dec. 2 seeking to de-certify and
invalidate improper votes in Arizona over election fraud, and to order officials to preserve
equipment and voting data for inspection. The suit alleges that over 412,000 votes were cast
illegally in the state. Most of the plaintiffs are Republican presidential electors in the state and
members of the Republican party in the state.
Dec. 6: Judge rejects request for a three-hour hearing to hear witnesses and limits hearing to
motion to dismiss, and dismisses case on Dec. 9 without hearing a single shred of evidence.
Dec. 11: Powell’s team files an emergency petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Kelli Ward filed a petition on Nov. 24 for early inspection
of mail-in ballot envelopes and signatures, ahead of an anticipated elections contest against 11
Arizona Democrat presidential electors. Ward’s challenge alleges that some suburbs in Maricopa
County had an unusually high number of duplicated ballots. It also claims that there were
insufficient safeguards to verify mail-in ballots.
Dec. 4: After two days of hearings, an Arizona judge denies relief for the plaintiff (pdf), ruling that
the evidence did not show fraud or misconduct. The judge also found that there was a low error
rate and that it would not impact the outcome of the election. Ward has indicated that she would
appeal the case to the state Supreme Court.
Dec. 7: Arizona Supreme Court granted a request to expeditiously review the ruling.
Dec. 8: Arizona Supreme Court denies Ward’s request for relief and upholds trial judge’s decision.

Conclusion: “Outcome determinative electoral fraud”
Disqualifying completed ballots received before election officials sent them out to voters would be
sufficient to overcome the current 12,000 vote margin. Adding in the other balloting illegalities,
like the ballots adjudicated without a Republican observer and ballots received after the deadline
for registrations represents thirty times the margin necessary to change the outcome. In
combination with the massive influx of mail-in ballots, the last minute changes to rules had an
extensive impact on the ability of the poll watchers to observe and challenge possible irregularities
such as allowing invalid ballots to be “cured” without challenge long after the day of the election.

Georgia
(12,670 margin vs. over 530,000 contested ballots)

Actions and last-minute illegal rule changes
●

●

●

Georgia’s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, without legislative approval, unilaterally
abrogated Georgia’s statute governing the signature verification process for absentee
ballots.
Although state law prohibits the opening of absentee ballots until after the polls open on
Election Day, the State Election board adopted a rule allowing the processing of absentee
ballots three weeks prior to the election
Georgia law [O.C.G.A. § 21-2-386(a)(l)(C)] authorizes and requires a single registrar or
clerk—after reviewing the outer envelope—to reject an absentee ballot--if there is any
issue regarding the signature. The State Election Board, however, unilaterally changed
the rules to make it much more difficult to reject a signature.

“Significant Irregularities” Suggesting Fraud
●

●

●

After examining evidence of extensive abnormalities, the Chairman’s Report of the
Election Law Study Subcommittee of the Standing Senate Judiciary Committee (Georgia)
reported that overall “there was a lack of enforcement of the law.”
“Proper protocols were not used to ensure chain of custody of the ballots throughout the
Election, after the opening of ballots prior to the Election, and during the recounts. . . . It
was possible or even likely that large numbers of fraudulent ballots were introduced into
the pool of ballots that were counted as voted; . . . The Subcommittee heard testimony of
pristine ballots whose origin looked suspicious or which could not be verified and the
inability of poll workers to distinguish between test ballots and absentee ballots.
Signatures were not consistently verified according to law in the absentee balloting
process.”
Coffee County could not replicate its ballot tallies after re-running them repeatedly,
preventing them from being able to certify their 15,000 votes. As county election officials
reported, “The basis for the dilemma is simple - the election summary report for the
electronic recount tabulated votes in a manner that resulted in more collective votes being

2,560 felons with non completed sentences were illegally registered and cast their vote.
66,247 underage people were illegally registered to vote.
4,926 registered voters were registered to vote in another state after their Georgia
registration date.
10,315 people who voted died by the time of the election.
305,701 absentee ballots were applied for too early and 2,664 absentee ballots were sent
to voters too early.
Georgia has historically had a 2.9% rejection rate for absentee ballots because of errors
in their submission. In 2020, the rejection rate was only 0.34% (seventeen times less)
despite a sixfold increase in the number of absentee ballots returned.
50% of Republicans had requested absentee ballots that were never subsequently
recorded as having been “received” or “counted” by the state.
Between 31,559 and 38,886 mail-in (absentee) ballots were mailed in but not counted.9
Matt Braynard found 17,877 early or absentee ballots that were cast in Georgia in the

Conclusion: “Outcome Determinative Electoral Fraud”
Just amending the absentee rejection rates to be normal would be sufficient to overturn the
election result. If the rejection rate of mailed-in absentee ballots remained the same in 2020 as it
was in 2016, there would be 83,517 less tabulated ballots in 2020. The statewide split of absentee
ballots was 34.68% for Trump and 65.2% for Biden. Rejecting at the higher 2016 rate with the
2020 split between Trump and Biden would decrease Trump votes by 28,965 and Biden votes by
54,552, which would be a net gain for Trump of 25,587 votes. This would be more than needed
to overcome the Biden advantage of 12,670 votes, and Trump would win by 12,917 votes.

Michigan’s Secretary of State, Jocelyn Benson, without legislative approval, unilaterally
abrogated Michigan election statutes related to absentee ballot applications and signature
verification.
Secretary Benson announced that her office would send unsolicited absentee-voter ballot
applications by mail to all 7.7 million registered Michigan voters prior to the primary and
general elections despite the law requiring a written signed request from the voter or a
specific absent voter ballot application from the city clerk or a federal postcard application.
Secretary Benson also violated Michigan law when she launched a program in June 2020
allowing absentee ballots to be requested online, without signature verification as
expressly required under Michigan law.
Michigan also requires that poll watchers and inspectors have access to vote counting

Secretary Benson’s unconstitutional modifications of Michigan’s election rules resulted in
the distribution of millions of absentee ballot applications without verifying voter signatures
as required by law. “While I was at the TCF Center, I was instructed not to look at any of
the signatures on the absentee ballots, and I was instructed not to compare the signature
on the absentee ballot with the signature on file.”12
Due to unconstitutional changes to Michigan’s election law, the Wayne County Statement
of Votes Report lists 174,384 absentee ballots out of 566,694 absentee ballots tabulated
(about 30.8%) as counted without a registration number for precincts in the City of Detroit.
Large discrepancies exist between the Qualified Voter File (Absentee Voter Module) and
2020 Presidential Election results in Wayne County, potentially disqualifying 204,000

place through a “troubling, insidious, and egregious ploy ” of ballot stuffing, which gave
Democratic nominee Joe Biden a lead in the state. The fraud allegedly was rendered invisible
through the help of using election software and hardware from Dominion Voting Systems, the
lawsuit claims. Plaintiffs in the civil action are six registered Michigan voters and nominees of the

Eyewitness Affidavits
Several Michigan residents have signed affidavits, which were sworn under penalty of perjury,
alleging they witnessed widespread election tampering in Detroit involving many thousands of
ballots. City of Detroit employee Jessy Jacob stated in an affidavit that she was instructed to
backdate thousands of absentee ballots on Nov. 4 to make them appear legal even though
they were not in the Qualified Voter File (QVF) and had not arrived by the deadline.
Robert Cushman, another poll observer in Detroit, submitted an affidavit that described behavior
similar to what Jacob said she witnessed. Cushman said he saw large swaths of ballots being
counted the day after the election for voters who were not in the authorized list of names.
In some cases, he added, fake birth dates were being used to fill in birth dates.
Alexandra Seely, a Michigan voter who worked as a Republican poll challenger, said in an affidavit
that her challenges to suspect ballots were ignored and she was “harassed and
threatened” for raising concerns. “I challenged 10 votes at table 23, they would not take out the
log to record my challenges,” Seely’s affidavit says. “I had to write names and ballot numbers on
my own. I asked to make incident reports. They would not allow me, and said they would make a
note in the computer. They did not and proceeded to keep counting.”
[Former MI state senator] Patrick Colbeck, a poll watcher at the TCF Center in Detroit, said in an
affidavit that he observed an active Internet connection on the screens of the computers
used to tabulate and adjudicate ballots at the absentee-vote counting center.

Conclusion: “Outcome Determinative Electoral Fraud”
These non-legislative modifications to Michigan’s election statutes fostered an environment in
which electoral fraud and other “significant irregularities” were almost guaranteed. Not only do
these changes violate the Electors Clause, the number of illegal ballots counted as “votes” far
exceeds the margin of voters separating the candidates in Michigan.

Actions and last-minute illegal rule changes

Previously, Nevada had implemented safeguards to protect free and honest elections,
however, on August 2, 2020, the Nevada legislature passed AB4. “The law requires the
state of Nevada to mail every voter a ballot and even allows ballots cast after election day
to count. It also allows other people to sign and return ballots on behalf of voters over
65.”18
This massive change overturned a ballot harvesting ban and allowed a total stranger to
pick up a ballot for anyone, opening the door to potentially widespread fraud.

In Nevada, the 2020 rejection rate of mail-in-ballots was approximately 0.75%, less than
half the 1.6% rate from 2016.
Signature verification in Clark County had an unbelievable 89% fail rate.19
42,284 people are on record as having voted twice in 2020.
20,000 ballots were cast in the names of individuals without a Nevada mailing address.
2,468 ballots were cast by people who had moved to another state and thus were ineligible
to vote in Nevada.
1,500 ballots were cast by dead people.
Almost 4,000 non-citizens voted.
Nearly 30,000 people voted who falsely listed non-residential, vacant, or non-existent
addresses as their home addresses.
Matt Braynard found 5,145 early or absentee ballots that were cast in Nevada in the names
of people who had filed out-of-state move notices and thus were not eligible to vote in
Nevada.

Court Cases
Trump attorney Jesse Binnall wanted to audit the machines in Nevada but the court there wouldn't
allow it. He had two whistleblowers,one said that when they logged out of the machine with USB
drives, there would be one number of votes, but when they logged back in the next morning there
would be a different number. The witnesses said votes were just disappearing. Binnall requested
a full audit of the machines, explaining that it is extremely important to get full transparency with
media narrative being, "Oh, the machines are fine. Oh, the machines are secure.” This is simply
a "Trust us!" narrative. Once we've seen what's happening in Michigan, and now for instance

actually have a full audit of these machines, you just have to say, "what have they got to hide?”
Binnall confirmed that in Nevada the courts didn't really look at the evidence, and many
cases
have
been
thrown
out
on
technicalities
or
on
"standing."
Jesse Binnall: “It’s really, really unfortunate that courts are trying to find ways to dodge the issue.
My case in Nevada is an example of that, where we were told: no live witnesses and you’re limited
to only 15 depositions. So 130,000 instances of voter fraud, and you can only do it with 15
depositions. But we’re also going to limit your ability to get subpoenas and force people to show
up. And over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, we were really limited for how we could actually
put in our evidence, and so for instance, when we’re able to find evidence of almost 4,000
noncitizens who voted in the election, the court wouldn’t even hear that evidence, the court
excluded it completely. And then when it went up to the Supreme Court in Nevada, they gave us
two hours to brief our case, to brief all of our issues….8,000 pages of evidence, they gave us
two hours to brief it. And we still in just over two hours, we put together a 40-page brief that
walked them through all the important issues. And they paid so much attention to that 40-page
brief and 8,000 pages of documents that they summarily affirmed the case a couple of hours after
that. It’s just completely ridiculous that courts are more interested in being a rubber stamp for this
media narrative that there was no voter fraud and ignoring the evidence to the contrary, that there
was clear voter fraud, that courts have decided to abdicate their role to be neutral arbiters. That’s
really sad.”

Nevada who pledged to President Donald Trump filed an election contest on Nov. 17, alleging
irregularities, improprieties, and fraud in the state’s 2020 presidential election. The contest, filed
in the First Judicial District Court in Carson City, seeks to have Trump declared as the winner in
Nevada, or to have the election annulled. The plaintiffs allege that the election machines used
throughout the state are unreliable, that observers were denied access to the ballot duplication
process, and that alleged vote-buying occurred through some Native American outreach
programs.

“significant irregularities” in established voting procedures, and set the stage for widespread
failure to enforce state and federal laws that guarantee election integrity.
Jesse Binnall, in testimony before the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and

New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver violated the state election code
by permitting voters to deposit completed absentee ballots in drop boxes at voting
locations rather than handing them to the location's presiding judge in person.
Drop boxes were installed around the state this fall with federal funding from the CARES
Act in an effort to reduce numbers of voters congregating at voting locations in the midst
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Republican Party of New Mexico sued over the state's use of drop boxes in October,
demanding video monitoring for all drop boxes and accusing two county clerks of lax
security measures. The party withdrew its complaint after Toulouse Oliver's office
reiterated previously issued guidance to county clerks on their use.

The results for the presidential race from the state website count Biden/Harris 501,614
and Trump/Pence 401,894.21
Since the drop boxes represented a significant portion of the overall ballots, this potentially

Some counties had suspiciously high voter registration rates of around 100%, including
one with a voter registration rate of 109% and another of 177%.22
In comparison to the results in 2016, Biden’s totals were 130% greater than Hillary Clinton,
who won New Mexico 385,234 to 319,667 for Trump, and Trump in 2020 exceeded his
2016 totals 125.7% - yet he allegedly lost.

in the Election Code, and the only creature of statute that looks in any way like it is the “secured
container” concept from § 1-6-9(E), but the Secretary took the position that drop boxes were not
“secured containers.” Rather, the Secretary took the position that drop boxes were simply an
embodiment of the longstanding rule that an absentee-ballot “official mailing envelope may be
returned in person to . . . an alternate voting location, mobile alternate voting location or election
day voting location.” NMSA 1978, § 1-6-9(D). In short, her position is that there is no difference
between the longstanding practice of a voter turning in his or her ballot “in person” and a voter
turning in to a drop box placed outside the polling place.
[…]
This procedure was simply not followed with regard to what the Trump Campaign believes was
the majority of drop boxes in New Mexico, allowing individuals to drop off multiple ballots —
meaning that, by definition, they were not the voter on all of them — without speaking to a person

Last-minute and Illegitimate Rule Changes
●

●
●

●

●

●

●

Pennsylvania’s Secretary of State, Kathy Boockvar, without legislative approval or
ratification, unilaterally abrogated several Pennsylvania statutes requiring signature
verification for absentee or mail-in ballots.
The Pennsylvania Department of State’s guidance unconstitutionally did away with
Pennsylvania’s statutory signature verification requirements.
The governor approved, contravening state law, a last minute ballot deadline change
allowing ballots to be accepted after election day.23
A further last-minute change allowed ballots to be accepted without postmarks24
Pennsylvania’s election law also requires that poll-watchers be granted access to the
opening, counting, and recording of absentee ballots. Local election officials in
Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties decided not to follow 25 PA. STAT. § 3146.8(b) for
the opening, counting, and recording of absentee and mail-in ballots.
Prior to the election, Secretary Boockvar sent an email to local election officials urging
them to provide opportunities for various persons—including political parties—to contact
voters to “cure” defective mail-in ballots. This process clearly violated several provisions
of the state election code.
Through removing the ballots for examination prior to seven o’clock a.m. on election day,
Secretary Boockvar created a system whereby local officials could review ballots without
the proper announcements, observation, and security.
A great number of ballots were received after the statutory deadline and yet were counted
by virtue of the fact that Pennsylvania did not segregate all ballots received after 8:00 pm
on November 3, 2020 as required by order of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.

Gregory Stenstrom, a Navy veteran and forensic computer scientist, testified Wednesday
before the State Senate Majority Policy Committee hearing in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, about
an election process in Delaware County he described as being “forensically destructive.”
“In all cases the chain of custody was broken,” the GOP poll watcher said. “It was broken
for the mail in ballots, the drop box ballots, the election day USB card flash drives." Not
one procedure defined by the Delaware County Board of Elections and Election Process Review
was followed, he added. Stenstrom said he, along with Democratic poll watchers, witnessed a
person described as “not a part of the process” come in with bags of USB cards, uploading
them into machines. "I personally observed USB cards being uploaded to voting machines by
the voting machine warehouse supervisor on multiple occasions. I saw this personally. I brought
it to the attention of the deputy sheriff who was there stationed, who was a senior law enforcement
officer, and I brought to the attention of the clerk of elections," he said. "I brought it to their
attention. I objected, and I said this person is not being observed," he continued. "He’s not
part of the process that I can see, and he’s walking in with baggies — which we have
pictures of and it was submitted in our affidavits — and he was sticking these USBs into
the machines. "So I personally witnessed that happen over 24 times. We have multiple other
witnesses who saw it, including Democrat poll watchers. As of today, 47 USB cards are missing,
and they are nowhere to be found,” added Stenstrom. “I was told personally that these 24 to 30
cards that were uploaded weren’t there.” Stenstrom also said he was assured that there were
between 10-20 GOP poll watchers at the counting center but he wanted to go see for himself. He
was required to wait five hours before being allowed in.36

in violation of State law, and the fact that voters from Democrat heavy counties were allowed to
“cure” their ballots while most of those from heavily Republican counties were not given that
option, a clear violation of Equal Protection, the election in Pennsylvania is not only open to
question, but the alleged results as a matter of law simply cannot be legally certified. These nonlegislative modifications to Pennsylvania’s election rules appear to have generated an outcomedeterminative number of unlawful ballots that were cast in Pennsylvania.
The conclusion that the fraud was “outcome determinative” is supported also by totaling the
118,426 ballots counted that could not have been “received” before they were mailed or that were
“received” the day after they were mailed. Given the slow service of the U.S. Mail, these outcomes
are physically impossible, and the numbers “certified” are demonstrably false.

Actions and last-minute illegal rule changes
●

●

●

●

Wisconsin Elections Commission undertook a campaign to position hundreds of drop
boxes to collect absentee ballots—including the use of unmanned drop boxes, despite
specific statutes requiring “that the privilege of voting by absentee ballot must be carefully
regulated to prevent the potential for fraud or abuse.”
The mayors of Wisconsin’s five largest cities—Green Bay, Kenosha, Madison, Milwaukee,
and Racine, which all have Democrat majorities— joined in this effort, and together,
developed a plan use purportedly “secure drop-boxes to facilitate return of absentee
ballots.”37
However, the use of any drop box, manned or unmanned, is directly prohibited by
Wisconsin statute, and any alternate absentee ballot site “shall be staffed by the municipal
clerk or the executive director of the board of election commissioners, or employees of the
clerk or the board of election commissioners.”38
Specifically, registering to vote by absentee ballot requires photo identification, except for
those who register as “indefinitely confined” or “hospitalized.” However, WEC and local
election officials also took it upon themselves to encourage voters to unlawfully declare
themselves “indefinitely confined”—which under Wisconsin law allows the voter to avoid
security measures like signature verification and photo ID requirements.
Under Wisconsin law, voting by absentee ballot also requires voters to complete a
certification, including their address, and have the envelope witnessed by an adult who
also must sign and indicate their address on the envelope. However, in a training video
issued April 1, 2020, the Administrator of the City of Milwaukee Elections Commission
unilaterally declared that a “witness address may be written in red and that is because we
were able to locate the witnesses’ address for the voter” to add an address missing from
the certifications on absentee ballots. This is a clear violation of the law.39 Additionally,
statute clearly states that ““If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot
may not be counted.”

Clerks failed to enter initials on ballot envelopes indicating whether the elector is exempt
from providing proof of identification, as required by Wis. Stat. §136.87 (2).
Clerks and the boards of canvassers permitted absentee ballots returned without the
required witness address under Wis. Stat. § 6.87 (2) to be counted in contravention of
Wis. Stat. § 6.87 (6d).
Clerks who received absentee ballots with improperly completed certificates or no
certificates filled in missing information in contravention of Wis. Stat. § 6.87 (9).
The clerk of the City of Madison ignored Wis. Stat. § 6.855 and created an event named
“Democracy in the Park” and, of her own accord, designated alternate sites where
absentee ballots could be collected; these ballots were counted in contravention of Wis.
Stat. § 6.87 (6).40
It is alleged in an action recently filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Wisconsin that over five hundred unmanned, illegal, absentee ballot drop boxes
were used in the Presidential election in Wisconsin.41
While the Secretary of State tried to use the pandemic to classify more people as
indefinitely confined, the WI Supreme Court struck this down. Ignoring this court ruling,
the Wisconsin Secretary of State convinced over 215,000 to claim the status anyway
under Wis. Stat. § 6.86 (2), causing chaos and confusion, and failed to keep current the
mailing list established under that subsection and clerks in Dane and Milwaukee counties
offered illegal advice that encouraged individuals to use indefinite confinement as a way
to ignore the state’s photo I.D. requirement.42 43 The usual number of indefinitely confined
voters in Wisconsin is 20,000.
Thousands of “indefinitely confined” voters have been identified on Facebook with pictures
that point towards clearly active lifestyles.
Ethan J. Pease, a box truck delivery driver subcontracted to the U.S. Postal Service
(“USPS”) to deliver truckloads of mail-in ballots to the sorting center in Madison, WI,
testified that a senior USPS employee told him on November 4, 2020 that “[a]n order came
down from the Wisconsin/Illinois Chapter of the Postal Service that 100,000 ballots were
missing” and needing to be “found”. He filed a sworn statement that the USPS in actuality
gathered approximately 100,00 late ballots and backdated them in an attempt to count
them. 100,000 ballots supposedly “found” after election day would far exceed former Vice
President Biden's margin of 20,565 votes over President Trump.
20% of Republicans had requested ballots that were never subsequently recorded as
having been “received” or “counted” by the state.
63,000 Biden only votes (huge statistical anomaly), despite Trump’s recent recognition as
America’s most popular man, 3x more popular than Biden.
Mathematically incongruous Wisconsin update listed as 3:42AM Central Time on
November 4th, 2020, which shows 143,379 votes for Joe Biden and 25,163 votes for
Donald Trump. This starkly contrasts normal voting patterns in this area.44

Conclusion
These non-legislative modifications to Wisconsin’s election rules appear to have generated an
outcome-determinative number of unlawful ballots that were cast in Wisconsin. The supposedly
“found” ballots and the approximately 200,000 illegally claimed as “indefinitely confined”
individually and together far exceed Vice President Biden's alleged margin of 20,565 votes over
President Trump. Regardless of the number of such ballots, the non legislative changes to the
election rules violated the Electors Clause.

Conclusion for all seven states with contested
electoral slates (415,000 margin vs. over 2,200,000 ballots contested)
There is now a mountain of empirical evidence that voter fraud was present in the 2020 election
and intentionally concentrated in specific counties of specific swing states. Ranging from eye
witness testimony to statistical anomalies to significant machine vulnerabilities that were exploited
by foreign adversaries, roughly 2.2 million votes are contested. With a margin between the
candidates of less than 415 thousand votes across all contested states, this represents more than
five times the votes needed to sway the election outcome of all battleground states in favor of
President Trump.
Even if some of these pieces of evidence were possible to somehow explain away or leave a bit
of reasonable doubt, there is no way to explain all of them away simultaneously. Indeed,
sophisticated statistical analysis points out that the anomalous behavior in Michigan, Georgia,
and Wisconsin alone between 1:30 and 6:32AM EST November 4th has a probability of
0.00229%, which is effectively zero.46 In brief, it is the duty of state and national legislators to
consider the evidence and maintain election integrity for not only 2020, but all future generations
in the United States and all countries that model off of our democracy. State legislators have a
duty to ensure that their election law was faithfully followed and to ensure that their authority to
set the rules under which elections take place, upon which rules the certification of electors
depends, is unchallenged. National legislators have a responsibility to act as national poll
watchers, as it were, and to be the ultimate guarantors that the state laws were faithfully followed
and that the Electoral votes opened in their presence are legal votes. In the face of clear and
widespread evidence that that is not the case, and that the Electors from certain states were NOT
legally certified, they have a responsibility to not count those illegal votes and be the final
guarantors of election integrity.

Brennan briefed the group on how to manipulate people to embrace new tech electronic
voting machines, by pushing anonymity after the localizer identified key issues and dynamics.
The project was called Project Reins. No one told me this was classified information nor was
anything ever marked classified.
In 2008, Obama and McCain fixed the election. McCain knew he was going to lose from
this manipulation. It was fixed. I was overseeing some of the operations especially those
concerning Charles Black. The Obama and McCain race was fixed to test if the technology and
strategy by McCain could compete with social media outlets. They had already pre-planned who
would win. Robert Bauer had drafted the legal framework for it - dependent on GSG (Brennan)
to deliver with social media, which was the proof of concept. Dennis Blair was also briefed and
assured the success of the project by helping to deploy the Shadownet.
Dynology helped McCain collect data and deploy to compare/contrast and compile data
compared to that and merge that of the Obama campaign. The RNC was in on it via McCain,
hence Dynology had access to the RNC and the McCain campaign.
The purpose was to fine tune the predictive analytics, coupled with all the data they were
able to collect through various FBI contracts. Robert Cuthbertson was able to obtain and secure
such data for both the CIA and the FBI.
McCain's purpose was to hide metric data collection that he would feed to the Obama
campaign as well as to set a precedent for the acce a ce f e l .

In 2011, preliminary to 2012 election, I provided a Georgia address in writing Patrick
Byrne and Joe Flynn which was the location where the cycle testing of the machines was done,
but also testing latency between script push and reporting to ensure that live updates did not
capture vote block allocations that were needed to ensure efficiency of algorithm , battery
life, latency, ballot counters, optical scanners, and digital slate. None of this information was
marked classified at any time. Romney knew he was going to lose. A foreign-entity created code
and algorithm built by a Soros-owned company (Smartmatic/Smart Cities/SOE software) was
then fine-tuned by China via a French contractor Safran which also subcontracts to Papillon AO
which is GRU link.
I have personal knowledge that General Hayden was the running point for Brennan.
Brennan was supposed to come through with fixing the election and pushing the election
software before being appointed. It was the deal . I was operating under the supervision of the
President, the CIA director, the head of election crimes of the DOJ (Pilgur) and others. At that
time they had already planned to remove and box Robert Gates who wanted more skin - and
refused to relinquish pooled control. Gates was removed and replaced by Panetta. Panetta was
moved to ensure that the Department of Defense would ignore that products of foreign defense
deployed on US soil as t l f elec i

to prearrange the loss (but hoped the mission would fail to solidify). Brennan reassured Obama

planned in 2011 when Ambassador Stevens first arrived in Libya via Greece. I have personal
knowledge of that operation and how Morell was working with the UN to orchestrate it.
Morell was a point of contact (POC) that HRC brought in to buffer the intelligence
community concerns that the UN had with timing on the deployment of the North American

President Trump successfully won fairly. I observed that no script deployments or stalls
occurred in 2016. This was because physical mitigation was in place since Owen used the same
location of deployment. Network and power were disrupted during the tally which disallowed
them access remotely to the election machines. I have personal knowledge of the physical
actions taken to ensure disruption of their communications.
It is considered that mitigation may had been in place by another group to assist in
hindering deployment on the DHS side which is not confirmed by personal knowledge, but the
Secretary of State of Georgia alleged in 2016 that the elections were compromised because they
detected a hacker. It turned out it wasn t Russians. The hacker was determined to be DHS (a
DHS IP address).
The Cipher key for trapdoor was always in the hand of DHS/IC persons that Brennan had

No block adjustment was done during the window of the 2016 election. In 2016, Georgia

that the DHS IP that was discovered was a non-attribution method used to mitigate physical
disruptions of cipher key deployment that had previously failed - therefore I am certain that the

election network in Georgia) was there.

If you find the IP and the device that the DHS hacked within the Georgia elections to
R ia
you can find the current actor of such actions.
CONSIDERATIONS:

I have personal knowledge that Richard Pilgur, the head of election crimes at the
department of justice (DOJ) at that time, had been briefed of the software deployment in 2012 2020. He a al b iefed

Be a
e a i . Pilg knew the elections were fixed. He was on the call in the Fall of 2012
discussing mitigation achieved or on-ready.
KEY POINTS
Cipher key holders are within the agency and Cyber Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA). No Block Allocation in 2016 was observed.
Observations
The 2020 elections seem to have stalled all election machines at the same time, as Cipher
Key must have originated from one point and pinged off each state. This infers that the Master
Key was used for block allocation and that the operation may have stalled counting to
communicate with on-the-ground persons to help advise physical mitigations to be deployed in
case of an audit; i.e., was Block Allocation of 100K votes adjusted by script?
The plan of mitigation, if the algorithm fails, due to overwhelming contrary votes, and
the algorithm self-adjusts to block allocate the votes needed to ensure the predetermined results,
is to call Point of Contact (POC) in p lli g l ca i
ha ha e
l e
a ch . It is then
advised to divv he a
f h ical e ide ce ha ill be eeded to cover the
predetermined vote fix once elections are certified, in case of audit. They are instructed to create
physical evidence then to resume counting. This is why the creation of physical ballots is found.
Call logs of individuals at locations will confirm this information. That is how we
monitored those mitigating for us outside the continental United States (OCONUS).

Brennan used federal taxpayer money to help contract out the fine tuning of core software
upon which all election machines run. This is not a Dominion Software issue only, as both CCP
(Chinese Communist Parties) and Pakistani ISI (Islamic Security Intelligence) professionals were
involved.
When I arrived approximately 12 days ago, I asked for a collection of routers from noncontested states in order to SIP and locate the IP access point. All 50 states and territories all

I, Scott Bennett, do hereby make this declaration and affirm in good faith, to the best of my ability and
recollection, that it is accurate and truthful, so help me God.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The AFL-CIO union (specifically its leadership and international partners) is currently undergoing an
operation against POTUS. This operation was planned and disseminated three months before the
Presidential 2020 election to undermine President Trump and elect Joe Biden as President of the United
States in 2020. See Exhibit 1 (AFL-CIO document 5-phase plan).
This plan was discovered by Scott Bennett, and two individuals working within the union who are proTrump. Scott Bennett is a former U.S. Army Psychological Operations Officer and State Department
Counterterrorism contractor, and Bush Administration Official. Bennett has created multidimensional
psyop products against Chinese Communist actors (See Exhibit 3 e ample of Benne

has also lectured at universities and on international media channels on these subjects, including in Iran
and Russia. Bennett is one of the best back-channel persons for any diplomatic engagements with Iran
or Russia. See Exhibit 3 (portfolio of Bennett work).
Worker A and Worker B are contractors and members of the AFL-CIO, with Worker B being a high level
officer in the leadership circle of AFL-CIO. Worker A and Worker B have adamantly expressed their
indefatigable conviction that this material is extremely sensitive and should not be released to the
public, for safety reasons, and that they prefer in person debriefings in order to avoid potential
disclosure or electronic tracings back to them. Worker A and Worker B should be considered
whistleblowers and given full protection, and also considered intelligence gathering assets for future
assignments.

BACKGROUND ON AFL-CIO OPERATION:
Scott Bennett and these two union worker individuals obtained the AFL-CIO strategic plan in
PDF/powerpoint format. It describes a detailed five (5) phase plan to collaborate with leftist
organizations to elect Joe Biden for President using various means, some of which may be criminal in
nature. The timeline (See Exhibit 1) of this plan is stated on the document and reads as follows:

SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION ABOUT AFL-CIO DOCUMENTATION AND WHISTLEBLOWERS

Packet Pg. 256

Some of the AFL-CIO and its affiliates, et al, activities and methodologies involved may constitute
criminal violations of federal law and ethical guidelines.
The names and identities and locations of these two individuals and their families must remain strictly
confidential for their protection, as they fear for their lives, and their families. They believe they would
be in immediate danger if they were exposed for the work they have been doing with Scott Bennett.
Henceforth, these two individuals will be referred to as simply Worker A and Worker B in this report,
and should, along with Scott Bennett, be given full whistleblower and other immunity and pardon for all
work and information provided. Acceptance of this Declaration constitutes acceptance of these terms
and conditions. Scott Bennett is the only person they will trust.
OVERVIEW:
Scott Bennett targeted, met and acquired Worker A and Worker B after researching leftist groups and
Democratic organizations collaborating and conspiring against President Donald J. Trump. These
include, but are not limited to, Liberation Road, Sunrise, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Geo ge So o Open
Society Foundation and related sub-groups, and the AFL-CIO, and Postal Workers Union. This
methodology should be kept strictly confidential and not shared with anyone, including Worker A and
Worker B, in order to preserve trust with them personally; and not compromise other current
intelligence gathering operations.
Worker A and Worker B expressed interest to Bennett in developing pro-Trump Truck rallies and other
activities and networks for Donald Trump by uniting their fellow workers within the AFL-CIO and related
sub-unions in the California Bay Area and in other areas of the United States. See Exhibit 2 (photos).
Bennett met and discussed the goals, objectives, strategies, and tactics of such a program, and the
participants. Worker A and Worker B agreed with Bennett and recruited their fellow workers and held
large rallies and activities in the Sacramento, Fresno, San Francisco areas of California for President
Donald Trump he e Benne
a p e en ed a he Ma e of Ce emonie Speake o add e he
crowds of participants and direct communications in some of these events. See Exhibits 2. Bennett
worked with other individuals on this, who will remain safely anonymous in this report, but can testify if
required later.
After speaking at several successful rally activities and securing the trust and confidence of Worker A
and Worker B, they then expressed to Scott Bennett their interest in expanding their role and providing
additional materials relating to AFL-CIO union activities and materials that could be helpful to President
Trump. Bennett agreed and discussed potential applications. Soon after Worker A and Worker B
provided Bennett with a AFL-CIO strategic plan that was authored by George Soros affiliated attorneys
and high level union leaders. Worker A and Worker B can authenticate this document and all persons
related to its creation, dissemination, implementation, and follow-up operations and plans.
This document had been secretly shared with ten (10) high level AFL-CIO leaders in September 2020,
and provided details about how to disrupt the Trump campaign in five (5) phases, and the calendar of
significant events and markers that would occur as the election cycle occurred, ballots were cast,
counted, certified, and other possible scenarios and contingencies. The document outlined strategic
communications that should be employed to the mainstream media and through all left-wing groups in

that Joe Biden won the election. Keep in mind, this document was released more than two (2) months
before the election. See Exhibit 1 (AFL-CIO slide show PDF). Bennett was informed that the document
had acing ma k and po embedded in the document in order to identify the regions the
documents were released into, in case they were leaked. This way they could be traced to the union
offices from where they came, and identify the whistleblowers. Therefore, it is crucial that this
document remains strictly confidential and is not released to the media at this time. Worker A and
Wo ke B ha e e p e ed o Sco Benne
We are already getting calls from the Union questioning
the release of this document and who did i

After gaining the trust of Worker A and Worker B, and meeting in person, Bennett assured them that
their safety could be preserved, and their anonymity. Bennett also stressed the urgency of their
a i ance d e o he co p ha Democ a
e e planning and he de
c ion of American industry
through Democrat policies. Bennett articulated the pro-American industry philosophy and policies of
Presiden T mp and hi de i e o Make Ame ica G ea b e ning adi ional bl e colla job back

Worker A and Worker B then discussed with Scott Bennett their illingne o be in ide o mole
within the AFL-CIO union who could obtain other materials, communications, and inside information
from the internal operations of the union and their members and leadership. The workers then
expressed a desire to help President Trump utilize and benefit from this information, and play a larger
ole in flipping Califo nia and defea ing he lef i -Democrat stranglehold on American workers and
blue-collar industry.
For the purposes of brevity and urgency, Bennett will defer inclusion of this an additional info and
include in another addendum to this report.
All material and exhibits contained in this Declaration are true and accurate to the best of my ability,
knowledge, and recollection. Acceptance of this declaration constitutes acceptance of all materials and
exhibits and all terms and conditions stipulated.

I, Scott Bennet, on oath and subject to the laws of perjury, being over 18 years of age and legally
competent to testify to the matters set forth herein, now declare as follows that the following is

ELECTION 2020: THE GREAT DECEPTION
This is a war, we must put ourselves in that frame of mind, and fight it with fearlessness,
determination, and resolve.
SUMMARY:
Human intelligence assets have disclosed evidence, testimony, and information disclosing a
detailed plan about UBS-CCP-Dominion election machines conspiring to engage in a coup
against the United States and removal of President Trump through voting fraud that also
apparently involves a AFL-CIO ground army of BLM-antifa-sunrise movements, and federal

KEY FINDINGS:
Human intelligence assets indicate Vice President of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Wang
Qishan was behind the $400 million investment into Dominion. Intelligence is reporting that
Wang founded UBS securities with Wen Jiabao, who was the former VP of China.
CAVEAT: It could be a trap set up by the deep State of CCP Jiang Zemin and Zeng Qinghong.

Breuer, conspired with Swiss government to imprison American Swiss Banker and
whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld, in order to silence him, and steal and extort the 15K Swiss Bank
accounts to fund black ops in Libya, Benghazi, and Syria, and elsewhere. Birkenfeld must be
subpoenaed to provide info. This report is an addendum to that report.
ORIGINS:
Scott Bennett was in Hong Kong as part of team involved in countering CCP operations against
democrat protesters, and other activities.
During this mission Scott Bennett met and debriefed key human intelligence assets (names and
organizations will remain classified) and gathered information regarding the Chinese Communist
Party and its ongoing terrorist finance operations through Union Bank of Switzerland.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
The CCP and UBS have created a joint-organization, UBS Securities LLC, which is a front
organization used to purchase election-vote counting technology companies (Dominion)
for the purpose of overthrowing the Trump Presidency and TEMPORARILY installing Joe
Biden (who would be quickly replaced, most likely through an assassination blamed on Trump
supporters, or Covid-19, in order to maximize the psyop g i a d d
ca
Bide
legacy.
UBS Securities renamed from Beijing Securities.
According to Cheng Yisun, who participated in the formation of UBS Securities and served as
the general manager, in an interview, the establishment of UBS Securities was decided by the
Beijing Mayor Wang Qishan and Premier Wen Jiabao. He called the establishment of Credit
Suisse Securities as being Born from the Jade and said that UBS Securities has been carrying
a mission since its establishment .
This report will expose the origins of Dominion, Staple Street Capital, and UBS Securities
founded by Wang Qishan in Beijing based on existing public information.
The CCP purchased Dominion for $400 million on October 8. The 400 million US dollars that
Lin Wood refers to is the second capital invested by UBS Securities to Staple Street Capital
which is recorded on the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
In June 2006, under the personal arrangement of Wang Qishan, the mayor of Beijing at the time,
UBS Securities Co. Ltd was formed by UBS Securities Co. Ltd with the acquisition of small
shares by UBS, with Guoxiang Assets under CCB as the controlling party and two state-owned

companies. The board of directors and senior management members have been held by Chinese
since its establishment.
UBS Securities, which invested in Staple Street Capital twice and registered the investment in
New York, does not have a website. From public information, it can be seen that the four
members of the board of directors are three Chinese. In addition, the company's female CEO
works in Brazil instead of New York.
In October before the election, the 400 million US dollars received by Staple Street Capital, plus
the 200 million US dollars received from UBS in December 2014, came from either Beijing or
New York. Why did Staple Street Capital rewash its website in a hurry?
In 2009, ES&S, the largest voting machine manufacturer in the United States at the time,
acquired Premier, the second largest company in the market. However, the new ownership of
ES&S was not more than one year old, when it was broken by a document from the Department
of Justice.
Dana Simpson, a former employee of the Soros Canada Foundation and a technical expert who
cares about election fairness and is also a technical expert, has investigated Dominion for many
years and found that Dominion has become the controller of 30% to 40% of the US bidding
machine market. It was the result of Obama instigating the then Attorney General to operate in
order to keep his re-election.
Dana Simpson discovered that in March 2010, the Ministry of Justice reached a settlement
agreement with ES&S requiring ES&S to sell Premier within 60 days and requiring them to
obtain approval from the Ministry of Justice to accept new buyers.
ES&S sold the company to Dominion, a Canadian company, that had never set foot in the US
market, within the prescribed 60 days, and Dominion hurriedly took over Sequoia, the third
largest voting machine company in the United States within a month. Within a few months,
Dominion had taken full control of the US election market.
In addition to discovering that the Department of Justice helped Canada's Dominon settle in the
United States, Simpson also discovered that Biden, as Vice President with Obama, was also busy
with the same thing at the same time.
Simpson said in a November 2020 survey article in the National File that Biden visited Serbia in
May 2009 to personally recruit computer hackers there to control the future software design for
Dominon. O D i

Coincidentally, when Dominion became the global focus after the general election, more than
one hundred Dominion employees, who accounted for one-third of the total number of
employees, deleted their records on LinkedIn, including Serbian employees.
On July 16, 2018, Dominion issued a press release announcing that Staple Street Capital in New
York and the management team of Dominion had acquired Dominion. The media briefing
described Staple Street Capital as a medium-sized private equity firm.

Group, at almost the same time. (Carlyle Group). Carlyle Group is the umbrella organization of
defense contractor Booz-Allen-Hamilton, responsible for all terrorist financing and Swiss Bank
tracking at U.S. Central Command.
The development history of the Carlyle Group is a prominent representative of the combination
of American political and financial interests. Since its establishment in 1987, the main personnel
who have controlled the company have been members of the Bush family and those who served
as assistants in the Bush administration.
Wikipedia mentions that after the financier Ge ge S

mid-1990 , Ca e financing became easy, and it was obtained through former Secretary of
Defense Frank Carlucci (Frank Carlucci) After the US military's $20 billion arms contract,
Carlyle made the Bush family the world's richest family.
In 2009, Stephen Owens and William Kennard left the Carlyle Group at the same time, and their
titles were both managing directors. Owens founded Staple Street Capital with former Carlyle
colleague Jagbzad, and Kennard served as chairman of the board.
Kennard, as the chairman of the board of directors, took office in Europe this year, and he was
appointed by Obama as ambassador to the EU until 2013. Kennard, a lawyer, was an important
figure during Clinton's presidency. From 1997 to 2001, he served as the chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, in charge of the media and communications in the United States.
In addition, he is a member of the Secretary of State John Kerry's advisory team.
On November 7, 2020, the fourth day after the general election, AT&T Communications
announced that William Kennard was the new chairman of the board. AT&T not only
monopolizes the US communications market, but also indirectly controls its CNN and countless

From the establishment of Dominion, its entry into the United States, and its use as a tool for
stealing elections, from the perspective of the relationships, technical means, and capital
relationships that have been exposed so far, it has all revealed the leading role played by the
Chinese Communist Party.
I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Washington that to
the best of my knowledge, recollection, and experience, the foregoing is true and correct:

Several other people, including myself, noticed that Joe Biden has blue eyes while the person making

23

the appearance had dark eyes. See Exhibits A-D.

Based on the foregoing, I believe the person appearing during the Presidential debates

25

as Joe Biden was, in fact, an imposter and not the former Vice-President of the United States of

26

America. He may have been a body-double.

If so, I believe a great fraud has taken place over national airways and certainly such

inconsistencies may justify an investigation and/or certification of former Vice-P e iden

These people will testify about this and additional material. This material was reported to me to be

2

authored by a lawyer working with George Soros and his organization. This material contained

3

information that clearly showed the AFL-CIO was engaging in a plan to strategically undermine,

4

coerce, falsify, and corrupt the American Presidential election for the purposes of defeating Donald J.

5

Trump, and fraudulently electing Joe Biden. This material also suggested that after the election, Joe

6

Biden would be removed and replaced. See Exhibit 2.

7

10. I received first hand materials from the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons, and

8

personally experienced a training program entitled, DEEP BLACK by David Guyatt, in which

9

Obama-Biden Administration and the Department of Justice and Attorney General Eric Holder and

10

Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, were collaborating with GEO Prison Services to

11

indoctrinate, train, and recruit prisoners into a secret drug trafficking program. See Exhibit 1.

12

11. I shall make myself available to discuss this matter at any time, and would encourage,

13

recommend and implore the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct any other measurable analytics

14

to ascertain and determine if the real vice-president Biden showed up, or whether the person was an

15

impostor.

I declare under penalty of perjury of the laws of the State of Tennessee that, based on a good
faith belief and information, the foregoing is correct and true.
Executed this 25 day of November, 2020, in Washington DC.

•According to state records, at least
259 absentee ballots counted listed

improper ballot harvesting. See
Braynard, supra.
• According to state records, at least
109 people voted absentee from the
Center for Forensic Psychiatry at

implies improper ballot harvesting.
• According to state records, at least
63 people voted absentee at PO BOX
48531, OAK PARK, MI 48237, which
is registered to a professional

Why Does Internet Connectivity Matter?
Exhibit 19 in Sidney Power Michigan lawsuit
The USIC has developed the Hammer and Scorecard
tools, which were released by Wiki Leaks and
independently confirmed by Lt. Gen Thomas
McInerney (USAF, retired), Kirk Wiebe, former NSA
official and Dennis Montgomery, former CIA analyst).
The Hammer and Scorecard capabilities are
tradecrafts used by US intelligence analysts to
conduct MITM attacks on foreign voting systems,
including the Dominion Voting System (DVS)
Democracy Suite and Systems and Software (ES&S)
voting machines without leaving an electronic
fingerprint. As such, these tools are used by nefarious
operators to influence voting systems by covertly
accessing DVS and altering the results in real-time
and without leaving an electronic fingerprint. The
DVS Democracy Suite Election Management System
(EMS) consists of a set of applications that perform
pre-voting and post-voting activities.

Texas Issues with Dominion
•

Some of the hardware in the Democracy 5.5 System can be connected to the internet, but the vendor claims it is protected by hardening of data and IP address features.

•

The foldable ballot box offered with the Democracy 5.5 System could not be used in early voting because it does not have the capability of having 2 locks with two separate keys securing the box as
required by Texas law.

•

The rolling ballot box dividers for provisional or disputed ballot storage were not present, but the vendor claimed such dividers were available. This is important for handling the adjudication of
provisional and contested ballots.

•

The use of COTS printers with the ICX device (in ballot marker mode) is a costsavings measure, but the COTS hardware also presents issues for service, internal drivers for the hardware and the
potential for traditional additional problems with any COTS product. For example, one examiner noted that having the printer tray ajar during the voting process caused the system, after all the races
are voted, to wipe out all selections and require the voter to start over after the print tray is fixed. This would require a poll worker interaction and could greatly slow down the voting process.

•

The Verified Voter Paper Audit Trail ("VVPAT") used with the ICX in DRE mode stores a voters selections in a sequential order, meaning that if a single ICX is used at a voter location and a
limited number voters appear at the polling place, the secrecy of the ballot may be compromised by remembering the order in which voters used the ICX in comparison to the VVPAT tape.

•

The precinct ballot scanner jammed on several occasions and was very slow in scanning the hand-marked ballots.

•

The central scanner/tabulator also jammed on multiple occasions and ballot batches had to be re-run through the scanner. If this happened on a busy election night, it could create a significant delay
in vote tabulation.

•

The "pigtail" portion of the cord connection to the power supply to the VVPAT portion of the ICX was easily accessible and could be unplugged by any voter. When the pigtail was unplugged at the
examiners inspection, the process to get back to a voter-ready condition was unclear and complicated to the point that the battery had to be removed and reinstalled in the device. The vendor, after
the inspection, stated that this power connection can be made behind a sealed door in a different configuration; however, it is clear an end-user may choose to configure the VVP AT in a way that
allows this to occur.

•

The ICX machines had a problem with straight party voting in that the deselection of the straight party choice on a single race eventually leads to the deselection of all of the other straight party
selections.

•

Use of non-sequential numbered paper ballots as required by the Texas Constitution cannot be created within the Democracy 5.5 System. Instead, the only way to comply with this requirement of
the law would be to hand-write and/or pre-print paper with serial numbers in a range for the selected precinct and then manually intermingle the ballots so their numbers are not sequential.

•

The adjudication portion of the tabulation process in the election management software was problematic and showed that the handwritten write-ins subject to adjudication were not easily picked up
by the ballot scanner. This poor resolution on the scanner also failed to pick up some of the printed wording on the ballots. In a follow-up, the vendor stated that only black Sharpie markers should
be used for marking the ballots; however, when the black sharpie was used during testing, it did, on a few occasions, bleed through to the back side of the two-sided ballot in such a way that it could
confuse the ballot scanner or kick the ballot out.

•

The paths for the import of election data in into the election management program also showed multiple opportunities for mistakes that required three (3) separate restarts of the adjudication process.

• Dominion vulnerable to “Man-in-the-Middle” security risks. DVS data transferred to
SCYTL servers in Barcelona, Spain. In 2020, SCYTL data center was moved to Frankfurt.
• Dominion corporate structures were partially designed to obfuscate their complex
relationships, especially with Venezuela, China and Cuba; and impede discovery by
investigators.
• Despite DVS’s constant denial about the flaws of its systems, the company’s ImageCast
Precinct optical scanner system was totally hacked in August 2019. This occurred during
the largest and most notable hacker convention, called DEFCON Voting Machine Hacking
Village in Nevada.
• In 2019, a computer laptop and several USB memory cards containing the cryptographic
key to access DVS systems were stolen in Philadelphia.
• On approximately 2:30 AM EST, TV broadcasts reported that PA, WI, AZ, NV and GA have

Ranked Choice Voting

If any candidates have more votes than the election threshold, they are elected. The number of
votes they received in excess of the threshold then are added to the totals of continuing
candidates. This works by adding a fraction of each vote for the elected candidate to the totals of
the candidate ranked next. For example, if a candidate has 10% more votes than the election
threshold, every one of their voters will have 10% of their vote count for their next choice. That
way, voters aren't punished for honestly ranking a very popular candidate first.

Tabulator Network Connectivity
The ImageCast Listener is an add-on component to the base
EMS system—it is designed as a turnkey solution for
jurisdictions to implement results transmission from their
precinct tabulators and/or RTM client laptops. The system
supports wireless cellular/internet-based transmission,
analog dial-up modem transmission, or both, providing
flexible options to meet a jurisdiction’s particular
requirements and preferences. The jurisdiction is
responsible for providing external access to the back-end
receiving infrastructure.
The base ImageCast Listener system consists of two pieces
of hardware: the ImageCast Listener (ICL) server and a
firewall appliance (WatchGuard Technologies Firebox M200
or XTM 25). When dial-up transmission is used, an
additional Remote Access Server (RAS) is required. The RAS
server uses analog USB modems, connected to the server
via a powered USB 3.0 hub.

1/6/2021

In addition to the base EMS system, the required components for the
ImageCast Listener system, using wireless/internet transmission are:
• ImageCast Listener Server (Dell PowerEdge R330 recommended)

• WatchGuard Technologies Firebox M200 or XTM 25 firewall
appliance
• 2 x CAT5e or CAT6 Ethernet cables
• 1 x external wireless modem (eDevices CellGo) per precinct
(multiple tabulators in a precinct can share the same modem if
transmission is performed serially, rather than simultaneously).

When dial-up transmission is used, the RAS server component is
required in addition to the components listed above:
• Remote Access Server (Dell PowerEdge R330 recommended)

• Powered 10-port USB 3.0 hub
• USB analog dial-up modems (up to 10)

• 1 x CAT5e or CAT6 Ethernet cable
Note: analog modems on the transmitting end are built into the
ImageCast Precinct tabulator.

Cambridge City Council,
Clerk, Cambridge City Council
I write to urge the Council to vote to let the Cabot, Cabot and Forbes zoning petition for the Alewife
Quadrangle expire. The CCF petition has gone above and beyond any rational conception of common
sense and appropriate planning. The proposed zoning change mightily conflicts with the Envision
Cambridge recommendation to preserve light industry uses in the northwest corner of the quad.
Furthermore, the lack of a guarantee of a bridge over the railroad tracks is a major failure of CCF goodfaith dealing with the city. This foolishness has been going on for years now. Also, this proposal of six
large buildings of almost 1 million square feet completely disregards the possibility of any green area.
And, the lack of a strong commitment to build housing is glaringly apparent when over 50 percent of
commercial space is to be built before any construction of residential housing even starts.
For the Council to allow this developer-backed, piecemeal process of building to continue while
disregarding all the money and hours of community and city government planning of Envision
Cambridge is the foolish equivalent of attempting to put fun into dysfunctionality.

Upzoning Alewife

Dear City Councilors:
Regarding the Up-Zoning Petition proposed for The Quad.
It was just a few short years ago, before many of you were elected to the council, that in response to
major public dissatisfaction with the out of control development in Alewife that the council initiated a
comprehensive planning process to give the public faith that subsequent development would be
guided by a conscious and informed vision for the area.
Because the proposed up-zoning barely pays lip service to the vision I hope the city council will not
allow it to go forward. I am also quite skeptical that the petitioner is serious about their commitment to
public benefits, in particular, the bridge commitment seems pretty suspect.
Please do the right thing.

NO to upzoning the CC&F proposal @ the Quad

14 March 2021
Dear City Councilors,
We ask you to please vote no regarding APP 2020 #39, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes proposal to up zone 26 acres
in the Alewife Quadrangle.
Allowing CC&F to build to 110 feet (three times what it’s currently zoned for) flies in the face of the 2019
Alewife District Plan, which designates this area for light industry, not big buildings. No matter how many
goodies CC&F throws at the City—a possible bridge across the commuter rail tracks, more housing (98
affordable units) and retail—it just doesn’t make sense to build this huge complex in the Great Swamp, where it
will flood, and completely ignore the collective community vision expressed in the Envision study. We don’t
want big buildings and an influx of commuters there—the traffic is already horrible. And where will we put the
City’s waste transfer station and the site’s other more gritty businesses (trucking, warehouses, demolition and
gravel and sand)? They must go somewhere.
It’s critical that the City prioritize updating zoning for the Quadrangle, in keeping with the ADP’s
recommendations, and ensure that this “last frontier” becomes the vibrant mixed- use district it imagined with
trees, open space networks, and public amenities that promote walkability and increase opportunities for social
connection. The current proposal is not sustainable development. It is antithetical to it. This is a horrible
precedent.
We urge you to put a pause on reviewing upzoning proposals at the Quad until the Envision ADP is accepted
and zoned. Reviewing upzoning proposals now is a distraction and not fair to the City or to Cambridge
Community Development, which is clearly overwhelmed. How can the CDD focus on developing a roadmap for
going forward, ensuring a healthier City and greater Alewife community, when they are constantly put on
defense, reviewing individual development proposals? What we need is thoughtful review before this massive
upzoning is imposed on us and our City.
Thank you for your attention and commitment to building a healthy Cambridge.
Sincerely,
Cathie Zusy

proposed zoning upgrade for Alewife Quadrangle CC&F

14 March 2021
Dear City Councilors,
We ask you to please vote no regarding APP 2020 #39, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes proposal to up zone
26 acres in the Alewife Quadrangle.
The CC&F proposal to build to 110 feet (three times what it’s currently zoned for) has been shown to
violate the spirit and letter of the 2019 Alewife District Plan, which designates this area for light
industry, not big buildings.
As many other objectors are pointing out, a huge complex in the Great Swamp invites water flow
problems, massive interruption and loss of public green space, and increased traffic even as
congestion is already beyond the reasonable growth stage. And where will we put the City’s waste
transfer station and the site’s other more gritty businesses (trucking, warehouses, demolition and
gravel and sand)? They must go somewhere.
The city needs to conduct a thoughtful review and apply upgraded zoning regs for the Quadrangle
before this massive upzoning is imposed on us. Green bandaids afterwards will not suffice.
We urge you to put a pause on reviewing upzoning proposals at the Quad until the Envision ADP is
accepted and zoned independently from the CC&F or any other immediate time-sensitive proposal.
Thank you for your attention and commitment to building a healthy Cambridge.
Sincerely,
Laura Nash and Thomas Beale

No-go on the NW Quad Up-zoning Proposal

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,
I urge you to vote ‘no-go’ on the Alewife Quadrangle Contract Overlay District (the NW Quad). The planning is not far
enough along at this juncture to support the upzoning. Among the particularly problematic aspects of this up-zoning
proposal are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The lack of a legally enforceable railroad track crossing
The individuals involved in the East Cambridge’s Eversource problem are involved here (should they not be
disqualified?)
We need far MORE housing here
We need far LESS parking here
We need far more open space here
We need that real community benefits are included – among these day care and a middle school

Cordially,
Suzanne Blier
5 Fuller Place

Quadrangle Upzoning

14 March 2021
,
We ask you to please vote no regarding APP 2020 #39, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes proposal to up zone 26 acres
in the Alewife Quadrangle.
Allowing CC&F to build to 110 feet (three times what it’s currently zoned for) flies in the face of the 2019
Alewife District Plan, which designates this area for light industry, not big buildings. No matter how many
goodies CC&F throws at the City—a possible bridge across the commuter rail tracks, more housing (98
affordable units) and retail—it just doesn’t make sense to build this huge complex in the Great Swamp, where it
will flood, and completely ignore the collective community vision expressed in the Envision study. We don’t
want big buildings and an influx of commuters there—the traffic is already horrible. And where will we put the
City’s waste transfer station and the site’s other more gritty businesses (trucking, warehouses, demolition and
gravel and sand)? They must go somewhere.
It’s critical that the City prioritize updating zoning for the Quadrangle, in keeping with the ADP’s
recommendations, and ensure that this “last frontier” becomes the vibrant mixed- use district it imagined with
trees, open space networks, and public amenities that promote walkability and increase opportunities for social
connection. The current proposal is not sustainable development. It is antithetical to it. This is a horrible
precedent.
What we need is thoughtful review before this massive upzoning is imposed on us and our City.
We urge you to put a pause on reviewing upzoning proposals at the Quad until the Envision ADP is accepted
and zoned. Reviewing upzoning proposals now is a distraction and not fair to the City or to Cambridge
Community Development, which is clearly overwhelmed. How can the CDD focus on developing a roadmap for
going forward, ensuring a healthier City and greater Alewife community, when they are constantly put on
defense, reviewing individual development proposals?
Thank you for your attention and commitment to building a healthy Cambridge.
Sincerely,
YOUR NAME & address

Dear Council Members:
I oppose the Up-zoning of the Alewife Quad.......It does nothing to improve the quality of life for that area and
there are no guarantees that a previously unreliable Developer will actually "come through".
Furthermore, as usual while there is "Affordable Housing" in the mix and now mention of "Middle Income
Housing", there is no attention given to the dire need for "Low-income Housing" in Cambridge!

Up-zoning of NW Quad area of Alewife Not Good Enough

March 15, 2021
Re: Upzoning Proposal for for the NW Quad
Good Morning Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon and City Councillors,
The zoning petition and commitments from developer Cabot, Cabot, and Forbes (CCF) for the NW Quad area of Alewife,
although improved, is not enough. I ask the Council to let the petition expire so the developer can refile a stronger
proposal with the following assurances:
•
•
•

•

A solid guarantee of a bridge. The community is tired of empty promises in relation to the bridge.
A more robust housing plan that has assurances. We have seen what happened in East Cambridge with this
Developer and fear the same will happen again.
Community benefits are inadequate. With so much land potentially under control by the developer, besides a
bridge, there is the opportunity to offer open space such as a park and allocate space for other
community benefits and amenities. Given the massive growth in the community, there needs to be
accomodation for for services, such as a new library, day care, retail space for small businesses and
consideration for a new middle school.
It is good to see a green/solar roof component incorporated in the project. I would like to see the
green/solar roofs on all properties, including the labs, not just the housing portions of the development

Thank you for your consideration,
Nicola Williams

A Few Additional Thoughts on the CC&F Rezoning

Importance:

High

Dear Councilors,
Please accept these last remaining thoughts on the Quadrangle Northwest rezoning petition
before you this evening. These final notes are in addition to the many other emails detailing my
continuing concerns that I have submitted to you previously. Some of these prior concerns
include:
• The willful disguising of this zoning petition as a citizen-sponsored effort contrary to
standards of transparency
• The need for flood resiliency standards in keeping with the site’s location within the
flood plain.
• Adherence to the best practices included in the Cambridge stormwater management
plan released last year (https://www.cambridgema.gov//media/Files/publicworksdepartment/stormwatermanagement/cambridgeswmpfinal_2019
0628_allphotos_compiled.pdf). On page 60, the report states that "EPA recommends that
the City require any stormwater management system designed to infiltrate stormwater
on commercial and industrial sites provide the level of pollutant removal equal to or
greater than the level of pollutant removal provided using biofiltration of the same
volume of runoff to be infiltrated prior to infiltration. The City does not currently require
infiltration to this level but will consider including it as part of MCM 5, Section 5.5.”
• The need for a fully-guaranteed bridge (in addition to the City’s long-promised bridge
at the other end of the Quad)
• A full rebuild of Smith Place (similar to how New Street was rebuilt, with continuous
sidewalks and bike paths on both sides)
• Inclusion of a linear path running along the southern edge of the train tracks (the
northern edge of CC&F property) from Brighton Street (Belmont) to Wheeler Street, as
shown in the Envision Alewife District Plan and the City’s most recent Bicycle Plan
• More open space within their 12-acre site, including a dedicated outdoor community
green space that doesn’t have a road running through it
• In addition to 20% affordable housing units, an additional 10% for middle-income units
• Responsibility for all the utility infrastructure needed to serve their proposed buildings
• Support for a branch library or fire station, as first suggested in the Alewife Fish Book
plan of 1979

• Requiring the timely completion of the entire project within a 10-year time frame,
and also that residential and public amenity components of the project be completed
first as was previously required for both the Volpe Center and Kendall MXD rezoning
petitions
• Removing any mention of a “Poison Pill” that would limit the City’s ability to
undertake rezoning efforts until the entire CC&F project is completed, particularly in
light of the City’s current efforts related to Tree Canopy, Climate Resilient Zoning, and
the impending translation of the Envision Alewife Plan into new zoning.
In addition, by its own definition the proposed rezoning is specifically for “phased, multi-site
projects.” And yet in its commitment letter, CC&F fails to mention two other abutting
parcels that it recently purchased: 67 Smith (3.8 acres purchased by CCF Smith Place
Property Co LLC on 10/1/2020 for a combined $43.9 million) and 160/180 Fawcett Street (0.77
acres purchased by CCF Fawcett Street Property Company LLC on 12/15/2020 for $9.625
million). Neither LLC is listed as a signatory in the most recent version of the Letter of
Understanding between CC&F and the City, making one wonder what else Mr. Doherty is not
telling you. Word on the street is that he has already been shopping his new land around, just as
he has done with other properties in the past. Perhaps you should ask him to clarify his
intentions before handing him such a large financial reward. Better yet, you should reject this
petition and send the petitioner a clear message that the City has no time for bad actors and bad
behavior of this kind.
Worse, there is still no mention of the actual Letter of Understanding in the most recent
zoning language. It seems unlikely that this letter will “guarantee” the desired outcomes if no
mention of it whatsoever is incorporated into the new zoning text! The same is likely true of
Mr. Doherty’s other promises. Indeed, nothing in the requested zoning would guarantee
housing, a bridge, local retail, open space, or any of the other much-hyped public benefits.
Such a limited result is contrary to the desired outcomes put forward by the community and
documented in the final report of the Envision Alewife Working Group, of which I was a
member. Please honor our community’s wishes and the planning process we all engaged in by
asking the Community Development Department to begin working to implement the Working
Group’s final recommendations immediately.
Finally, I must once again point out that Councilor McGovern has a long history of backroom
discussions with Mr. Doherty and his associates, both before and after CC&F’s purchase of
these parcels. Following the defeat of the Climate Safety Petition that would have imposed new
resiliency requirements on this site, Councilor McGovern also received $11,000 in campaign
donations from Mr. Doherty, Mr. Doherty’s friends, family, and business associates. Either
Councilor McGovern must come clean publicly about these conflicts of interest and return
all of these donations, or else he must recuse himself from voting on this petition. Simple
principles of good government and basic ethics require as much.
Thank you for your consideration.

Abstract
Reducing food waste was heralded as the highest impact method to combat climate change by
a leading consortium of scientists at Project Drawdown.1 After three years of conducting primary
research into this problem, Cambridge Table to Farm, the Cambridge Business Associations,
Cambridge Chamber of Commerce, 31 restaurants, and over 300 signatories together urge the
City Council to implement a commercial composting pilot program for restaurants. We calculate
that a program with 100 restaurants would:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Divert upwards of 5,000 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions from the environment per year
Save local restaurants $1,000 to $25,000 annually per restaurant
Provide restaurants a hedge against increasing trash costs across the next 5 years
Help address landfill capacity shortages by removing 6,000 tons of waste per year

In this paper, we present the environmental case for a commercial composting program, the
financial case, and our story.

The Proposal
Informed by our primary research, and supported by the broader community, we urge City
Council to:
1. Develop a pilot program for small to mid-sized businesses to begin commercial
composting / anaerobic digestion
2. Set an explicit goal of 100 participants and track total food waste diverted as part of the
City’s Sustainability Dashboard
3. Fund a budget between $300,000 - $500,000 and limit participation to businesses with
less than 50 employees
4. Establish a strategy for expanding to organizations with greater than 50 employees
5. Incorporate the following elements into the pilot project:

The Environmental Argument
Summary: Diverting restaurant food waste will make a massive impact on emissions.
Food waste becomes methane when it decomposes in landfills and has emerged as an
extraordinary contributor to climate change. The problem is so severe that Project Drawdown, a
leading consortium of scientists studying climate change, has ranked reducing food waste as
the highest impact technique to decrease our carbon footprint, capable of diverting over 87
gigatons of CO2 equivalent emissions from the atmosphere over the next 30 years. If food waste
itself were its own country, it would be third behind China and the US in terms of overall
greenhouse gas emissions.2
After interviewing approximately 20 restaurants in Cambridge, we found that the average small
to medium size restaurant wastes approximately 60 tons of food per year.3 Applying the EPA
Waste Reduction Model (WARM), this is the equivalent of 5,300 tons of divertable CO2
emissions each year.4

Beyond the emissions, moving food waste to compost facilities also reduces our reliance on
landfills and waste-to-energy centers that present general hazards to human health.5 Diverting

water-logged organics from waste-to-energy centers further optimizes plant operational
efficiency.6

The Restaurant Argument
Summary: Restaurants not currently composting will be able to avoid large MassDEP fines
effective Oct. 2021, and will be given the opportunity to substantially reduce their trash pickup
costs. Restaurants that currently compost will save thousands by no longer paying for service.

Help Restaurants Save Money Composting
There are many restaurants in Cambridge that currently pay for composting. A
government-sponsored composting service will immediately save them thousands to tens of
thousands dollars. Daniel Myers, the owner of Loyal Nine Restaurant explains, “Composting is
by far the best way to dispose of waste in a sustainable fashion, and most restaurants provide
loads of it. We spend over $10,000 annually on composting as is.”

Help Restaurants Avoid Fines
In October of 2021, the Massachusetts DEP will start implementing fines up to $25,000 per
violation for any institution that wastes more than ½ ton of food waste per week.7 From our
primary research, the vast majority of Cambridge restaurants will automatically fall into the ½ ton
per week bucket.
A small business composting pilot program would assist local restaurants in remaining
compliant and avoid fines associated with dumping organic waste.

Help Restaurants Save on Trash Fees
A government-sponsored commercial composting program will reduce the volume of restaurant
trash by over 30 percent, providing restaurants the opportunity to renegotiate their trash-hauling
contracts and save substantially on pickup fees.8
It is particularly important to give restaurants a lever to reduce their trash contracts given future
landfill capacity projections. Massachusetts landfills have already utilized ~83% of their
permitted capacity, and are predicted to grow towards 100% utilization throughout the next 5

years.9 As this process unfolds, it stands to reason that landfill tipping fees will increase, which
will push higher trash prices onto restaurants.

The Government Argument
Summary: The restaurant industry needs support urgently from the government.

Provide Pandemic Relief
The pandemic has been an enormously difficult time for the restaurant industry. In
Massachusetts, 1 in 5 restaurants have closed, and 93% have laid off employees. The National
Restaurant Association reports that there has been a 96% decline in restaurant sales with the
average loss greater than 80%.10
Under these circumstances, the Cambridge government should use every innovative approach
at its disposal to help the industry regain its former strength, including (but not limited to) the
ideas laid out in this proposal.

Cambridge businesses have previously expressed their interest to participate in a curbside
composting program. Their interest was raised as a policy order (POR 2018 #147) that the City
Council passed in 2018. In April of 2019, another policy order (POR 2019 #133) was passed to
hear the details of their findings. The City is in a unique position to implement this program to
offer economic relief while making environmental strides associated with emissions goals and
the Zero Waste Master Plan.11

Reduce Landfill Utilization
As landfills fill up, Massachusetts has been exporting at least 22% of its waste to other states as
far as Ohio, subjecting business owners and individual state taxpayers to additional
transportation fees highlighted in the table below:12

Given this current situation, cities across the Commonwealth should work together to find places
to divert waste from landfills. Food waste, led by Cambridge’s example, is a prime place to start.

Nuts and Bolts
Budget
The average Cambridge restaurant wastes between two to three 64-gallon trash bags of food
per night.13 After aggregating quotes from five local haulers applied across five different
restaurants, and considering cost reductions that could be achieved with economies of scale, an
investment ranging from $300,000 - $500,000 will be sufficient to fund a 100 small-business
pilot program.14

This budget is consistent with historical precedent for similar, parallel, programs. According to
the FY18 Adopted Budget, $100,000 was allocated to launch a small business recycling
program. In the FY19 Adopted Budget, $150,000 was budgeted for a recycling pilot with up to
150 small businesses and twice weekly pickup.
Restaurant Size
Small to mid-sized restaurants (< 50 employees) are an ideal target market over larger
restaurants or franchises for the following reasons:
1. It is easy to connect directly with the owners who are critical to the implementation of
composting programs
2. These restaurants are most in need of post-pandemic government assistance due to
financial strain
Pickup Frequency
With two to three 64-gallon trash bags of food waste anticipated per night, it is important that the
city provides three to four pickups per week to prevent issues with odor.
Bins and Rodents
All standard composting bins have a locking mechanism, which has proven effective at deterring
rodents both in the Cambridge residential composting program as well as for restaurants that
already compost in Cambridge.
Educational Training
To implement an effective composting program, it is critical that multilingual educational training
is provided for kitchen staff. Restaurants must properly educate their staff on how to dispose of
their food waste. This will ensure that trash does not go in the compost and that food waste
does not go in the trash. Furthermore, to maximize effectiveness, the training should include
visual graphics hung around the kitchen and should be provided at multiple times during the
pilot project to address high staff turnover.

Prioritize Local Businesses
We urge the city to prioritize local organics haulers including the following vendors. All have
demonstrated a willingness to pick-up food waste at a reasonable price. Our team has decided
not to weigh in on the topic of anaerobic digestion versus composting, as we feel the highest
priority must be the sustainable management of organics waste in general. However, we do
encourage the government to prioritize solutions where each local hauler gets some business.
One way to do this would be to assign different organics haulers to different business
association districts.

Testimonials
Composting can be quite a challenge for smaller restaurants. A Cambridge-run
program that was able to function alongside the existing resident composting
would be very helpful!
- Patrick Lynch, Founder/CEO of Bon Me
Our restaurant group has been composting since we first opened in 2008.
Despite the added financial expense and logistical challenges of teaching staff
new practices regarding refuse separation, we recognized the long-term value of
thoughtful waste management.
- John Kessen, Co-owner of Mamaleh's Delicatessen
We have been a zero trash business for nearly 15 years and the pressures of the
pandemic make composting incredibly hard to manage and afford. Municipal pick
up would instantly provide us with a way to continue and expand our efforts to
reduce our carbon footprint and foster workplace and customer engagement in
waste reduction and management for the purpose of addressing climate change.
Kari Kuelzer, General Manager at Grendel’s Den Restaurant and Bar
Our family has supported CERO since it was founded and it is led and worked by
community people and we have visited them in Roxbury. It not only is important
for the environment it will further provide good paying jobs to local people.
$300,000 investment while we are sitting on a 'rainy fund'? This is an investment
that is a no brainer in helping small businesses and the health of our community.
- Kathy Roberts, Cambridge Resident
Composting is essential to fighting climate change, and Cambridge has always
been a leader on environmental issues. Let’s continue to lead and show other
cities how to make an impact!
- Amy Antczak, Coordinator at Mothers Out Front
We need to support our small businesses in the transition to a green economy.
Already struggling from the devastating impact of COVID-- our restaurants need
help to build back smart and sustainably. It's an excellent use of scarce
resources to invest in this type of infrastructure support
- Jude Glaubman, Cambridge Resident
Composting is by far the best way to dispose of waste in a sustainable fashion,
and most restaurants provide loads of it. We spend over $10,000 annually on
composting as is.
- Daniel Myers, Owner of Loyal Nine Restaurant

Our Story and Approach
Summary: We are a network of current and former Cambridge residents concerned about
climate change who have investigated the topic of restaurant food waste for 3 years in order to
deliver this report.
Cambridge Table to Farm started in 2018 as a small group of Cambridge residents concerned
about climate change. For six months, we held bi-weekly brain-storming sessions, researching
how we could make an impact on emissions by inviting the broader community to our home in
Porter Square. Reading through literature, we identified reducing food waste via composting /
anaerobic digestion as a unique challenge. The opportunity to make an impact was enormous:
100 restaurants composting calculated to be the equivalent of planting 800,000 trees (more
information from The Environmental Argument). Composting was an approachable aim for a
grassroots organization. Lastly, we were all familiar with the solution space as avid supporters of
Cambridge’s residential composting initiative.
For the ensuing year, we interviewed grocery stores, restaurant owners, organics haulers, and
more to better understand where food was being wasted and how we could help. In these
interviews, we recorded the amount of food that different institutions were throwing away,
calculated the environmental impact, assessed the general appetite for composting, and
observed potential barriers. During this time, our group grew from a few close friends to a large
network of Cambridge professionals spanning engineers, environmentalists, designers, medical
students, teachers, investors, consultants and more.
By the end of 2019, it was clear that there was a strong appetite for composting amongst
Cambridge restaurants, and a tremendous opportunity to make an impact on the environment.
We decided to test this hypothesis with a small pilot project. We selected five restaurants that
had expressed higher-than-average interest in composting, spanning different restaurant
categories (franchise, small restaurant, medium restaurant, large restaurant). We compiled
comprehensive reports of the environmental impact and provided the restaurants with
competitive quotes from haulers to see if we could convince a few to start composting. Of the
five:
●
●
●

●

One started composting after receiving our quote and has plans to start composting at
their next restaurant
One started composting in between the time of our first contact and when we actually
delivered their quote
Two did not start composting, despite a strong interest. They taught us about the hurdles
that larger restaurants face in changing the operational flow of a kitchen, and informed
the paper’s selection of a target market
One ceased communication with us almost immediately after the pandemic began, and
we have been unable to retrieve conclusive results

Navigating the pandemic has been challenging. Restaurants were (and still are) struggling, and
it no longer seemed appropriate to ask these restaurants to consider composting as they
dedicated their resources to survival. We took the opportunity to pivot our approach, meeting
with members of different nonprofits and governmental organizations to reassess our strategy.
Out of this period, we arrived at a singular conclusion: a municipal-grade composting program
would be the best path forward. It would be amazing for the environment. It would help
restaurants financially. Lastly, it would be beneficial for the city as landfills approach capacity
and statewide emissions fail to meet standards.
In this report, we have presented our case for these ideas, as well as the community support for
our proposal. It is our dream that many cities will provide their restaurants with commercial
composting programs some day. If Cambridge leads the way, other cities will follow.

Appendix
Full Petition Signed by the Community
Below is the proposal we circulated throughout the Cambridge community:
As we've witnessed in our neighborhood, many restaurants have closed in Cambridge since the
start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the urgency of taking bold and immediate action
to reduce our community’s greenhouse gas emissions has never been more clear. By helping
our restaurants waste less food, Cambridge can take real, measurable steps to mitigate these
dual crises. A citywide commercial composting program for restaurants and small businesses
could be implemented quickly and would be a win-win for all stakeholders.
Support our restaurants:
● Help restaurants avoid penalties for non-compliance with MassDEP food waste limits
● These penalties are set to become significantly more stringent in October 2021, without
a compliance roadmap
● Enable restaurants to save money on trash-hauling contracts via volume reduction
Support our environment:
● 100 Cambridge restaurants composting will divert upwards of 5,000 tons of CO2-eq
emissions per year, comparable to planting 800,000 trees according to US EPA
estimates
● Environmental think tank, Project Drawdown, has consistently ranked reducing food
waste as one of the top 3 ways to address climate change worldwide
Support our community:
● Improper trash management causes public health and environmental impacts, with a
disproportionately negative impact on low-income communities
● Landfills are filling up; proper waste-stream disposal saves taxpayers money on fees
With this Petition, Cambridge Table to Farm and all signatories together urge the City to:
1. Develop a pilot program for small businesses to begin commercial composting
2. Set an explicit goal of 100 participants and track total food waste diverted as part of the
City’s Sustainability Dashboard
3. Fund a budget of $300k, similar to the Small Business Recycling Pilot of 2018, and limit
participation to businesses with less than 50 employees, with the aim of expanding to
larger businesses in the future
4. Establish a proceeding and application program for expanding to participants greater
than the 50-employee threshold

Restaurant Interviewing Methodology
For over a year, our team dined at restaurants in the community bi-weekly and spoke directly
with General Managers and/or Owners. Our goals for these discussions included:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Determine whether they already composted
If they were not composting, determine their interest in composting
Calculate the quantity of food they were wasting per year
Calculate the potential environmental impact
Identify their barriers to composting

We were immensely fortunate to meet with such a wonderful community of restaurant leaders!

When ascertaining the quantity of food restaurants were wasting annually, we would bring a
64-gallon trash bag and ask how many bags were thrown away nightly. We then asked what
percent of the volume was food waste. In many cases, restaurant owners also let us inspect the
size of their dumpster, which allowed us to double check estimates. While this process was
imperfect, taking the average of scores of restaurants over the course of a year enabled us to
conclude a reasonable figure of 60 tons of food waste per year.
To double check ourselves, we used secondary sources to calculate that the average US
restaurant wastes about 18 tons of food per year. With Cambridge being the target community, a
densely packed urban area, and because our target market was sit-down restaurants, not
take-out businesses which biased the national average, we felt further confident that 60 tons per
year was a reasonable estimate.

What We’re Proposing:
● Launch an opt-in, commercial composting program for 100 restaurants and small
businesses to support the local economy and enable sustainable business practices
● Fund a budget of $300,000 - $500,000 (roughly 10% of the existing DPW
Trash/Recycling budget) complete with totes and educational material
● Prioritize supporting local, women-, and minority-owned restaurants and local
pick-up/hauling services to support Cambridge’s economy equitably

Why? Environmental Impact
Diverting food waste from landfills has been ranked as the #1 way to make an impact on
climate change according to a leading consortium of scientists at ​Project Drawdown​.

Why? Support Small Businesses in Cambridge Today and Tomorrow
● Restaurants that do not compost will avoid MassDEP food waste fines, set to be as
high as $25,000 per violation starting in October 2021.
● Restaurants could substantially save money by renegotiating trash contracts for
less waste. This will be particularly important over the next decade, as MA
landfills reach capacity and trash prices increase.
● Restaurants already composting will save between $1,000 to $10,000 as they will
no longer need to pay for a composting service.

APP 2020 #39

14 March 2021
Dear City Councilors,
Please vote NO regarding APP 2020 #39, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes proposal to up zone 26 acres in the Alewife
Quadrangle.
Allowing CC&F to build to 110 feet (three times what it’s currently zoned for) flies in the face of the 2019
Alewife District Plan, which designates this area for light industry, not big buildings. No matter how many
goodies CC&F throws at the City—a possible bridge across the commuter rail tracks, more housing (98
affordable units) and retail—it just doesn’t make sense to build this huge complex in the Great Swamp, where it
will flood, and completely ignore the collective community vision expressed in the Envision study. We don’t
want big buildings and an influx of commuters there—the traffic is already horrible. And where will we put the
City’s waste transfer station and the site’s other more gritty businesses (trucking, warehouses, demolition and
gravel and sand)? They must go somewhere.
It is critical that the City prioritize updating zoning for the Quadrangle, in keeping with the ADP’s
recommendations, and ensure that this “last frontier” becomes the vibrant mixed-use district it imagined with
trees, open space networks, and public amenities that promote walkability and increase opportunities for social
connection.
The current proposal is not sustainable development. It is antithetical to it. This is a horrible precedent.
What we need is thoughtful review before this massive up zoning is imposed on us and our City.
Please put a pause on reviewing up zoning proposals at the Quad until the Envision ADP is accepted and
zoned. Reviewing up zoning proposals now is a distraction and not fair to the City or to Cambridge Community
Development, which is clearly overwhelmed. How can the CDD focus on developing a roadmap for going
forward, ensuring a healthier City and greater Alewife community, when they are constantly put on defense,
reviewing individual development proposals?
Thank you for your attention and commitment to building a healthy Cambridge.
Sincerely,
Shelagh Hadley
244 Brattle St. apt 32

Yes on Order 5

Of course Cambridge should support engagement with Cuba and ending the blockade and sanctions. Cuba has and has
always had the right to have whatever form of government it chooses, and virtually all of its government actions over
the past 6 decades that have been characterized as aggressive or threatening by the U.S. government have been actions
to enable its survival and prosperity against the aggression and threats from the hemisphere bully, the U.S.
Much appreciation for the councilors who are bringing this forward.

Cambridge Bicycle Committee Support for Pedestrian / Bike Bridge in Alewife
Quadrangle

Dear City Councillors,
On behalf of the Cambridge Bicycle Committee, I would like to join the Pedestrian Committee in expressing support for the
proposed pedestrian / bike bridge connecting the Alewife Quadrangle and the Alewife MBTA station area as a requirement for
the requested zoning changes. The letter shown below, written by the Pedestrian Committee, was reviewed by the Bicycle
Committee at its March 10 meeting. We agreed that it is in alignment with our goals of promoting safe connectivity for people
on foot and on bike in the neighborhood to local transit, nearby bicycle facilities, and housing.
Kind regards,
Mark Boswell,
Cambridge Bicycle Committee Chair

The Pedestrian Committee works to create a more comfortable, safe, and pleasant environment for
walking in Cambridge. A new pedestrian/bike bridge across the tracks in the Alewife area, thereby
connecting the growing developments in the Quadrangle to the Triangle and to the MBTA station
and beyond is a necessary addition to our current infrastructure.
The absence of a bridge creates highly circuitous walking routes that act as a deterrent to the city's
vision of a walkable, transit-friendly community. This disadvantages walking, biking, and transit
relative to automobile travel, and is thus inconsistent with the City's strategies for greenhouse gas
reductions.
The Committee urges you to ensure that any zoning changes made in the Alewife Quadrangle are
accompanied by a strong, binding commitment to construct a pedestrian/bike bridge across the
tracks, bringing within reach a trip to the Alewife T station and the nearby multiuse paths.

Cuba Policy Order

To: Cambridge City Council:

We urge the Council to vote in favor of Policy Order #2021-50, #5 on the next agenda,
calling upon President Biden to immediately restore the policies and regulations
between Cuba and the United States to those of the Obama-Biden era and then to
support ending the Cuban Embargo. It is astonishing that the United States sees no
problem in trading with countries that it is at odds with (Russia, Saudi Arabia, and
China, to name a few) but enforce a strong embargo against Cuba because of
pressure from right-wing Cubans in Florida.
The Cuban Economy was beginning to flourish under Obama-Biden reform policies,
but then was ravaged by the Trump rage-campaign.
Cambridge has always been supportive to human right's campaigns throughout the
world. Change usually comes when the "grassroots" organizes and speaks. We urge
the Council once again to lead in this effort to restore humane relationships with the
Cuban people by passing Policy Order #2021-50.

Commitments and conditions accompanying the Petition for Alewife Overlay District
1 (Quadrangle Northwest) Zoning attached hereto as Attachment A (the “AOD-1
Zoning”)

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey,
and Zondervan:
This letter describes commitments and benefits which CCF ASVRF 127 Smith, LLC, CCF ASVRF
13 Mooney, LLC, and CCF ASVRF 45-61 Mooney, LLC (collectively, the “Proponent”) are
prepared to offer to the City of Cambridge to facilitate and enable the Proponent’s use and
development of the land surrounding Mooney Street in Alewife Overlay District 1 (the “Property”)
that may be proposed in accordance with the AOD-1 Zoning, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth below.
At the request of the Planning Board, the Community Development Department restructured the
AOD-1 Zoning petition to ensure that it is consistent with Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (the
“Zoning Ordinance”). The Petition requires that the Planning Board make findings that the Project
is consistent with the goals and objectives set forth in the Fall 2019 Envision Alewife District Plan
(the “Envision Alewife Plan”).
“Project” is defined to mean the phased development of the Property as approved under a
Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit in accordance with the AOD-1 Zoning.
All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the AOD-1 Zoning
or the Zoning Ordinance. This Letter of Commitment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of all successor owners of the Property or any part thereof subject to the conditions set forth herein.

form acceptable to the City. The City may name these public ways and/or
the Alewife Public Bridge after individuals and/or organizations that reflect
the diversity of the City.
iii. The Proponent will cooperate with the City and adjacent neighborhoods to
create publicly accessible pedestrian access to the Project if desired by the
City, and in order to achieve this, the Proponent commits to convey
permanent real property interests in fee or by easements to the City
sufficient to assure such permanent public pedestrian access to the Project,
including but not limited to the Alewife Public Bridge and common areas
and public areas on the Property.
4. Sustainability and Open Space.
i. The Project’s Open Space Plan will include family-friendly play areas, and
areas that can be utilized for public arts or community programming. The
hardscaping treatment will utilize extensive use of permeable pavers.
ii. Except for parking and non-occupiable areas, all first-floor elevations
within the Project will be at or above the 100-year 2070 SLR/SS elevation.
iii. Residential and garage buildings will provide rooftop solar or other
sustainable energy production or green roofs.
iv. Shared parking building(s) will include at least 25% of spaces with electric
vehicle charging stations and 100% of spaces with conduit in-place ready
for electric vehicle charging stations.
5. Alewife Public Bridge.
i. The Alewife Public Bridge will be designed in substantial conformance
with the concepts and cost estimates prepared by Rosales Partners attached
hereto as Attachment B (the “Bridge Plans”). The Bridge Plans provide
that the Alewife Public Bridge (a) spans approximately 130 feet from the

Property across the MBTA Fitchburg Commuter Rail right of way (“MBTA
ROW”), (b) has a clear width of 16 feet, (c) has a clear height of
approximately 21 feet above the MBTA ROW, and (d) on the northern side,
ramps down within the MBTA ROW and connects to private land.
ii. Within sixty (60) days of AOD-1 Zoning being duly adopted in the form
attached hereto, and no challenge to the validity of the same shall have been
made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge shall have been
finally resolved in favor of such validity), the Proponent will retain a
consultant of the City’s choosing, at a cost not to exceed $150,000, to
complete a feasibility analysis of a shuttle system between the Quadrangle
and the Triangle. The consultant will take direction from the City of
Cambridge staff.
iii. The Proponent will use commercially reasonable efforts to retain Rosales
Partners (or another designer preferred by the City subject to Proponent’s
reasonable consent) and work collaboratively with the City and the MBTA
to advance the Bridge Plans as needed to obtain the Bridge Approvals as
defined in Section A.5(iv). If the shuttle feasibility analysis referenced in
Section A.5(ii) concludes that a shuttle route is feasible over this Alewife
Public Bridge, and as a result the Bridge Plans are modified to accommodate
a clear width of up to 20 feet (vs. 16 foot clear width currently assumed in
the Bridge Plans), then in addition to all other funding obligations under
Section A.5, the Proponent will contribute up to $2,000,000 of additional
funds towards the completion of this Alewife Public Bridge.
iv. The Alewife Public Bridge requires due diligence, entitlements, approvals,
permissions, easements, building permits, and financial or other legal
arrangements to be made with the MBTA, the Cambridge Conservation
Commission, the City, private landowner(s), and other parties (the “Bridge
Approvals”). For a period of three years after the adoption of the AOD-1
Zoning and no challenge to the validity of the same having been made (or
in the event of any challenge, such challenge having been finally resolved
in favor of such validity), the Proponent will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Bridge Approvals. The Proponent will work
collaboratively with the MBTA and the City to transfer ownership of the
Alewife Public Bridge to the City through a formal acceptance process
approved by the City in accordance with all City and State ordinances and
laws. If, despite its exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, the
Proponent has not obtained the Bridge Approvals within such three-year
period, the Proponent will contribute the then-current estimated cost of the
constructing the Alewife Public Bridge in accordance with the Bridge Plans
(as may have been modified as provided in Section A.5(iii), such estimate
to be provided by Rosales Partners or other designer pursuant to Section

A.5(iii), and which estimate will be reasonably reviewed and approved by
the City of Cambridge) to the City, provided, however, that the Proponent’s
funding obligation under this Section A.5(iv) shall not be less $10,000,000
and shall not exceed $15,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Proponent’s funding obligations under Section A.5(iii), if any, are in
addition to the obligations under this Section A.5(iv) and would be
delivered to the City concurrently, i.e., if the Bridge Plans have been
modified to accommodate a clear width greater than 16 feet then the
Proponent’s maximum funding obligation under this Section A.5(iv) would
be $17,000,000. Upon delivery of the funds required under this Section
A.5(iv) the Proponent’s obligations for the Alewife Public Bridge shall be
fully satisfied and all of the Proponent’s obligations under this Section A.5
would be of no further force and effect.
v. If the Bridge Approvals are obtained within such three-year period (the date
of the final such approval being the “Bridge Approval Date”), then the
Proponent shall commence construction of the Alewife Public Bridge not
later than twelve months from the Bridge Approval Date, provided,
however, that the adjacent building on the Property has been issued its
building permit. The adjacent building on the Property connected to the
Alewife Public Bridge shall be included in the first phase of the Project, and
the Proponent shall construct all the components of the Alewife Public
Bridge located on the Property concurrently with the construction of the
adjacent building. The Proponent’s funding obligation to the portion of the
Alewife Public Bridge within the MBTA ROW shall not exceed
$15,000,000, plus the amount, if any, under Section A.5(iii). The Proponent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete construction of the
Alewife Public Bridge within thirty (30) months of commencement of its
construction, and no further Certificates of Occupancy shall be issued after
such thirty (30) month period, unless the Alewife Public Bridge
construction is complete.
6. Cambridge Highlands.
i. The Project’s Site Massing Plan will adhere and be subject to the height
step-downs of Section 20.95.2 of the Zoning Ordinance that limit the height
of buildings proximate to the Cambridge Highlands residential
neighborhood.
ii. The Project will not include any building within 50 feet of the open space
or residential zoning districts of the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood or
the townhouses along Loomis Street that are not in a residential district (the
“No Build Zone”).

vii. The Project will adhere the Envision Alewife Plan’s recommendations for
independent hydrology studies, flood plain mitigation, and best practices
for onsite maintenance of these elements of the Project, as the same are
conditions of the Project’s Conservation Commission Order of Conditions
and/or its Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit.
viii. The Proponent will complete shadow studies of the Project and share these
studies with the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood and review the studies
with the City.
ix. The Project will include areas for bicycle storage and bicycle sharing
programs, as required by the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.
x. The Project will comply with all applicable City of Cambridge Ordinances,
rules, regulations, and policies including but not limited to, noise reduction,
minimizing light “spillage” facing the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood,
trash removal and delivery, and building mechanical screening, which will
be more particularly outlined in the Project’s Quadrangle Northwest Master
Plan Proposal.
xi. Rooftop mechanical screening shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet in
height.
xii. The Project will be managed professionally by reputable property
management firm(s) that can be contacted at any time.
xiii. Prior to groundbreaking on the first phase of the Project, the Proponent will
undertake non-destructive, pre-construction surveys of potentially impacted
residential homes. The purpose of these surveys will be to establish a
mutually agreed upon baseline condition of the nearby Cambridge

Highlands homes so that any potential impacts due to construction activities
are easily identifiable.
xiv. Prior to groundbreaking on the first phase of the Project, the Proponent will
develop its contractor’s construction management plan (“CMP”) with
representatives of the Cambridge Highlands neighborhood. The CMP will
include (a) an Integrated Pest Management (“IPM”) program with an
ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or
their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological
control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of
resistant varieties, and (b) a dust control plan to control and minimize all
sources of dust, especially dust from hazardous materials and soil, with
appropriate protection for workers and abutters in windy weather
conditions.
xv. At request from members of the community, the Proponent will be
reasonably available to share Project plans and progress of items outlined
in this letter.
B. Additional Conditions to the Proponent’s Commitments.
1. The Proponent’s commitments set forth above are subject to the following
condition: the amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance set forth in the
AOD-1 Zoning are duly adopted in the form attached hereto, and no challenge to
the validity of the same shall have been made (or in the event of any challenge,
such challenge shall have been finally resolved in favor of such validity.)
C. Conclusion.
1. The Proponent is willing to make the payments and contributions and other
mitigation referenced herein to provide resources to mitigate any potential impacts
of the Modifications to Standards defined in AOD-1 Zoning Section 20.930.4 (e.g.,
additional FAR and increased commercial building height) which might result from
the Project if the Proponent elects to develop the Project or a portion of the Project
in accordance with the AOD-1 Zoning and any Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan
Special Permit(s) granted therefore.
2. The Proponent understands and agrees that the commitments made in this letter
shall be binding upon Proponent and all successor owners of the Property or any
part thereof, and that this letter will be made part of and be incorporated wholly by
reference into the Zoning Ordinance.
3. As the Proponent’s duly authorized representative, I am pleased to commit to this
significant mitigation on the Proponent’s behalf.

(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of
eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2,
Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district,
provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any nonresidential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and
other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is
planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or
consumer-facing uses businesses that require light industrial space but also include a
consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy
Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the
Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited
number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to provide neighborhood
amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any

Example Housing Text:
Required Residential Development.
(1) At least forty percent (40%) of the total permitted GFA in a Master Plan shall be devoted to
residential use as listed in Section 4.31, Paragraphs a. through h. of this Zoning Ordinance. Such
calculation shall be based on GFA authorized exclusive of any GFA devoted solely to structured parking.
(2) The Master Plan shall include a Phasing Plan providing a general sequence for the construction of
residential and non-residential uses. The Planning Board shall approve such a Phasing Plan if it is found
to ensure that residential uses will be completed on a schedule that meets the objectives of the City and
ensures compliance with the requirement set forth in Paragraph (1) above. Non-residential
development on a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel shall not exceed, in the aggregate, sixty
percent (60%) of the total non-exempt GFA permitted for non-residential uses until substantial
construction activity of a significant portion of the required residential GFA within the Master Plan has
commenced. Full completion of all of the permitted non-residential GFA shall not be allowed before
substantial construction activity has commenced on all of the required residential GFA. The Planning
Board may approve variations to the standards in this Paragraph if the Phasing Plan is found to be in
general conformance with the intent of this Paragraph.

City Council; Clerk
City Manager
You've been served, Thank you: Call to action to serve our nation

Dear City Councilors and Clerk Wilson:
Cambridge residents need your help- to fulfill your duty as our representatives to stand up for Truth vs. Treason:

PURSUANT TO 18 USC 4, AND 18 USC 2382, we are hereby serving you LEGAL NOTICE
of felonies that have been committed, that you are required to acknowledge. If you fail or
refuse to, your act of omission will be construed as "aiding and abetting" these crimes, and you
will be considered a party in these crimes, and stripped of your authority/office, and this material
will be sent to the federal court for prosecution. Again, you have been given LEGAL
NOTICE. We will expect a notice and report by you describing your response within a
week. Failure to do this will result in a criminal and civil legal action against you in your personal
and corporate capacities.
Thank You in advance for any help you can provide regarding such a critical matter. To assist you in this landmark effort
by citizens across America, I shared with you (or tried to) in an earlier email this evening (which I tried resending, since
the file that I tried to share on Monday apparently could not be accessed) a large PDF file to accompany the notice
above, regarding crimes or at least irregularities committed against America. The file enumerates myriad instances of
crucial, strategic irregularities in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, especially (also perhaps in elections at other levels
of government), regarding which up to two thousand affidavits have been submitted across our nation. Tens of millions
of American citizens now require that these irregularities be thoughtfully considered on the basis of their substance /
merits, so that all paper ballots cast and the entire election process can be investigated through a COMPLETE,
TRANSPARENT FORENSIC AUDIT for the election results to be rectified if found to have been substantially compromised
-- also that no executive orders issued by the Biden administration be implemented or enforced until the 2020 elections
have been comprehensively investigated, since the 2020 elections have been so fraught with reasonable questions and
thus controversy, even amongst expert analysts at the highest levels of technology and our military-- when they have
been courageous enough / sufficiently UNcompromised to speak out. In fact, the 37 executive orders now passed by
the current Administration indicate that America is now being governed by diktat rather than by representation-- a
concept that Joe Biden himself had voiced:

https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021
If you have not received or cannot access the file that I have tried to share this week, please advise ASAP so I can mail
or bring a hard copy of the file to Clerk's office.
As I noted in an earlier email this week, there is more to the U.S. Constitution than process: Although "process" may
have been "followed" (according to letter rather than the spirit of the law?) in recent months regarding cases of election
fraud submitted to courts, the substance of most cases has not (yet) been respected for the rule of law to be applied
for the MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THIS CENTURY to come before the Supreme Court of the United States-- which is

outrageous, appalling, and frankly terrifying to many of us Americans. I therefore very much appreciate Mayor
Siddiqui's so graciously calling on me to speak during this past Monday evening's City Council meeting (which was GREAT
Customer Service for the City, btw-- much as I would expect from Mayor Siddiqui, who has very favorably impressed me
in so many ways, so many times, these past few years...in fact, I was quite conflicted about raising election issues locally,
not wanting to require more work from anyone in our community during this pandemic...but you all are fortunate
indeed to be fully employed-- and this issue that I am raising is crucial for our nation's continuation as a constitutional
republic), despite Clerk Wilson's having informed me earlier that in his estimation, my item was not on the meeting
agenda (in fact, regarding that: might I respectfully suggest/request that any/all rules re: Public Comment during City
Council meetings or hearings specify clearly and precisely--for increased transparency and
also the Good Customer Service that City Manager DePasquale has advocated, so wisely and strongly- WHICH particular categories/sections of your Agenda documents posted online relating to City Council meetings -e.g., the Agenda Summary and Agenda Packet -- do and do NOT qualify a resident for offering a public comment
during a City Council meeting-- for better Customer Service, going forward).
In fact, during the Cambridge City Council meeting's Public Comments period last Monday evening, I was simply doing
what many courts of law have been doing recently by dismissing cases about election irregularities for being too early /
"not ripe" --and THEN, when those same cases were submitted a little later, dismissing them for being too late /
"moot": conveniently taking advantage of certain terms' IMprecision. So- I took that same liberty, assuming that if no
category of City Council AGENDA docs is clearly DISqualified for public comment (according to any criteria that I could
quickly and easily find, at least...if certain qualification rules are so critical for Cambridge residents' participation in City
Council meetings, I would think they'd be posted prominently at the top of the Meeting Portal web page for all to see-doesn't that seem reasonable to you?), then that issue MIGHT be open to Cambridge residents' own nuanced
interpretation-- similar to court judges' apparent discretion/ freedom to interpret matters as “not ripe” or “moot” if no
OPTIMAL or PRECISE timing has ever been specified for legal cases' submission... which seems to be a gaping loophole
that needs to be fixed to address this possibly most crucial issue in our nation’s history (and other matters, going
forward): to protect free and fair U.S. elections. Americans throughout this nation, like me, are increasingly becoming
sufficiently frustrated and incensed about current "process" to finally step up at the local level to better ensure that all
pieces of evidence are thoughtfully, carefully considered in recognition of the tremendous consequence-- the supreme
importance-- that they represent for us all:

Update Re: You've been served, Thank you: Call to action to serve our nation

Hello:
Please confirm that you received and can access the referenced PDF (file name: 2020 ELECTION FRAUD EVIDENCEcompressed.pdf -- a document of 236 pages...which I do wish the source had edited: some pages appear to be
duplicates, others specify only a broken link, and sometimes a blank page should have been included to ensure the
following section would begin on an odd-numbered / right-hand page. Hopefully the substance is sufficient to do the job
of securing a transparent, comprehensive forensic audit of the 2020 election process in our locale, including voting
machines, memory cards, and all ballots cast).
UPDATE: The New Hampshire House Election Law Committee voted UNANIMOUSLY 20-0 on SB 43 to send to the
full House "legislation outlining a full, detailed audit by a team of experts of the Nov. 3 election results in the
town of Windham" --of the Diebold Accuvote voting machines in Windham, NH, since Republican candidates
(who had won election) were found to have been cheated out of 300 votes per candidate. (This legislation might
be called the Gardner Amendment; it is supported by Secretary of State William Gardner.)

WHEREAS:

Food waste presents a serious environmental problem when organic matter is thrown
out, as decomposing food waste that ends up in landfills releases methane that is 25
times more efficient at trapping heat as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide; and

WHEREAS:

Composting food waste is a greener alternative that could eliminate roughly 5,300 tons
of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year if 100 mid-sized, sit-down restaurants
participated in it; and

WHEREAS:

Many other municipalities across the country, including San Francisco, Denver, and
Portland, Oregon have created commercial food waste composting programs to divert
all organic waste from trash waste streams, and Cambridge could develop a similar
commercial composting program for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees,
with the potential to expand to larger businesses if successful; and

WHEREAS:

By helping restaurants save on trash fees, redirecting food waste from landfills,
offering local farms in need of sustainable alternatives to industrial fertilizer, and
allowing us to easily track the amount of diverted food waste, a Commercial
Composting Pilot Program would simultaneously support our small business
community and local farmers while reducing the City’s environmental footprint; and

WHEREAS:

Implementing a Commercial Composting Pilot Program would align with the Envision
Cambridge goals of “[minimizing] waste generation and [eliminating] landfill waste,”
and “[ensuring] local businesses of different types, sizes, and growth stages are able to
start, grow, and remain in Cambridge”; and

WHEREAS:

This Commercial Composting Pilot Program should be designed and marketed with an
eye towards creating equitable opportunities for small businesses, especially those
owned by minorities, women, or other historically disadvantaged groups; and

WHEREAS:

As this program will likely have budget implications similar to the 2018 Small
Business Recycling Pilot, this possibility should be examined before the next fiscal
year begins; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:

One important aspect of this vibrant history that the City should also be striving to

Memorandum Regarding Proposed Ordinance
Restricting Use Of Chemical Riot Control Agents and Kinetic Impact Projectiles
I.

Authority of the Cambridge City Council to Pass the Ordinance
A.

General

The main authority for the City of Cambridge to pass ordinances regulating its police
force is found in G.L. c. 41, § 97, which plainly states that “selectmen may make suitable
regulations governing the police department and the officers thereof.” Under G.L. c. 40, § 21,
“[t]owns may … make such ordinances and by-laws, … as they may judge most conducive to
their welfare” which may include ordinances “(1) For directing and managing their prudential
affairs, preserving peace and good order, and maintaining their internal police.” (emphasis
added). See Thibeault v. Chief of Police of Fitchburg, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 364 (1977) (it is to
the city council that the legislature has committed the decision as to the proper operation of
police department); Chief of Police of Westford v. Westford, 365 Mass. 526, 532 (1974) (same).
In addition, “Towns [and cities] may . . . make such ordinances and by-laws, not
repugnant to law, as they may judge most conducive to their welfare, which shall be binding
upon all inhabitants thereof and all persons within their limits. . . (1) For directing and
managing their prudential affairs, preserving peace and good order, and maintaining their
internal police.” See G.L. c. 40, § 21 (emphasis added). This gives the City of Cambridge the
authority to pass an ordinance curtailing action by any actor so long as the act occurs within city
limits. This ordinance can be likened to the town of Amherst’s ban on certain firearms in 1981,
which was upheld by the Supreme Judicial Court in Town of Amherst v. Attorney General, 398
Mass. 793, 796 (1986) (“It is fundamental that every presumption is to be made in favor of the
validity of municipal by-laws”) (“towns have the power to pass by-laws for the purpose of
preserving peace and order”).
Further, “[a]ny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment or repeal of local
ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to
confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general
court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court . . . and which is not denied, either
expressly or by clear implication, to the city or town by its charter.” G.L. c. 43A, § 13. This
suggests that, with limited exceptions not applicable to this situation, the Cambridge City
Council may pass ordinances that are not “inconsistent” with state law or the Massachusetts
constitution.
An ordinance will be valid unless there is a state or local law with clear legislative intent
to preclude local action. Id. While there is one state law that comes close to the issue of whether
Cambridge could ban other police entities from using certain tactics, that law is distinguishable.
Specifically, G.L. c. 41, § 98 provides “[t]he chief and other police officers of all cities and
towns . . . may carry within the commonwealth such weapons as the chief of police or the board
or officer having control of the police in a city or town shall determine; provided, that any law
enforcement officer of another state or territory of the United States may, while on official
business within the Commonwealth, carry such weapons as are authorized by his appointing
authority.” There is a distinction between carrying and using such weapons.

Attachment: Legal Memorandum re Cambridge Tear Gas Ordinance (POR 2021 #51 : Restricting the Use of Chemical Crowd Control Agents and

7.8.a

1
Packet Pg. 545

Nor is § 98 in “sharp conflict” with the proposed ordinance. In Town of Amherst v.
Attorney Gen., the Supreme Judicial Court considered a by-law passed by the town of Amherst
prohibiting the use of certain firearms. 502 N.E.2d at 130–31. The regulations were challenged
as conflicting with state laws regulating hunting and the safe use of certain firearms. The court
held that Amherst’s by-law did not conflict with the state law regulating firearms because no
section of state law was “inconsistent with the by-law,” that the by-law did not “frustrate[]” any
sections of state law, and concluding that ‘[t]he mere existence of [a] state provision for some
matters within the purview of the by-law will not render [the by-law] invalid as repugnant to
law.” Id.
B.

Authority To Regulate State And Federal State Law Enforcement Officers

In general, a police officer lacks authority to act outside his or her jurisdiction, unless
specifically authorized by statute. See Commonwealth v. Savage, 430 Mass. 341, 343–346
(1999). The clear implication of this principle is that police officers operating within the City of
Cambridge, under the authority of the Cambridge Police Department, are therefore subject to the
same statutory mandates as any Cambridge police officer would be. The Massachusetts State
Police Rules of Conduct support the conclusion that state troopers are subject to ordinances
governing the City of Cambridge. See State Police Rules of Conduct, Rule 5.4.1 (“Members shall
obey all laws of the United States and of any country, state, or local jurisdiction in which the
members are present.”).
The authority to regulate federal authorities is less clear. The United States District Court
for the District of Colorado this past Spring issued a temporary restraining order enjoining “the
City and County of Denver, and specifically the Denver Police Department and officers from
other jurisdictions who are assisting Denver Officers, from employing chemical weapons or
projectiles of any kind against persons engaging in peaceful protests or demonstrations.” Abay v.
City of Denver, No. 12-cv-01616-RBJ, ECF No. 16 (D. Col. June 5, 2020) (emphasis added).
The Court also specifically ordered that “Non-Denver officers shall not use any demonstration of
force or weapon beyond what Denver itself authorizes for its own officers. Any non-Denver
officer permitted to or directed to be deployed to the demonstrations shall be considered an agent
of Denver such that Denver shall ensure such officer is limiting their use of force to that
authorized by the Defendant.” Id.
II.

Severability

The severability clause included in the ordinance will ensure that if a portion of the
ordinance is successfully challenged, the remainder of the ordinance will remain in effect. When
courts sustain a challenge to part of a piece of legislation, the invalid portion is severed, saving
the remainder, “unless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions
which are within its power, independently of that which is not.” I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919,
931-32 (1983). See also Peterson v. Commissioner of Revenue, 444 Mass. 128, 137-28 (2005)
(“When a court is compelled to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute and is obliged to
declare part of it unconstitutional, the court, as far as possible, will hold the remainder to be
constitutional and valid, if the parts are capable of separation and are not so intertwined that the
Legislature could not have intended that the part otherwise valid should take effect without the
invalid part.”). Where, as here, it is the intent of the drafters to ensure that the ordinance remain

Attachment: Legal Memorandum re Cambridge Tear Gas Ordinance (POR 2021 #51 : Restricting the Use of Chemical Crowd Control Agents and

7.8.a

2
Packet Pg. 546

valid should any portion be invalidated, a severability clause unambiguously conveys that
legislative intent to a reviewing court. I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. at 932.
III.

Private Right Of Action

Sections 6 and 7 of the Massachusetts Home Rule Amendment (“HRA”), Article 89 of
the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, allow a city or town to adopt local
ordinances without prior approval of the state legislature as long as those ordinances are not
inconsistent with the state constitution or laws passed by the state legislature. In particular, HRA
§ 7(5) states that a city may “enact private or civil law governing civil relationships [which is] an
incident to an exercise of an independent municipal power ....” As our Supreme Judicial Court
has often stated, “§ 6 of the HRA undoubtedly grants municipalities broad powers to adopt bylaws for the protection of the public health, morals, safety, and general welfare, of a type often
referred to as the ‘police’ power.” CHR Gen., Inc. v. Newton, 387 Mass. 351, 355 (1982).
In Marshal House, Inc. v. Rent Review & Grievance Bd., 357 Mass. 709, 718 (1970), the
court stated that the language of HRA § 7(5), required “viewing separately the various
component powers making up the broad police power, with the consequence that a municipal
civil law regulating a civil relationship is permissible (without prior legislative authorization)
only as an incident to the exercise of some independent, individual component of the municipal
police power.” That requirement is clearly met by the statutory grant of authority to city or town
selectmen to make “suitable regulations governing the police department and the officers
thereof” under G.L. c. 41, § 97.
Moreover, our courts have held that police officers, in accepting employment by the
public, implicitly agree that they will not engage in conduct which calls into question their ability
and fitness to perform their official responsibilities and that they may face discipline and liability
if they fail to do so by violating laws designed to regulate police conduct. See Police Com'r of
Boston v. Civil Service Com'n, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 371 (1986); McIsaac v. Civil Service
Com'n, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 473 (1995) (Police officer discharged for violating department
regulation prohibiting conduct unbecoming an officer by negligently handling firearm while
intoxicated and verbally abusing other officers); City of Boston v. Boston Police Patrolmen's
Association, 477 Mass. 434 (2017) (discussion of choke holds and protection of public from
excessive use of force by police).
Further, there is “no case law of significance” that states that municipalities may not
create private rights of action consistently with the Home Rule Amendment to the Massachusetts
Constitution. See generally Paul A. Diller, The City and the Private Right of Action, 64 Stan. L.
Rev. 1109, 1167 & n.319 (2012). In the absence of such law, the proposed ordinance can
include a private right of action.

WHEREAS:

COVID-19 new cases per day have stabilized at dangerous levels and even slightly
increased after declining from a peak in early January 2021; and

WHEREAS:

There continues to be a significant disparity in both case and death rates between Black
and white residents of Cambridge; and

WHEREAS:

Cambridge followed Governor Baker’s lead in reopening to a modified version of
Phase 3, Stage 2 of the statewide reopening plan as of March 1, 2021, with plans to
further reopen on March 22, 2021 including large indoor performance venues; and

WHEREAS:

At their February 17, 2021 meeting, the Expert Advisory Panel discussed how to
communicate the “looming risk” of a variant surge associated with severe disease in
higher risk groups by stating that in order to maintain the same risk level they have
right now, people will need to take more precautions; and

WHEREAS:

New COVID-19 variants that have emerged are more infectious and deadly than the
original virus, and some are even able to reduce the efficacy of the new vaccines; and

WHEREAS:

A study published by the CDC on March 5, 2021 concluded that “policies that require
universal mask use and restrict any on-premises restaurant dining are important
components of a comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure to and transmission of
SARS-CoV-2”; and

WHEREAS:

Both CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci have stressed to
Governors and the public on numerous occasions that moving too fast to ease limits
could undo progress in the effort to limit transmission; and

WHEREAS:

Somerville remains in a limited version of Phase 3, Step 1 which includes 25%
capacity restrictions for indoor dining and no plans to open large venues; and

WHEREAS:

The state’s vaccine distribution rollout has been a disappointment and so far only about
10% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated, with a lower vaccine uptake
among vulnerable communities due to the same structural issues that drive up COVID19 rates in these communities in the first place; and

WHEREAS:

Reopening large indoor performance venues at 50% capacity would allow for indoor
gatherings of potentially hundreds of people in some spaces where alcohol
consumption is permitted; now therefore be it

Packet Pg. 549

7.9

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to reverse his decision to open large
indoor performance venues on March 22, 2021 until widespread vaccination of the
general public is achieved in the coming weeks and adequate safety guidance can be
implemented to protect workers, performance goers, and Cambridge residents ; and be
it further

ORDERED:

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to reimplement capacity restrictions
on indoor dining to ensure the safety of restaurant workers, diners, and Cambridge
residents until widespread vaccination of the general public is achieved in the coming
weeks; and be it further

RESOLVED:

That the City Council go on record renewing its desire for data and scientific research
to drive pandemic decision making in Cambridge

Cambridge City Council
Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor
March 11th, 2021
Communicating information from the School Committee

To the Honorable, the City Council:
On Friday, March 5th, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education adopted amendments to
the Student Learning Time regulations 603 CMR 27.08(2)(d) on an emergency basis, giving
Commissioner Riley the authority to determine when hybrid and remote learning models will no longer
count toward meeting the required student learning time hours. Commissioner Riley made the following
announcements on Tuesday, March 9th (the full guidance is here):
• For elementary schools (grades K-5), hybrid and remote learning models will no longer count
towards meeting the required student learning time hours as of Monday, April 5th, 2021. As a
result, districts and schools are required to shift their learning model to full-time, in-person
instruction, five days a week, for elementary grade levels, effective Monday, April 5th, 2021
•

For middle schools (grades 6-8), hybrid and remote learning models will no longer count
towards meeting the required student learning time hours as of Wednesday, April 28th, 2021. As a
result, districts and schools are required to shift their learning model to full-time, in-person
instruction, five days a week, for middle school grade levels, Monday, April 28th, 2021

•

For high schools (grades 9-12), details and timing will be announced next month. Districts will
be notified at least two weeks in advance of the date that high school students must return to fulltime, in-person instruction. Districts are being told to prepare plans now

Families will still have the choice for a fully remote option and should be asked about their preference for
this expansion. Physical distancing between students should be at least 3 feet in classrooms and 6 feet
Packet Pg. 551

8.1

during mealtimes, while adults should maintain 6 feet of distancing between students and other staff when
feasible.
While the regulations and documentation do not present much flexibility, we are working to get answers
from DESE as quickly as possible and we hope to have more information very soon about next steps. CPS
has been expanding in-person learning successfully with the implementation of our student surveillance
testing and all of our infection control protocols.

Governor Baker has announced additional details about vaccine appointments available to K-12 staff.
Anyone who is employed on a full or part-time basis by CPS is now eligible, including educators,
paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative staff, custodial staff, food-service staff, safety staff,
administrators, bus drivers and monitors, and those employed by another organization to provide
education or support in a school setting. IDs will not be necessary, and eligibility will be confirmed by
signing a form when appointments are booked or during check-in.
CPS staff can be vaccinated at CVS locations, their healthcare provider, hospital, or community health
center, and at any of the state’s 170 public vaccination sites. There will be designated “K-12 staff days”
on Saturday, March 27th, Saturday, April 3rd, Saturday April 10th, and Sunday April 14th at these 8 sites
(pre-registration using the state’s system is required):
• Eastfield Mall in Springfield
• Natick Mall in Natick
• Gillette Stadium in Foxboro
• Reggie Lewis Center in Roxbury
• Former Circuit City in Dartmouth
• Fenway Park in Boston (through 3/27)
• Hynes Convention Center in Boston (starting 3/18)
It is estimated that it will take a month for all eligible individuals to secure a first appointment due to a
“severely constrained federal supply and the existing population that is currently eligible for vaccines”.
On Wednesday, March 10th, CPS was granted access to 100 vaccines through the Cambridge Health
Alliance with the requirement that they would be administered within the following two days. CPS, in
conjunction with the Cambridge Public Health Department, made the decision to offer these doses on a
first-come-first-serve basis to food services staff, custodians, maintenance, and safety specialist staff.
The new tentative MCAS administration dates for grades 3-8 this spring are:
• May 19th – June 11th for grades 3, 4, 5 ELA, Math, and STE
• TBD for grades 6, 7, 8
I am excited to share that we have begun to receive applications for the position of Interim Superintendent
of the Cambridge Public Schools. On Friday, March 12th, the Ad-Hoc Superintendent Search
Subcommittee will convene in Executive Session with Chief Talent Officer Lisa Richardson for a
preliminary screening of applicants. I serve as the Chair of this subcommittee and I am joined by

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: March 15, 2021

COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS
COUNCILLOR NOLAN:
1. Some city staff have been working throughout the pandemic, and some have had some
additional work, and some have had curtailed work due to office restrictions and
quarantines. Now that the City and Commonwealth are able to see the light at the end
of the tunnel, what can we expect for restoration of city services? As an example, the
City extended resident parking permits, but the delay hasn’t been explained. Some
paid for permits 8 weeks ago and have yet to receive them - hopefully that will be
resolved soon. What city services have a backlog and when can we expect operations
to be relatively normal?
2. As people return to work, and more commuting, we need people to feel safe using
public transit, since the pandemic has led to increased single occupancy vehicle trips,
which is detrimental from a number of perspectives. How is the city communicating
with the MBTA about the best way to handle the migration of folks back to work?
Besides requiring masks, have they been working to gear up their schedules to have
more frequent service to avoid crowding? Will they use their T ambassadors to help
ensure mask wearing and distancing? Will local companies do anything focused on safe,
distanced transportation once they start calling folks back into the office?
MAYOR SIDDIQUI:
1. What is the status of CPH reaching homebound individuals with vaccines?
2. As more vaccine supply becomes available with the hope that local municipalities
regain more access, how and where would CPH host community vaccination sites?
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY:
1. With recent approval and increased production of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19
vaccine, when will we start to see it available in the Cambridge community, and is the
lower efficacy rate a concern?
