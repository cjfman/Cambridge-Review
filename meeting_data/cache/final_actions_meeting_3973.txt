COMMENT
GENERAL
Is a minor amendment required for the additional floor area associated with the bridges?
1.

RESPONSE

PAGE REF

CLOSED

Yes - The Gross Floor Area (GFA) of the bridges within Lot G exceed the maximum GFA allocated for Lot G by
more than 10% of the approved figure. Approval of the pedestrian bridges would be conditional with approval
of Minor Amendment #9 for the increased GFA approved on Lot G.

2.

If a minor amendment is required, the Appendix I will need to be updated to reflect the reduction of commecial GFA on other
parcels.

Yes - An updated Appendix I has been submitted which contemplates the approval of the pedestrian bridges and
reductions to commercial GFA allocated to future commecial development lots.

3.

What are the widths of the bridges?

Both bridges are 14'-0" from outside face of glass to outside face of glass

4.

We typically avoid pedestrian bridges because they draw activity away from the public releam.

5.

The façade treatment and articulation is too dull:

We believe that the functional use of the pedestrian bridges for work-related collaboration, communication, and
inter-departmental interactions will not detract from the vibrate public realm in the immediate area and the larger
community at Cambridge Crossing.
Additional information related to the façade has been developed and submitted for review.

a.

Can the glass be more transparent?

Yes - We have changed glass based on staff comments and selected the1 1/8" IGU (High-VLT Insulated Glazing
Unit) which was the same glass used at the main building lobby's curtainwall to address previous CDD
transparency concerns. This glass will be used as the vision glass for both pedestrian bridges.

b.

Can the structure be expressed more?

Yes - We have changed the paint finish on the structure based on staff comments. The exposed structure will be
primed and painted to match the darker, Pewter color of the curtainwall mullions. This will contrast with the ultratransparent glass and light shadowbox color to make it more apparent. The change to a more transparent glass
will help express the structure when viewed from the ground plane.

c.

The spandrels appear too dull:

Further development related to the spandrels has been developed and submitted for review.

i.

What is the spandrel material?

The spandrels are glass with a painted metal shadow box back panel. The glass material is the same as noted in
5a above and the color of the painted metal shadow box back panel is UC1345XL Duranar XL white silver (3
coat) using UC51742 Primer & UC134595 clear-coat. This finish is similar to the vertical fins of Building H and the
horizontal sun shades of Parcel G.

ii.

Can the spandrels be thinner?

Yes - In response to staff comments we reduced the vertical dimension of the spandrel and increased the amount
of vision glass. We were able to reduce the top spandrel dimension from 3'-3 1/2" to 2'-7 1/2" - a reduction of
8" (19.23%). We were able to reduce the bottom spandrel dimension from 3'-7 1/2" to 3'-4 1/2" - a reduction
of 3" (6.9%).
The underside of the bridges are composite metal panel.
Yes - We have changed the metal panel finish based on staff comments and selected three coats of Valspar
399C049 Fluropon Classic II - Pewter
All the renderings shared during our staff meeting were of Building G and Building H views published and
submitted with previous design review filings.
Yes - In response to staff comments we have included the additional requested rendered view.

6.

What is the material of the underside of the bridges?
a.
Can the color of the metal panel on the underside of the bridges be a lighter color?

7.

I'm curious what the view would look like if you were standing on the sidewalk in the middle of the service drive looking up?
a.

Can you produce an additional rendering of that view?

8.

Will lighting be consistent on both bridges?

9.

Will there be any exterior lighting?

10.

Will there be any large light fixtures on the interior of the bridge?

Yes - The lighting will be standard interior office down lighting intended only to provide safe pedestrian travel
across the bridges. There will be no exterior or decorative lighting.
No - We will not be introducing any exterior lighting on the pedestrian bridges.
No - The lighting will be standard interior office down lighting intended only to provide safe pedestrian travel
across the bridges.

Addendum to Pedestrian Wind Study Report
Parcels G and H – Northpoint Site
RWDI Reference No. 1703124

Dear Kevin,

Communication: CX_20210921 (General Business)

Re:

Image 2) Chemical facility to the northeast corner of Parcel G

Rowan Williams Davies & Irwin Inc. (RWDI) was retained in 2017 to assess the pedestrian wind
conditions for the proposed Parcels G and H of Northpoint Site in Cambridge, MA, in 2017. The results
of that study were presented in a report issued on September 26, 2017.
RWDI has since reviewed updated information for Parcel G and Parcel H which was received on March 1,
and May 4, 2021. The intent of the present report is to comment on the impact of the design changes on
the wind conditions predicted from the wind tunnel test conducted in 2017.
Most significant design changes to Parcel G and Parcel H include:
•

Coniferous plantings along the north elevations of both Parcels G and H (Images 1a and 1b);

•

Addition of chemical facilities to the northeast corner of Parcel G, which is surrounded by a 29ft
tall fence (see Image 2); and,

•

Image 3) Two bridges connecting Parcels H and G (2021 update design)

Two bridges connecting Parcels G and H at Levels 3 and 9 (see Image 3).
The service area between the two parcels is expected to experience occasional uncomfortable wind
conditions during the winter. The upper bridge at Level 9 will not have any wind impact on the ground
level. The lower bridge at Level 3 creates a more confined area, which may accelerate winds slightly
more in the area underneath the bridge. The addition of the chemical storage facility at northeast
corner of Parcel G is a positive design feature which could help to reduce wind speeds in this area. In
addition to the wind speed reduction resulting from the chemical storage facility, the design teams have
proposed landscaping and planting features that will also help to reduce the wind speeds. These
features include a number of canopy trees to the south as well as coniferous/evergreen trees to the
north of both Parcels G and H. The design teams have taken measures to enhance the pedestrian
experience by locating pedestrian entrances and points of interest away from the service drive between
Parcels G and H. It is our understanding that this area will be a service area and driveway and is not
expected to be used for any prolonged activities; therefore the predicted higher wind speeds maybe

Image 1a) Landscaping plan of Parcel H

considered acceptable. If reduced wind speeds in this area are desired, additional localized wind control

Image 1b) Landscaping plan of Parcel G

features can be incorporated to reduce wind speeds to acceptable levels.

Re:

To Whom It May Concern:
This is to inform you that we have provided energy modeling services for this project to confirm
that the project meets the requirements of the Massachusetts "Stretch" Energy Code. Energy
modeling was performed using eQUEST v3.65 software in accordance with IECC 2015.
The results of the energy model show that the designed building uses 46.5% less energy than a
similar building that meets ASHRAE 90.1-2013 minimum requirements. This exceeds the
"Stretch" Code requirement of 10% energy savings. Attached is a summary of energy savings of
the design case as compared to the baseline (Code compliant) case.
If there are any questions, feel free to contact me at Adam_Jennings@aha-engineers.com.

an additional parking count of 1 space under either the Office and
Lab/R&D calculations. Of the 406 total spaces provided by the project,
29 spaces are currently fenced off for a future Cambridge Crossing
development. The project will allocate 2 of those 29 fenced‐off spaces
for the Bridge Connectors on Parcels G and H.

This project will have 12 standard + 4 van accessible parking spaces.
