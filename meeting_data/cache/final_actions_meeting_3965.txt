>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> THANK YOU, GOOD EVENING. I'M NEIL ROHR, I LIVE AT 655 CONCORD
CAVE IN CAMBRIDGE IN THE CAMBRIDGE HIGHLANDS. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT
OF ORDER OF 246. I LIVED HERE FOR TWO YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN A
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT SINCE 1974. I SEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN
CAMBRIDGE OVER THE YEARS, SINCE 1980S AND I ARGUE THAT PRIMARY
BENEFIT HAS ACCRUED TO DEVELOPERS AND FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS.
SECONDARILY, THERE'S BEEN BENEFIT IN TERMS OF INCREASED TAX REVENUE,
PRIMARILY FROM COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. WHICH RESULTED IN A
CONTROL OF THE TAX RATE.
THAT HAS BENEFITTED TAXPAYERS. THERE IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY HERE
TO COME UP WITH A GREAT PLAN THAT WILL FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, LIKE THE FINCH BUILDING NEAR WHERE I LIVE. 98 UNITS OF
BELOW MARKET HOUSING, AND LIVEABILITY, SUCH AS TRAFFIC, FLOODING,
DENSITY. INCREASE REVENUE DOESN'T NEED TO BE AND SHOULDN'T BE A
CONSIDERATION. THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO PASS THIS ORDER. I HOPE IT
WILL BE 9 0. AND THEN THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO CAUSE THE CITY
MANAGER AND THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO MOVE
QUICKLY AND TO CALL ALL LOCAL INTERESTS, SMALL BUSINESS, RESIDENTS OF
CAMBRIDGE HIGHLANDS AND SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DANICA MARI.
>> I LIVE AT 23 NORMANDY AVENUE IN CAMBRIDGE HIGHLANDS AND SPEAK
IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 246. WE HAVE A UNIQUE AND POWERFUL
OPPORTUNITY TO STRATEGICALLY PLAN THE QUADRANGLE SO IT IS A
SUSTAINABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK FOR DECADES. WE HAVE MANY
COMPETING INTERESTS FOR THIS AREA, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENT AND
ECOLOGY, HOUSING, INDUSTRY, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DEVELOPER
PROPHET. A STRATEGIC URBAN PLAN DESIGNED BY US, NOT A DEVELOPER,
WILL BALANCE THEM. AND THIS AREA DOES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED, BUT IT
NEEDS TO BE DONE THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY. THE EXISTING
INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT SUPPORT THE EXISTING TRAFFIC BURDEN, FOR
EXAMPLE. THIS ISSUE NEEDS EXTENSIVE STUDY AND INVESTMENT BEFORE
ANY DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS. AS DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS, THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO BOLSTER THE WEEK INTERNET AND AGING UTILITY
CONNECTIONS. THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE AREA IS VERY SENSITIVE. I LIVED
HERE FOR TEN YEARS AND I MOVED IN WITH A DRY BASEMENT. SIX OR SEVEN
YEARS AGO, HI TO PUT IN A FRENCH DRAIN SYSTEM WITH A POWERFUL SUMP
PUMP TO HANDLE THE WATER COMING IN. ANY DEVELOPMENT IN THE
QUAD WILL AFFECT THE WATER TABLE AND SHOULD BE STUDIED
THOROUGHLY. THE CURRENT QUAD ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T INCLUDE MUCH
GREEN SPACE OR TREES. GREEN SPACE AND TREES ARE KEY TO STABILIZING
THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE AREA IN ADDITION TO GIVING IT A
NEIGHBORHOOD FEEL AND KEEPING IT FROM BEING A HEAT ISLAND. THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THE QUAD MORE INVITING AND WELCOMING FEEL

PAGE 2

May 24, 2021

BY INCLUDING VARIOUS SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES, LIKE RESTAURANTS OR
COMMUNITY CENTER.
ENVISION ALEWIFE RECOMMENDS IT HAS A RANGE OF EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST LABS. IT TAKES PLANNING TO INCORPORATE THEM
INTO A COMMUNITY SO IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN INDUSTRIAL PARK.
SUMMARY, I ASK YOU TO PAUSE DEVELOPMENT UNTIL A SOLID PLAN IS IN
PLACE TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT IN A WAY TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY
FEEL AND BRING
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. FRANK KRAMER?
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: MY AUDIO WASN'T WORKING, BUT IT IS WORKING
NOW. I'M PRESENT AND AUDIBLE NOW.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. WE'LL RECORD YOU AS PRESENT AND AUDIBLE.
FRANK, GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M FRANK, A RESIDENT OF AVON STREET AND
FORMER OWNER OF A BUSINESS. CO FOUNDER AND BOARD MEMBER OF
CAMBRIDGE LOCAL FIRST. MY WORDS ARE NOT CONSTRUED AS A POSITION
OF CLS. THANK YOU COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK
TO YOU ABOUT ORDER 247 AND THE BIKE LANE PLAN GENERALLY. A PLAN OF
THIS MAGNITUDE AND OBVIOUS IMPACT ON RESIDENTS AND LOCAL
BUSINESSES SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN APPROVED WITHOUT A CITY WIDE
REFERENDUM THAT CAN BE SEEN AND VOTED ON BY EVERYBODY. I HEAR
COMMUNITY INPUT WAS ELICITED, BUT FOR STAKEHOLDERS CONCERN
REALLY CONSIDERED? I REFER YOU TO PAGE 9 OF THE ASSESSMENT OF
PORTER SQUARE, YOU WISELY ASKED MERCHANTS WHAT CHANGES NEED TO
OCCUR TO ATTRACT SHOPPERS. 70% LED THE RESPONSE WITH PARKING.
I ADMIT I ATTENDED TODAY'S COMMUNITY MEETING AND HEARD
DESPERATION FROM BUSINESS OWNERS ABOUT THE LOSS OF PARKING. I AND
MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS DO NOT OR CANNOT RIDE BICYCLES FOR
NUMEROUS REASONS. YOU ENCOURAGE US TO AGE IN PLACE. THIS PLAN IS
MAKING US FEEL AS THOUGH YOU RATHER SEE US LEAVE. SO, I SPEAK TODAY
IN SUPPORT A NEW PETITION FOR SAVE MASS AVENUE AND CALLS TO WORK
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO EVALUATE HOW THE PROJECT ACHIEVES GOALS
WITH COMPARISON OF BEFORE AND AFTER. THIS MANAGER SHOULD HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT HEADS TO AFFECT CHANGES.
I'M IN PARTIAL SUPPORT OF ORDER 247, AS IT ORDERS THE CITY MANAGER TO
WORK WITH TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT AND REPORT ON HOW PEOPLE WITH
LIMITED MOBILITY CAN ACCESS SERVICES ON MASS AVENUE AFTER THE BIKE
LANES ARE INSTALLED. THIS ACCESS MUST NOT BE ON SIDE STREETS WHERE
IT REPLACES RESIDENT PARKING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANN TENNIS.
>> I'M ANN TENNIS FROM GRISWOLD STREET AND SPEAK ON POLICY ORDER
246. I ASK THIS BE PASSED. THE CITY HAS BEEN MEETING FOR 40 YEARS WITH
THE GOAL OF CHANGING THE ZONING IN THE QUADRANGLE PART OF
ALEWIFE. MANY PLANS AND PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND NEVER


PAGE 3

May 24, 2021

IMPLEMENTED. WITH THE FINAL PLAN BEING THE ENVISION ALEWIFE
DISTRICT PLAN OF 2019. PLEASE PASS POLICY ORDER 246, WHICH SIMPLY
ASKS THAT THE QUADRANGLE BE ZONED WITH THE APPROPRIATE VENUES IN
CONSULTATION WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF THE HIGHLANDS QUAD
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION AND SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE
CITY.
SECOND COMMENT IS ON POLICY ORDER 247. PLEASE, PLEASE, DO NOT TAKE
AWAY PARKING SPACES ON ANY PART OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. WE
NEED TO SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE CITY. THIS PLAN WILL
DECIMATE THEM. INSTALL THE BIKE LANES, FINE. KEEP PARKING ON ALL
PARTS OF MASS AVENUE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE YOUNG KIM.
>> THEY HAVE WANT JOINED. NEXT PERSON, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M YENA DO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I LIVE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE AND I'M A
FOOT AND ANKLE SPECIALIST ON MASS AVENUE. I'M HERE TO ECHO THE
PLEASE FOR MY DISABLED PATIENTS. SOME OF US ARE BOUND TO
MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS DUE TO PHYSICAL CHALLENGES THAT DISABLE US.
WE ARE MENTALLY CHALLENGE AND COME FROM GROUP HOMES AND
DRIVEN BY THE DIRECTOR THAT CAN CONTAIN CAN KEEP AN EYE ON US.
SOME HAVE DISEASES AND COMORBIDITIES AND WE CAN'T TAKE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION. ALL OF US WILL GLADLY TRADE OUR DISABILITY FOR YOUR
ABILITIES. WE NEED PARKING ACCESS. IT IS CRUEL TO ALLOW THE RAIN OR
SNOW TO DRENCH ON THE DISABLED BODIES BECAUSE WE MOBILIZE SLOWER
AND HAVE TO PARK OUT FURTHER. WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DASH IN
AND OUT OF THE BUILDING. I WILL ECHO A PLEA FROM THE ABLED BODY
COMMUNITY, SOME ARE TRADES MEN AND HAVE TO CARRY TOOLS AND
EQUIPMENT. WE RELY UPON VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AND NEED PROTECTION
AND RELIABILITY DURING INCLIMATE WEATHER. BE INCLUSIVE IN THE
PLANNING. OUR CITY STRENGTH, SAFETY, AND SUCCESS RELY UPON
COLLABORATION, INCLUSION, AND UNITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ANN STEWART.
>> HI, I LIVE ON WHEELER STREET AND I'M ABUTTER OF PROPERTIES.
SMALL BUSINESSES, I THINK, ARE THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE CITY'S ECONOMY
AND WHEN THE COVID PANDEMIC STRUCK, THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE
ADMINISTRATION CAME TO THEIR AID, RIGHTFULLY SO. WELL, COVID IS STILL
GOING ON AND THEY HAVE BOUGHT 36 ACRES IN MY AREA. I THINK THERE'S
AT LEAST 26 LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT LEASE SPACE AND BUILDINGS THAT ARE
CONTROLLED BY HEALTH PEAK. AND THOSE SALARIES AND PROFITS STAY
LOCAL. THEY SAID CURRENT LAND IS DEFINED AS AN ACQUISITION OF
INCOME PRODUCING ASSET WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DENSIFY THE SITE AS
LEASES MATURE AND ENTITLEMENTS ARE RECEIVED. ONE QUESTION I HAVE,
HOW MANY OF THESE ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR PLACES OF BUSINESS WHEN
THEIR LEASES MATURE BECAUSE THE QUAD IS THEIR HOME, THEY CAN'T
MOVE TO KENDALL SQUARE. THE CAMBRIDGE DAY OF NOVEMBER 8
REPRODUCED A MAP OF THE PURCHASES IN THE QUAD. ONE MAP SAYS


PAGE 4

May 24, 2021

CONCORD AVENUE CAMPUS. I CAN'T FIND THE WORD CAMPUS IN MY
ALEWIFE DISTRICT PLAN HANDOUT OF DECEMBER 17, 2019. THE COUNCIL
ASKED CDD IN THE PAST TO FIND WAYS TO HELP NEIGHBORHOOD
ASSOCIATIONS. I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE YOU DEMONSTRATE YOUR
COMMITMENT TO THIS OBJECTIVE. I WANT A CITY RUN, PUBLIC PROCESS
STARTING NOW AND TRANSPARENCY WILL GET US A BETTER OUTCOME IN
THE LONG RUN THAN DIVIDE AND CONQUER AND PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS SHAWN MCCARRON.
>> SHAWN, IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> THANK YOU. I AM A BUSINESS OWNER AT 2374 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE
SINCE 2002. AND I AM A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AS OF THIS PAST WEEK,
HAD FIVE EMPLOYEES. I NOW HAVE THREE. TWO OF MY EMPLOYEES HAVE
DECIDED THAT DUE TO THE FACT THERE'S ZERO PARKING FOR BUSINESSES
AND ZERO PARKING FOR RESIDENTS, ZERO PARKING FOR EMPLOYEES, THEY
WILL MOVE TO OTHER LOCATIONS AND TAKE THEIR CLIENTS AS WELL.
THERE IS NO HANDICAP PARKING GOING TO BE HERE AT ALL ON THIS STRETCH
FROM ALBERTA TO DUDLEY. AND I WAS JUST SIMPLY SHOCKED TO SEE THAT
WE WERE JUST TOLD ONE DAY ACTUALLY TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE NEW
CONSTRUCTION. THEY HAVE ALREADY CHANGED THE SIGNS. THEY HAVE
ALREADY PAINTED AND MADE THEM I DO NOW HAVE NO PARKING
WHATSOEVER FOR MY EMPLOYEES OR MY CLIENTS. AND MY EMPLOYEES ARE
VERY NERVOUS. I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS THAT TRULY STRUGGLED
THROUGH COVID. I LITERALLY EMPTIED MY PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, BUSINESS
ACCOUNTS, AND WENT INTO HAWK WITH LOANS TO KEEP MY BUSINESS
AFLOAT. I DID APPLY FOR A PPE AND WAS ALLOWED TO PAY MY EMPLOYEES
THAT WAY. THIS IS GOING TO REALLY SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THIS MASS AVE. I
LOOK OUTSIDE NOW AND IT LOOKS LIKE A GHOST TOWN. NO BUSINESSES
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE OPEN. PEOPLE WILL PASS BY US AND I DON'T SEE IT. I
SEE BARELY ANY BICYCLES GO BY HERE. IT IS A JOKE. BEFORE WINTER COME
ON!
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS ERIC GRUNEBAUM.
>> HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME? GREETINGS, MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND EVERYONE.
I'M SPEAKING ON THE ALEWIFE ZONING POLICY ORDER NUMBER 246. I
SERVED ON THE ENVISION ALEWIFE WORKING GROUP, SPENDING MANY
NIGHTS WORKING WITH A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS, CONSULTANTS AND
STAFF TO COME UP WITH A PROPOSED MIXED USED FRAMEWORK. NO
ZONING IS WRITTEN AND BASICALLY BECOME A FREE FOR ALL. WHAT IS THE
HOLD UP? THE PLAN IS NOT PERFECT, WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS PROJECT BY
PROJECT APPROACH. THE WHIM OF WELL FUNDED DEVELOPERS WITH THE
CITIZENS FORCED TO SPEND THEIR FREE TIME PLAYING DEFENSE. RESPECT
THE TIME WE HAVE ALL INVESTED AND BEFORE THIS LAND IS FILLED WITH


PAGE 5

May 24, 2021

MORE MEGABLOCK COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AS THE TRIANGLE.
AS A LIFE LONG RESIDENT, I FIND IT DISAPPOINTING OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE
NORTH IS CAPABLE OF CREATING MIX USED DEVELOPMENTS AS ASSEMBLY
ROAD WHILE CAMBRIDGE IS STUCK COVERING MOST OF THE PARCEL, LITTLE
OPEN SPACE AND NO STREET ACTIVITIES. DEVELOPMENTS ARE MORE LIKE
HOUSTON THAN BOSTON. LABS ARE ALL CONSUMING. THEY ADD TO THE
TACK BASE AND CREATE TRAFFIC AND HOUSING DEMAND. NOT WHAT THE
YEAR OF EFFORT CALLED FOR.
REGARDING TRAFFIC, I ASK THE CITY AND DEVELOPERS TO FUND A NEW RAIL
STOP ON THE FITCHBURG LINE. A BRIDGE WITHOUT A STOP MOSTLY SOLVES
THE DEVELOPER'S PROBLEM, THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROBLEM OF NEVER
ENDING TRAFFIC GROWTH IS ONLY HALF SOLVED. WITHOUT A RAIL STOP, A
BRIDGE IS A WASTED EFFORT. SIX YEARS AGO, CAMBRIDGE CONSULTANT HDR
REPORTED THERE WAS ALREADY ENOUGH DENSITY TO JUSTIFY A STOP. YES,
IT IS POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE TWO NEW RAIL STOPS IN THE WORCESTER LINE.
NO REASON THE CITY AND THE BILLION DOLLAR DEVELOPERS WORKING IN
ALEWIFE COULDN'T HELP SOLVE THE CAR PROBLEM BY OFFERING AN
ALTERNATIVE. HAVE COMMON SENSE IN CREATING A ZONING PLAN AND
FOLLOW IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JEANNE OSTER.
>> HI. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND A LONG TIME BUSINESS OWNER.
AND I WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF CHARTER NUMBER THREE, UPPER
MASS AVENUE BIKE LANE IMPROVEMENTS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET
DATA TO SEE IF WHAT WE'RE PLANNING WORKS. I DID REALLY WANT TO
EXPRESS THAT I CARE FOR BIKE SAFETY, BUT I CARE FOR EVERYBODY'S SAFETY.
I GET VERY UPSET THAT THE BICYCLISTS, NOT ALL OF THEM, IF THEY HEAR
YOU ARE NOT 100% FOR BIKE PLANS, THEY DEMONIZE YOU AND THEY SPIT ON
CARS AND I HEARD THEM PROTEST OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES. WE JUST
WANT THE BIKE LANES TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY.
THE DATA WOULD LET YOU KNOW WHERE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE
MADE AND ADJUSTMENTS MADE NEED TO BE MADE. A LOT OF ACCIDENTS
HAPPEN ON THE TURNS AND ADDING STRAIGHT AWAY FLEX POSTS HURTS
BUSINESSES AND DOESN'T KEEP BICYCLISTS SAFE. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS,
THERE WAS A TOTAL OF TEN INJURIES FROM DUDLEY TO ALEWIFE. FOUR OF
THEM HAD NO INJURY AT ALL. THREE HAD A POSSIBLE INJURY. AND THREE
HAD NON INCAPACITATING INJURY. THAT MAY BE SAFE BECAUSE THERE'S A
PARALLEL BIKE LANE. PLEASE CONSIDER ALL THE DATA AND MAKE
IMPROVEMENTS AND MAKE SURE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ACTUALLY
HELPING AND NOT HURTING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP WE HAVE ANNETTE OSGOOD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI. 115 CLIFTON STREET AND I SUPPORT THE ORDER
FOR STUDY TO KEEP PARKING ALONG MASS AVENUE. IT IS TRYING TO
RESTORE THE PARKING AND ALSO LOOKING FOR A WAY TO COMPROMISE
AND WORK TOGETHER AND LOOK AT ALL STAKEHOLDERS, RESIDENTS,
BUSINESSES, AND COMMUTERS. SAVE MASS AVENUE SUBMITTED A PETITION

PAGE 6

May 24, 2021

WITH 800 SIGNATURES ASKING FOR INPUT IN A COMMUNITY MEETING. WE
ARE STARTING A PETITION UP TO 160 SIGNATURES ASKING FOR CITY WIDE
PROJECT MANAGER TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THAT IS IN CHARGE
OF THE PROTECTED LANES BEING PUT UP, SEGMENT BY SEGMENT
THROUGHOUT THE CITY. AND THEY ALL HAVE TO BE EVALUATED. THERE'S A
LOT OF BIKE LANES ALREADY IN PLACE. THEY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT, WANT
JUST FOR THE AFFECT ON TRAFFIC, BUT FOR THE AFFECT ON ACCIDENTS,
SEVERITY OF ACCIDENTS INVOLVING BIKES, INCREASING RIDERSHIP, HOW
BUSINESSES FARE, REVENUE IS UP AND DOWN AND THE CLOSURE RATES.
ABILITY TO PARK AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE TRAFFIC BEING DIVERTED
TO THEIR STREET. AFFECTS ON COMMUTERS, BIKES, CARS, AND MBTA. EVERY
PERSON I HAVE TALKED TO LOOKS FOR A COMPROMISE. THE CYCLING GROUP
SAYS IF YOU ARE NOT 100% FOR THIS PLAN, YOU HAVE TO 100% AGAINST IT.
IT IS NOT TRUE. WE NEED A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE
TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT CREATING A DIRECT PATH FROM ARLINGTON TO
BOSTON AT THE EXPENSE OF CAMBRIDGE BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS.
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN AMERICA. CLOSING
DOWN SMALL BUSINESS HURTS JOBS AND FAMILIES. BUSINESSES THAT
PROVIDE SERVICES, DOCTORS, RESTAURANTS, THEY NEED REAL PARKING AND
NOT JUST STOPPING AT A LOADING ZONE. THE OTHER ADVANTAGE THAT
BIKE LANES GIVE IS TO AMAZON. THEY WANT TO SEND INDIVIDUAL ITEMS
OUT BY TRUCK TO EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL RESIDENT. AGAIN, THIS
DOESN'T HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT DOESN'T HELP CAMBRIDGE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. ANNETTE, FEEL FREE
TO EMAIL YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE NANCY JORDALEN.
>> NANCY AND STEVEN HAVEN'T JOINED. MATT, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M SORRY. STEVEN, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M STEVEN. I LIVE ON CRAWFORD STREET AND SPEAK IN FAVOR OF
CHARTER RIGHT THREE. I THINK THE BICYCLE PLAN NEEDS MORE INPUT
FROM ALL RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AS WELL AS BICYCLISTS. I FEEL IT
NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED. I THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE I LIVE, WE SEEM TO
HAVE A LOT OF 20 30 YEAR OLDS AND 60 70 YEAR OLDS. THE 60 70 YEAR
OLDS NEED PARKING TO GET TO THEIR HOMES, A FRIEND OF MINE HAS A
VERY ELDERLY MOTHER AND SHE HAS TO GET UP TO BROOKLINE TO TAKE
CARE OF HER AND BACK. IF SHE LOSES HER PARKING PLACE, IT WILL BE A
SEVERE HARDSHIP. I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT HAS NOT BEEN NOTED IS
THAT BICYCLE SAFETY HAS BEEN IMPROVING FOR THE LAST I'D SAY 15
YEARS. LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AND THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS
ARE GOING DOWN. I THINK BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF BICYCLISTS, AS WELL
AS DRIVERS, WOULD CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS GO DOWN AND MAKE THIS
VERY DRACONIAN CHANGE IN BOSTON LESS THAN NECESSARY.
THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I THINK BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO
BE VERY BADLY IMPACTED. I HAVE SEEN SOME STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO
SHOW BICYCLE LANES ACTUALLY HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. I THINK THESE
SHOULD BE VIEWED WITH CAUTION BECAUSE THE STUDIES ARE DONE BY

PAGE 7

May 24, 2021

CYCLE ADVOCATES AND PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS THAT ARE VERY, VERY
SYMPATHETIC TO THE IDEA OF BICYCLE LANES AND REDUCED PARKING. I
HOPE THE CITY COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH RESIDENTS,
BUSINESSES, BICYCLISTS, AND RECONSIDER THOSE ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT
THAT NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I THINK CHICO IS BACK?
>> CHICO, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF. I THINK THEY MAY BE
HAVING TROUBLE UNMUTING.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M CHICO, I'M A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AND
OWN A PROPERTY ALONG MASS AVENUE. AND I WANT TO SAY I'M
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THERE WAS NO COMMUNITY
OUTREACH PRIOR TO THE POLITICAL DECISIONS BEING MADE. AND NOW THIS
PAST WEEKEND, THEY HAD COMMUNITY OUTREACH AFTER THE POLITICAL
DECISIONS WERE MADE AND VOTED ON AND INTO LAW. BASICALLY, THERE
WAS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE POLITICAL SIDE
OF THE DISCUSSION OF WHETHER WE SHOULD WE MOVE PARKING SPACES
OR NOT. I URGE THE COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER THE BIKE LANE AS IT IS
DESIGNED RIGHT NOW AND REMOVING THE PARKING SPACES THAT ARE
VITAL FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES ALONG MASS AVE.
I YIELD MY TIME, BUT I URGE THE COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER WHAT THEY ARE
PLANNING ON DOING TO MASS AVENUE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE MATT LERNER.
>> MATT, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. CAROLYN O'HARA, GO
AHEAD.
>> HI. I'M A 31 YEAR RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE
CITY TO CONSULT WITH PEOPLE WHERE CHANGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN
MADE. CONSULT WITH THE ELDERLY, CONSULT WITH THE DISABLED,
CONSULT WITH BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED
BEFORE CONTINUING TO MAKE CHANGES WITHIN THE CITY.
THE CHANGES AROUND ST. PAUL'S CHURCH HAVE DRASTICALLY DEPLETED
PARKING. ST. PAUL'S IS ACTIVE EVERY DAY WITH THE WEEK WITH 12 DAILY
MASSES, FOUR SUNDAY MASSES, AND A VERY ACTIVE BOY'S SCHOOL.
HARVARD CATHOLIC CENTER AND MANY PROGRAMS. THERE'S A FOOD
PANTRY, ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASSES AND SO ON. SUNDAY
MASS IS AN AVERAGE ATTENDED BY 1,000 PEOPLE. PARISHIONERS AND THE
BOY'S SCHOOL PARENTS ARE FROM SURROUNDING TOWNS, INCLUDING
ANDOVER. IT IS A PARISH WITH A FULL LIFE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.
ELIMINATION OF PARKING AROUND ST. PAUL'S IS DRAMATIC. PARKING NO
LONGER AVAILABLE ON CLIFTON OR LYNDON. PARKING ON MASS AVENUE,
DOWN TO DANA IS GONE. PARKING ON TWO RESIDENTIAL STREETS IS RARELY
AVAILABLE. AND THAT IS REALLY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR PARISHIONERS TO
FIND SPOTS. I'M ACTIVE WITH THE HOMEBOUND MINISTRY AND THE ELDERLY
THAT I VISIT WHO ARE HOMEBOUND ARE VERY MUCH AFFECTED BY THE
PARKING SITUATIONS.

May 24, 2021

FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE WORKERS, AND FOR THEIR HOUSEKEEPERS. AND IN
CONCLUSION, I'D LIKE TO SAY IS CAMBRIDGE AN INCLUSIVE CITY OR BEING
REDESIGNED JUST FOR THE NEEDS OF THE YOUNG AND THE FIT. I'M
CERTAINLY THE CITY MANAGER AND COUNCIL INTENDED FOR THE CITY TO BE
INCLUSIVE EVALUATE WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. CHRIS CHANDOR?
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF DEVELOP FOR THE DAVIS
COMPANIES AND HAVE BEEN A PROPERTY OWNER IN THE QUAD IN THE
MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION OF WILSON AND SMITH. SEVERAL PARCELS SINCE
2012. CURRENTLY WE HAVE ONE BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT 101
SMITH, WHICH IS THE FIRST GROUND UP LIFE SCIENCE BUILDING IN THE
QUAD. UP TO THAT POINT, WE JUSTIFIED DOING SMALLER RENOVATIONS. I'D
LIKE TO SAY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WITH CDD, ON 101, IT WAS VERY
CLEAR THAT WE WERE GOING TO COMPLY WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SET
FORTH IN ENVISION CAMBRIDGE. WHEN WE FIRST CAME IN EARLY 2019,
BEFORE ENVISION WAS RELEASED, CDD SENT US BACK TO THE DRAWING
BOARD WITH A LOT OF ADVICE ON WHAT IS COMING IN ENVISION IN TERMS
OF MOVING THE PARKING UNDERGROUND, ELEVATING THE GROUND FLOOR
FOR RESILIENCE AND DURING THE PROCESS IN LATE 2019 AND EARLY 2020,
WE WORKED ON STREET CYCLE TRACK, ELEVATED OUTDOOR SIDEWALKS,
OPEN SPACE, IN THE END WE HAVE A BETTER PROJECT THAN ORIGINALLY
PROPOSED. DURING THAT TIME, REALIZING THE GOALS THAT WERE SET
FORTH IN ENVISION, WE VOLUNTARY TORE UP SPACES AND ADDED A CAFE,
WHICH IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, TO BRING MORE FOOD SERVICE CONSISTENT
WITH ENVISION. TODAY WE ARE PLEASED TO WORK WITH CDD ON THE
SECOND GROUND UP OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT HAS AN
AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A MULTIUSE
BIKE PATH ALONG THE SOUTH EASTERN SIDE.
WE IMPLORE THE CITY COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER AND NOT SLOW DOWN OUR
BUILDING TO DELIVER ON A NUMBER OF THE GOALS OF ENVISION QUITE
COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE CITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MIKE NAKAGAWA.
>> HELLO. MADISON AVENUE, NORTH CAMBRIDGE. HELLO. THANK YOU FOR
ALLOWING ME TIME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF LAST WEEK'S POLICY ORDER 4,
REGARDING THE CHANCE TO BALANCE DEVELOP IN THE ALEWIFE AREA. I
TALKED ABOUT THE VARIOUS CITY PLANS THAT HAVE TAKEN EFFORT FROM
THE RESIDENTS AND STAFF ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THE
ATTENTION TO NEW DEVELOPMENT AND THE UNWILLINGNESS TO GET
ENOUGH STAFFING TO ADDRESS THE PACE OF THE DEVELOPMENT.
NOW, CAN I BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CONCERNS OF THAT AREA, WHICH
SOME WAYS APPLY TO THE WHOLE CITY. THE ENVISION ALEWIFE WORKING
GROUP LAUGHED WHEN I SAID WE NEED FOR THE AREA TO REMAIN LIGHT
INDUSTRIAL. PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD. ALL THE NEW TECH AND LAB
DEVELOPMENT IS CHASING OUT LOW BARRIER ENTRY JOB WITH CAREER
POTENTIALS AND FOUR TIMES OF THE PAY STANDARD RETAIL RESTAURANT


PAGE 9

May 24, 2021

JOBS AS EXPLAINED IN THE DISTRICT PLAN. WHAT HAPPENS, BECAUSE
THERE'S NO GOOD WAY TO REACH ALEWIFE FROM THE SUBURBS, IT IS THE
END OF THE RED LINE AND NO COMMUTER RAIL STOP. PEOPLE WILL NEED TO
LIVE IN THE INN ER CORE TO GET TO THE JOBS. EMPLOYEES WILL BUY UP THE
MODERATELY PRICED HOUSING AND CREATING A CRUNCH IN THE CITY A LOT
DON'T LIKE LIVING IN THE COMPRESSED SPACES. WE'LL GET MORE PEOPLE IN
THE AREA AND DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.
OR IMPORTING MORE PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE AREA TO LIVE HERE
WHEN WE HAVE HARD ENOUGH TIME HOUSING THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY
HERE. ON THE FRESH POND PARKWAY... 14 HOURS OF WE NEED TO GET
PEOPLE TO REACH OUR JOBS SO THEY DON'T DESTABILIZE THE HOUSING
SITUATION. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN DO AND THERE ARE COSTS. WE
HAVE PLANS OF WHAT WE SAY WE SHOULD DO, BUT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE
MEETING REQUIREMENTS AND TRY TO REACH THE BALANCE OF
DEVELOPMENT. AND IF THE CITY ACTS QUICKLY, IT WON'T BE FOR TWO
YEARS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SUZANNE BLIER.
>> THANK YOU. FULLER PLACE AND I'M ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT POLICY
ORDER 246 FOR THE ALEWIFE AREA IN CAMBRIDGE HIGHLANDS TO PAUSE
DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE SOLID PLAN IS IN PLACE. I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER
247, WITH THE NEED TO RETHINK THE BIKE LANES AND BUS TRANSIT SO
EVERYONE IS ON THE TABLE. SMALL BUSINESSES, SENIORS, AND OTHERS. I
WANT TO TAKE UP CHARTER RIGHT NUMBER ONE, UNIVERSAL DESIGN
PLAYGROUND. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY, IMPORTANT ONE, TO ADDRESS
EQUITY. 98% OF STREETS, PARKS, NAMED AFTER ONE GENDER, MALE. AND
ONE RACE WHITE. WHY NOT THE ROBERT MOSES OR JULIA CHILD OR
OTHERS. WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY WITH THE 19TH EQUITY MONUMENT CALL
THE PROJECT BACK. CAMBRIDGE WOMEN HERITAGE PROJECT ARE KEY
EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO DO. INVITE RESIDENTS TO GET INVOLVED AND
PRIORITIZE WOMEN AND MINORITIES SO BY THE YEAR 2050 OR 2075 WE CAN
SAY WE HAVE REACHED PARITY. AND THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART
REFUSE TO COLLECT LIVING ARTISTS. LET'S MAKE A PLAN NOT TO NAME
PARKS AND STREETS AND SQUARES AFTER CURRENT CITY POLITICIANS OR
EMPLOYEES. I WANT TO BRIEFLY TAKE UP THE AHO PROJECT ADDRESSED THIS
WEEK AND TO SAY WE NEED MORE OVERSIGHT. WHEN JEFFERSON PARK
UNITS COST $918,000 WITHOUT LAND ACQUISITION AND THE MARKET RATE
DEVELOPERS IS $250,000. THERE'S A PROBLEM. WHEN THE PLANNING
BOARD CHAIR SAYS THE PROPOSED JEFFERSON PARK AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE
SUBPAR, WE KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS. AND
WE NEED FAR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DAVID AJEMIAND.
>> THANK YOU. I LIVE ON CAMBRIDGE STREET. I OFFER A COMMENT LAST
WEEK. SPEAKING ON THE CHARTER RIGHT THREE. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR
40 YEARS. I HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THIS ENCROACHMENT OF THE BIKE
LANES. I DRIVE MY CAR A LOT SO I'M AWARE OF HOW DRIVING HAS BECOME
MORE DIFFICULT WITH THE NARROWING OF LANES. I THINK THE FLEX POSTS

PAGE 10

May 24, 2021

ARE REAL EYE SORE AESTHETICALLY. I REALIZE THAT GETS INTO LARGER
ISSUES OF LIKE A REAL BATTLEGROUND, A CITY FOR CARS OR BIKES. IT
SEEMS TO ME CAMBRIDGE IS UNILATERALLY DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE
BIKES. I DON'T SEE A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND INPUT. SOMEONE SAID THERE
WAS NOT A REFERENDUM ON THIS MASSIVE CHANGE IN THE CITY. I SUPPORT
THE IDEA OF CITY MANAGER AND MORE CONSULTATION AND EVALUATION.
IT DISTURBS ME A LOT TO HEAR THESE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE BEING
IMPACTED AND THAT JUST SEEMS VERY UNFORTUNATE.
SO AGAIN, AN ISSUE AS MY FRIEND CAROLYN SAID, ARE WE GOING TO BE
SIMPLY A CITY FOR THE YOUNG AND THE FIT? OR JUDGE THE NEEDS OF
EVERYONE INVOLVED? THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, ROY RUSSELL? SIR, THERE'S MASK REQUIRED
IN THE BUILDING. PLEASE GRAB A MASK.
>> I'M CLAIMING MY MENTAL HEALTH EXEMPTION, WHICH I BELIEVE IS
WRITTEN INTO THE ORDINANCE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, ROY RUSSELL?
>> ROY RUSSELL, HAS NOT JOINED. JOAN, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE
THE FLOOR. JOAN PICKETT SEEMS UNABLE TO UNMUTE THEMSELVES.
YOUNG KIM HAS JOINED. CAN WE GO TO THEM NEXT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> YOUNG KIM, IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. LEE
FERRIS, GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> GREAT. ANOTHER SURPRISE JUST LIKE LAST WEEK. SO, I'M SPEAKING IN
FAVOR OF WHAT HAD BEEN POLICY ORDER 4 AND NOW A CHARTER RIGHT 2.
THE MORATORIUM ON DEVELOPMENT OF LAB AND OFFICE SPACE IN ALEWIFE
QUAD UNTIL THE END OF 2023. I AGREE WITH THE POINTS PEOPLE HAVE
MADE ALREADY TODAY. THEY HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT. AND I WANT TO BE
CLEAR THAT I'M LOOKING FOR A CITY WIDE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS,
NOT JUST A NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING PROCESS BECAUSE THE ALEWIFE
QUAD IS HUGE AND WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE CITY. AND I WANT US TO STOP
THE DEVELOPER LED PLANNING PROCESS. THE DEVELOPER WHO SAID HE
WORKED WITH CDD TO IMPLEMENT THE ENVISION GOALS, THAT'S NOT
ADEQUATE FOR PRESERVING THE INTERESTS OF RESIDENTS AS DISCUSSED IN
ENVISION. ENVISION HAS GOALS THAT CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER.
ZONING ENACTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL WOULD CLARIFY OUR PRIORITIES
AND SAY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DIFFERENT GOAL S GO AGAINST EACH
OTHER. I'D LIKE TO SEE A RAIL STOP AND A BRIDGE THERE AS WELL AS
HOUSING IN THE QUAD. REALLY WHAT WE NEED IS TO STOP THE PROJECT BY
PROJECT DEVELOPER LED PLANNING PROCESS. ON THE SEPARATE MATTER,
CMA 249, THE CITY HAS ORDERED A CONTRACT FOR A BROADBAND STUDY TO
DO CTC. I WOULD ASK THAT COUNCILLORS URGE THE CITY TO PUBLISH THE

FULL CONTRACT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN SEE WHAT THE CITY IS
ASKING TO BE DONE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> JACKSON PLACE, JEFFERSON PARK IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE. AND I
COULDN'T FIND THE TEXT OF COMMUNICATION NUMBER THREE FROM
MANNING TENANT COUNCIL. THERE'S STUFF MISSING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THERE IS SO MUCH MISSING OR POSTED LATE FROM THE COUNCIL
MEETING AGENDA. WHAT HAPPENED TO COMMUNICATION NUMBER THREE
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS BEFORE THE END OF TONIGHT'S MEETING,
IF POSSIBLE.
I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT RINDGE AVE AND NORTH MASS AVENUE. I HAPPEN
TO ATTEND ONLINE A PORTION OF A TWO DAY CONFERENCE THAT STARTED
TODAY AT MIT CALLED "WATER SUMMIT." THERE WAS A NEW PHRASE TO
ME, SOCIAL LICENSE. IT WAS AMAZING DISCUSSION ABOUT AQUACULTURE IN
MAINE AND HOW ONE INDIVIDUAL TALKS ABOUT WE GO AND WE MEET WITH
ALL THE FISHERMEN AND ALL THE PEOPLE, AND WHEN WE GO TO THE
HEARING, NOBODY SHOWED UP. THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE WERE
DOING AND THEY WERE IN AGREEMENT AND ALL ON BOARD. THEY HAVE
BEEN A PART. AND THEN THIS BIG CORPORATE AQUACULTURE PEOPLE COME
IN ACADIA, THEY WILL THROW DOWN A LOT OF MONEY AND PRODUCE A LOT
OF JOBS, THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY ARE UP IN ARMS AGAINST IT BECAUSE OF
THE WAY THEY WENT ABOUT IT. I THINK THIS IS SO SOCIAL LICENSE. THIS IS
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN FOR NORTH MASS AVENUE. AND SHOULD BE
HAPPENING AT RINDGE AVE. A PLAN FOR TWO WAY BIKE LANE THAT
REMOVES A SIDEWALK GOT INTRODUCED AT THE LAST MINUTE WITHOUT
CONSULTATION WITH THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S REAL SERIOUS QUESTIONS.
WHEN PEOPLE USE THE PHRASE, MULTI USE PATH, WHAT IT MEANS IS JUST A
BIKE PATH. PEDESTRIANS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE IT SAFELY. AND SO, LET'S BE
REALLY CAREFUL HOW WE GO ABOUT THINGS IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT.
>> 17 LAUREL STREET AND I WILL SPEAK ON THE CITY MANAGER AGENDA
ITEM ON BROADBAND AS MENTIONED BY ANOTHER SPEAKER. I HOPE THAT
THE COUNCIL CAN PUSH TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS CONTRACT.
THE RFP THAT LED TO THE CONTRACT WAS, AT BEST, FLAWED IF NOT
INCOHERENT. AND I REALLY THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
IS ACTUALLY BEING CONTRACTED TO AND AGREED TO. I WILL NOTE THAT
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS HERE WHERE THE CITY IS WALKING DOWN
MANY OF THE SAME PATHS THEY HAVE BEFORE WITH REGARD TO DIGITAL
EQUITY. THE DIGITAL EQUITY PREVIOUS WORK WAS REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT
WE SHOULD WORK ON. AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. WE ARE ONCE AGAIN
GOING INTO BUILDINGS, PLANNING THINGS FROM A TECHNOLOGY
STANDPOINT, BUT WITHOUT A PEOPLE STANDPOINT. AND LOW INCOME
HOUSING, DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ANY SITUATION, GOING

PAGE 12

May 24, 2021

INTO SOMEONE'S HOME AND TELLING THEM THIS WHAT YOU WILL GET NOW,
I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT. AND
REALLY IMPORTANT.
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO NOTE HERE, ACCORDING TO THE CITY
MANAGER'S LETTER, THIS HAS BEEN FUNDED WITHOUT THE COUNCIL'S
DIRECT APPROVAL OUT OF THE ARPA FUNDS. YOU MAY REMEMBER SEVERAL
MONTHS AGO, I SPOKE TO THE COUNCIL AND SAID YOU SHOULDN'T APPROVE
THIS BECAUSE IT WILL ACT AS A GIANT SLUSH FUND FOR THE CITY MANAGER
TO SPEND WHAT HE WANTS WITHOUT DIRECT APPROVAL. I DIDN'T WANT TO
BE RIGHT BECAUSE THE MANAGER MADE PROMISES ON HOW THE MONEY
WILL BE CONSIDERED AND HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT. AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAVE TAKEN SOMETHING WHERE THE COUNCIL
MIGHT HAD AN OVERSIGHT CAPACITY, THE CITY MANAGER KNEW HE MIGHT
HAVE TO FACE A TOUGH QUESTION OR TWO, AND IT IS FUNDED OUT OF THIS
FUND WITHOUT HAVING ANY MEETINGS ON IT, WITHOUT DECISION MAKING,
AND IT IS REALLY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE THAT BE THE CASE. I HOPE YOU
WILL CONSIDER THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH
MEETINGS TO EVALUATE HOW WE'LL SPEND THE FUNDS SO THEY ARE NOT
ALL WASTED LIKE THIS. THANKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SUSAN LABANDIBAR.
>> HELLO. I LIVE AT 9 A FOREST STREET AND I'M NOT TALKING ON BEHALF OF
MYSELF AND I WASN'T PLANNING ON JOINING THIS MEETING UNTIL I TOOK A
SKIRT TO BE RELINED TO ELEGANT TAILOR ON MASS AVENUE. I WALKED, MET
THE OWNER, WHO HAS BEEN IN THE DRY CLEANING BUSINESS FOR 30 YEARS.
AND GAVE HER MY SKIRT AND AFTER, SHE SAID, DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE? I
SAID, YES. SHE TOOK ME OVER TO A FLYER. SHE SAID, I'M LOSING MY
PARKING. I CAN'T LOSE MY PARKING. I HAVE ELDERLY CUSTOMERS. I DON'T
COVID HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ME. I BROKE MY LEG. CAME BACK AND THIS
PARKING THING WAS HAPPENING. AND SHE IS IN LITERALLY IN TEARS. I FELT
IT WAS I SAID, DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER. SHE SAID NO. I WANTED TO
RELAY HER LIVED EXPERIENCE AND AS SOMEONE IS 25 YEAR BUSINESS
OWNER I CAN UNDERSTAND HER CONCERN. AND IT IS VERY HARD FOR HER
TO LEAVE THE STORE. SHE WORKS VERY, VERY LONG HOURS. AND THIS CITY
HAS NOT REACHED OUT TO HER. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THAT
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO POLICY ORDER 247. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING BACK TO YOUNG KIM AND
THEN JOAN PICKETT. FOLLOWED BY HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> YES, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS SECOND CHANCE. I'M VISITING MY
DAUGHTER AND I'M HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY. THIS IS YOUNG KIM,
SPEAKING ON CHARTER RIGHT ITEM THREE. MASS AVENUE BIKE LANE
IMPROVEMENTS. THE BICYCLE SAFETY MEASURES HAVE ALREADY BEEN
IMPLEMENTED. I'M REQUESTING THE POLICY ORDER BEING AMENDED TO
ORDER THE CITY MANAGER TO REPORT BACK MONITORING AND MITIGATION
PLANS FOR TRAFFIC CONGESTION CAUSED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION BIKE
SAFETY MEASURES. FURTHERMORE, PLEASE amend THE ORDER AND ORDER
THE CITY MANAGER TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON THE UPPER MASS AVENUE BIKE

PAGE 13

May 24, 2021

SAFETY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECT TO BE USED TO GUIDE ALL THE
REMAINING CYCLE SAFETY ORDINANCE PROJECT. REPORT IS TO BE
COMPLETED IN TIME TO BE USED AS A TEMPLATE FOR A REPORT AS
DESCRIBING MY COMMENTS FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE NEW
PROJECT BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS.
LAST SATURDAY, I WAS TOLD A BUS DRIVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE OVER
TO THE GENERAL VEHICLE LANE IF THE BUS LANE IS BLOCKED BY PARKED CARS
BECAUSE EVEN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC WILL NOT BE AS HEAVY AS MORNING
INBOUND TRAFFIC. TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT PRE
PANDEMIC EVENING INBOUND TRAFFIC CONGESTION THAT EXISTED,
RESIDENTS ALWAYS LIVED WITH AND NOT ONLY THAT, THE MASS DRIVER
MANUAL SAYS YOU CAN'T CROSS THE WHITE LINE UNLESS YOU ARE IN
DANGER. AND IF THE BUS CAN CROSS THE WHITE LINES, SO SHOULD THE
REGULAR DRIVERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. WE'RE GOING TO
JOAN PICKETT, FOLLOWED BY HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO GET
ON. I SPEAK ABOUT CALENDAR ITEM THREE, COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S POLICY
ORDER. 247. AND I'M GOING TO REITERATE SOME POINTS I MADE IN A
LETTER I SENT TO COUNCIL DATED 11/10. IT WAS AFTER LAST WEEK'S CITY
COUNCIL MEETING. I WANT TO RAISE THOSE POINTS.
I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S POLICY ORDER WAS OFFERED WITH THE BEST
OF INTENTIONS. HOWEVER, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIKE AND BUS
LANES ARE WELL UNDERWAY. SO MANY OR MOST OF THE REPORTS AND
INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE POLICY ORDER WILL CLEARLY BE AVAILABLE
AFTER THE FACT, UNLESS THE IMPLEMENTATION IS HALTED.
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ASSURANCES CAN THE CITY COUNCIL GIVE
NOW TO THE BUSINESS BUSINESS AND RESIDENTS THAT ANY OF THE
FINDINGS OR ANY OF THE MANY SUGGESTIONS THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AFTER THE FACT. THE RUSH TO IMPLEMENT MASS
AVE IS DRIVEN BY THE CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE, WHICH WAS A FAR
REACHING CITY WIDE LAW WHICH NOT ADEQUATELY ENGAGE THE
COMMUNITY PRIOR TO IT BEING ADOPTED. NOR HAS IT BEEN BROADLY
COMMUNICATED TO THE COMMUNITY NOW.
MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT FROM LAMINATED NOTICES THAT ARE
APPEARING ON STREET SIGNS. THAT IS NOT ADEQUATE OUTREACH. AND
INCLUSIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT RESIDENT PARKING, ELDERLY AND HANDICAP
ISSUES, SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS, SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE THE CSO
WAS PASSED AND PART OF A PLANNING PROCESS. THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES
SHOULDN'T BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND BEING DEALT WITH DURING
IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE'LL GO TO HEATHER HOFFMAN,
FOLLOWED BY ANN.
>> HELLO. 213 HURLEY STREET OR I WILL SAY A WORD ABOUT DIGITAL

EQUITY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME. THE CITY CAN HELP. PLEASE DO.
WITH RESPECT TO THE UPDATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT WAS
EXTREMELY INTERESTING. I TEND TO NOTICE WEIRD THINGS. I WAS VERY
SURPRISED TO SEE THAT JEFFERSON PARK IS A PRESERVATION PROJECT. I DO
HOPE THAT IT TURNS OUT TO BE MORE TRUE THAN IT APPEARS CURRENTLY.
AND WE DON'T HAVE OTHER ANOMALIES IN THE INFORMATION THAT I
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION MYSELF TO NOTICE.
WITH RESPECT TO ALEWIFE... CAN WE SOMETIME PLEASE LEARN THE
LESSONS OF KENDALL SQUARE. SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT
DEVELOPER DRIVEN ZONING. IT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. MIKE IS COMPLETELY
CORRECT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH HOUSING AND EVERYTHING ELSE
WHEN ALL WE DO IS PAD OUR BOTTOM LINE AND NOT CARE ABOUT THE
EFFECTS ON THE COMMUNITY. AND WITH RESPECT TO MY OPEN MEETING
LAW COMPLAINT THAT YOU HAVE, I WILL NOTE ONE ISSUE WITH THE
SOLICITOR'S PROPOSAL, WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE A POLICY ORDER TO
CHANGE THE NOVEMBER 29TH MEETING REPLY DATE TO A ROUND TABLE
WITH THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE SO YOU CAN'T TAKE UP HER REPLY. I WILL
AGREE WITH JAMES, THE AGENDA IS A MESS. PLEASE INCLUDE EVERYTHING.
WE NEED IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. WE'LL GO TO ANNE
BANE.
>> HI. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COUNCIL AND
THE MAYOR. I HAVE A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AND LIVE ON MASS AVENUE.
I SPEAK TO ARTICLE 247. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR A SAFE BIKE LANE. I
HAVE BEEN HIT BY BICYCLISTS PERSONALLY AND IN MY CAR. I UNDERSTAND
THE NEED TO KEEP THEM SAFE, I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
INCLUSIVITY AND THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE RUN A SMALL BUSINESS
ON MASS AVE. LOSING PARKING ON THAT WILL SEVERELY IMPACT OUR
LIVELIHOOD AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY TAXES TO THE CITY LIKE WE DO TODAY.
I THINK WE ARE THE LIFE BLOOD OF KEEPING THE CITY RUNNING AND
WITHOUT OUR ABILITY TO RUN A BUSINESS AND TAKE CARE OF THE
PATIENTS, IT WILL BE REALLY CHALLENGES. I WOULD ASK THE CITY TO
CONSIDER WHAT DO WE DO FOR THE AGEING AND HANDICAP POPULATION
WITH THE PROPOSAL. THE ORDINANCE, BIKE SAFETY ORDINANCE LAW
PASSED, BUT NOW THE PLAN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT. I
KNOW I HAVE ATTENDED BOTH THREE OF THE POP UP MEETINGS THIS
WEEKEND, THAT WAS GOOD TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK. LOOK FOR PEOPLE TO
THINK OF WAYS TO BE CREATIVE AND ADDRESS EVERYBODY'S NEEDS. SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS, AGING AND HANDICAP POPULATIONS AND THE BIKE
POPULATION. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY THAN REMOVING ALL
PARKING LIKE IS DONE ON NORTH END OF MASS AVENUE. I SUPPORT FOLKS
THAT SPOKE BEFORE ME, AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE TRAFFIC WILL BACK
UP WITH THAT ONE TRAVEL LANE ON THE NORTH END OF Mass Ave.
LOOKING FOR A COMPROMISE AND HOPE YOU WILL LISTEN AND PROVIDE
SOME FEEDBACK FOR US TO REALLY WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PATRICK BARRETT?


PAGE 15

May 24, 2021

>> THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I'M PATRICK BARRETT. THE FIRST ITEM IS
THE CHARTER RIGHT ISSUE THAT ACCESSIBLE PARK. I THINK IT IS PROBABLY A
GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE ABOUT EQUITY, BUT I ALSO THINK YOU SHOULD
BE DEFERENTIAL TO THE PERSON THAT FOR WHOM THE DEDICATION IS
BEING MADE. THE COUNCILLOR WHO CHARTER RIGHT THIS HAD TWO YEARS
TO BRING UP THE ISSUE AND HE DIDN'T. I ASK YOU GUYS TO REALLY THINK
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AND TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS
DEDICATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE MANAGER DESERVES TO BE THE SUBJECT
OF THAT TURMOIL.
THE ISSUE OF ALEWIFE, WE WERE PROMISED IN CENTRAL SQUARE, THE RED
RIBBON COMMISSION, C2, EVERY ENVISION, THE PLANS SPENT FIVE YEARS
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. I FEEL FOR MY FRIENDS IN ALEWIFE OTHER
CENTRAL SQUARE IS WAITING FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. IF THE CITY IS
GOING TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PLAN, UTILIZE PUBLIC INPUT,
UTILIZE THE PUBLIC PROCESS IN A WAY IT DOES, IT REALLY OUGHT TO
FOLLOW THROUGH. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS AND ENCOURAGE
YOU TO REACHING OUT TO A DEVELOPER WHO OWNS 36 ACRES OF LAND. IT
SOUNDS LIKE A PUD AND NOT A ZONING ISSUE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE
ORDINANCE, THE ZONING IS A BOOK THAT TELL THE YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT
CAMBRIDGE, WHAT WE VALUE. AND AS A DEVELOPER IS LOOKING IN THE
BOOK AND SEEING SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T LIKE, NOT BECAUSE THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DEVELOPER, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE
BOOK. PLEASE RECONSIDER THIS.
CONSIDER ENGAGING. AND THE OUTREACH FOR THE BIKE LANES, I THINK
PEOPLE MAY NOT RECALL, THE PORTION THIS WAS PASSED AND THE DAY
BEFORE LOCKDOWN. YOU REALLY NEED TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS. WE DID IN CENTRAL SQUARE AND IT WAS REALLY
EASY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO JOEL, FOLLOWED BY ALEX.
>> THANK YOU. I LIVE ON CLIFTON STREET, NEXT TO RUSSELL FIELD. I'M
CLOSE TO THE ALEWIFE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND TO UPPER Mass Ave I'M
SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF CHARTER RIGHT OF POLICY ORDERS THAT ARE
REPRESENTED IN CHARTER RIGHTS 2 AND 3. I THINK THAT THE POLICY ORDER
ABOUT THE ALEWIFE DISTRICT IS VERY WELL WRITTEN. I SUPPORT ALL THE
REASONS FOR AND THE GOALS OF THE POLICY ORDER SO THAT HOPEFULLY
THE ALL THE WORK GOING INTO THE ALEWIFE REVITALIZATION PLAN AND
THE ENVISION ALEWIFE PLAN CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ZONING. I DO
HAVE ONE CONCERN ABOUT THE POLICY ORDER.
WHETHER THE WORDING OF THE TIMELINE IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE ZONING IS CHANGED TO REFLECT ALL THIS WORK ABOUT THE
ALEWIFE DISTRICT. IT SAYS THAT IT WILL BE COMPLETED. THIS PAUSE AND
CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT WILL STOP EITHER WHEN THE ZONING HAS
CHANGED OR FROM DECEMBER 31, 2022. I THINK THE QUESTION IS, THERE
HAVE BEEN SO MANY DELAYS INET GOING THE ZONING AMENDED BASED ON
ALL THIS WORK, WHAT'S TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT DELAYED AGAIN. I ASK
THE COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER THAT AND ASK THE COUNCIL TO STRONGLY

PAGE 16

May 24, 2021

LOOK AT MAKING CHANGES IN THE PARKING ON MASS AVENUE SO ANOTHER
PEOPLE WITH HANDICAP PERMITS BUT MANY TYPES OF PEOPLE WITH
MOBILITY ISSUE BECAUSE OF AGE OR ILLNESS OR INJURY OR SMALL CHILDREN
HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT BEING ABLE TO USE THE SMALL BUSINESS AND WE
SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESS AND LOOK AT CHANGING THE QUICK BUILD
SO IT INCORPORATES THE PARKING ISSUES
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. FEEL FREE TO EMAIL US. ALEX
MERIWETHER.
>> HELLO. THE GENERAL MANAGER OF HARVARD BOOK STORE AT 1256 Mass
Ave. LOCALLY OWNED AND INDEPENDENTLY RUN SINCE 1932. AND I LIVE ON
INMEN STREET. I COME ON POLICY ORDER 247 AND JOINING CHORUS OF
LOCAL BUSINESSES SPEAKING AGAINST THE ELIMINATION OF PARKING ON
MASS AVENUE. I GIVE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THIS WILL AFFECT A
CAMBRIDGE BUSINESS THAT WILL CELEBRATE 90 YEARS NEXT YEAR DESPITE
COUNTLESS OBSTACLES OF WHICH THIS ELIMINATION OF PARKING IS THE
NEXT THREAT.
WE VISITORS OF ALL AGES, OLDER READERS THAT CAN'T BIKE INTO HARVARD
SQUARE OR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, WE HAVE THOSE WHO COME FROM
THE WIDER GREATER BOSTON AREA TO VISIT A LANDMARK FOR WHOM AUTO
TRANSPORT IS THE PRACTICAL WAY TO UNIVERSITY.
IN NON PANDEMIC TIMES, WE BRING VISITORS TO TAPED OUR AUTHOR TALKS
AND SIGNINGS. THEY REQUIRE PARKING, ACCESSIBILITY, AND THEY BRING
PEOPLE TO THE STORE AND SURROUNDING BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS
IN HARVARD SQUARE. THIS IS ALL A PART OF CREATING A THRIVING
COMMUNITY. NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW THIS PROPOSAL AFFECTS DELIVERIES
AND DELIVERY TRUCKS ON MASS AVENUE AND I HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE
OF THEIR ROLE IN THE DISCUSSION.
BOOKS COME ON FREIGHT TRUCKS AND BLOCKBUSTERS BEST SELLERS
DELIVERED ON PALLETS, WHICH CAN'T BE DELIVERED ON SIDE STREETS. WE
HAVE BOOKS DELIVERED EVERY DAY AND PARTICULARLY IN THE PANDEMIC
AND POST PANDEMIC AGE, WE SHIP OUT BOOKS TO CUSTOMERS WHO
CHOOSE US, A SMALL BUSINESS INSTEAD OF AMAZON. WE DEPEND ON
DELIVERIES. WE DEPEND ON PEOPLE COMING TO HARVARD SQUARE. THIS
PROPOSAL IS YET ANOTHER BLOW TO THE LIVELIHOOD OF A SMALL BUSINESS.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JONATHAN BEHRENS.
>> HI. HAMPSHIRE STREET. I WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY IN FAVOR OF THE
CURRENT TRAJECTORY AND ROLLING OUT BIKE LANES. SOME FOLKS ASK FOR
A COMPROMISE. AS THOUGH COMPROMISING THE DESIRE OF CYCLISTS NOT
TO BE KILLED AND THE MOTORIST TO PARK CLOSER IS REASONABLE. WE ARE
IN A CLIMATE CRISIS THAT NECESSITATE PEOPLE SWITCHING FROM CARS TO
ALTERNATIVES TRANSIT. DRIVERS ARE FREQUENTLY CRASHING CARS INTO
CYCLISTS. THE CITY'S PASSAGE OF THE ORDINANCE DISPLAY THE
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF URGENCY. LET'S FOLLOW THE AGREED SCHEDULE.

THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JANIE KATZ CHRISTY. GO AHEAD.
>> HI, THERE. I CALLED IN BEFORE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE FAINT. CAN YOU SPEAK LOUDER?
>> IS THIS BETTER?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO, THAT IS NOT BETTER.
>> MY PHONE IS TERRIBLE. SORRY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO. IF YOU CONTINUE AT THAT RATE, WE CAN HEAR
YOU. GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. LIKE MANY CYCLISTS, I LOVE SMALL BUSINESS. I NEVER
ORDER ON AMAZON AND I CHALLENGE SO MANY OF THE CALLERS TO SAY THE
SAME. REALLY. I'M HEARTBROKEN TO HEAR SO MUCH MISINFORMATION
AND FEAR MONGERING ABOUT THE BIKE AND TRANSIT PRIORITY LANES ON
MASS AVENUE. MISREPRESENTED IS THE ISSUE OF PARKING. ALL PARKING
HAS NOT AND WILL NOT BE REMOVED FROM NORTH MASS AVENUE OR
OTHER PARTS AND BUSINESSES CAN APPLY FOR HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE
PARKING SPOT. AND I GUESS AS A PARENT OF THREE KIDS, AND NOW AS A
SENIOR, I DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO BE CHARACTERIZING SENIORS AS
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I MEET SO MANY SENIORS WHO WANT TO BE
ABLE TO GET AROUND IN SAFE WAYS.
INCLUDING BIKING. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BIKING. THEY ARE NOT
ALL THE YOUNG SPANDEX PEOPLE AND I GO TO A BUS AND GO TO DOCTORS
IN ARLINGTON IN A TIMELY WAY. I HAVE LISTENED TO THE CLIMATE TALKS
AND WE LIVE IN A PROGRESSIVE CITY, AND WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF
HAVING SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE, THERE'S AN
UPRISING BY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CLIMATE AWARE PEOPLE.
I'M FRUSTRATED AT THE REACTION AND CONSERVATISM IN OUR
COMMUNITY. I WANT TO SEE PETTY CABs USING OUR STREETS AND
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. FEEL FREE TO EMAIL
THE REMAINDER. ANYONE ELSE WHO IS LEFT?
>> THAT CONCLUDES EVERYONE WHO SIGNED UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THAT CONCLUDES PUBLIC COMMENT. ON A
MOTION BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT, WE'LL DO A
ROLL CALL?

Motion by Councillor Carlone
to close public comment

>> ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE NOW ON THE CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA. NO
RECONSIDERATIONS. WE'LL PULL NUMBER ONE, THE COVID 19 UPDATE AND

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: 9 AND 12.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 12 IS PULLED BY VICE MAYOR MALLON. WE PULLED 1,
2, 4, 7, 9, 10, AND 12. ANYONE ELSE?

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL ON ITEMS 3, 5, 6, 8, 11.
>> ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM ONE.
RELATIVE TO AN UPDATE ON COVID 19. CITY MANAGER?
>> CITY MANAGER: GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY. TONIGHT SUE BREEN AND I
WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A COVID 19 UPDATE. CAMBRIDGE'S SEVEN DAY
MOVING AVERAGE FOR CONFIRMED CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND IS 14.7
TODAY. ADDITIONALLY, THE POSITIVITY RATE IS POINT 24 PERCENT OF 1
PERCENT. AS REPORTED ON NOVEMBER 11. AS OF TODAY, THE SEVEN DAY
AVERAGE OF THE PERCENT OF POSITIVITY FOR THE COMMONWEALTH IS 2.32
PERCENT. AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT CAMBRIDGE NOW HAS
80% OF ITS RESIDENTS WITH AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF THE VACCINE. I BELIEVE
THIS IS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY OF THE TOP TEN LARGEST CITIES IN
THE STATE AND SOMETHING WE ARE PROUD OF AND WORKED HARD ON. I
WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN GETTING US TO THE 80%. AND
THE COUNCIL. 70% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE FULLY VACCINATED ACCORDING
TO THE COVID 19 MUNICIPALITY VACCINE REPORT PUBLISHED ON NOVEMBER
11. GREAT TO SEE THE PERCENTAGES STARTING TO MOVE IN AN UPWARD
MANNER. AS ALWAYS, THE CITY'S METRICS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE DATA
CENTER.
I WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT FOR THE GREAT COVID 19 AND FLU VACCINATION CLINIC LAST
WEEK AT THE KING SCHOOL. AT THIS EVENT THIS IS THE FIRST CLINIC
WHERE OUR YOUTH AGES 5 11 RECEIVED A VACCINE AND HAD A GREAT
SHOWING OF YOUTH TO RECEIVE THE FIRST DOSE. A SECOND CLINIC FOR
THOSE WHO NEED A SECOND COVID 19 DOSE WILL BE HELD DECEMBER 1,
3:30 TO 7:30 AT THE KING OPEN. THE CITY OFFERS COVID 19 TESTING FOUR
DAYS A WEEK. IT IS AT CAMBRIDGESIDE TWO DAYS A WEEK, 50 CHURCH
STREET AND HARVARD SQUARE AND ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. AGAIN, WE
CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION WITH CIC ABOUT ADDING A FIFTH DAY. I HAVE
MENTIONED, WE ARE HOPING A FIFTH DAY WOULD BRING TESTING AT THE
CHRISTIAN LIFE CENTER. IT WILL HELP ORGANIZATIONS, HOWEVER CIC IS
EXPERIENCING STAFFING CHALLENGES AS WELL. AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE
TO TALK, WE MAY NEED TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE SITE WE'RE UNDER THE
DISCUSSIONS NOW WITH THEM. WE'LL GET INTO MORE DETAIL IN A
MOMENT.
WE HAVE AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY 637 TESTS PER DAY IN NOVEMBER SO

FAR. THE HOLIDAY SEASON APPROACHES, WE EXPECT THE DEMAND TO
INCREASE AT THE SITE AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THIS
INCREASE. AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS PREPARE TO GATHER FOR
THANKSGIVING, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO INCORPORATE THE TESTING INTO
THEIR PRE AND POST HOLIDAY PLANNING AND IF PEOPLE ARE UNVACCINATED
TO WEAR MASKS IN GATHERING INDOORS. AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE
CITY'S COVID 19 TESTING PROGRAM, INCLUDING HOURS ARE AVAILABLE
ONLINE.
REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING THE SEASON FOR RIVERBEND
PARK, HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH DCR AND WE WERE NOTIFIED DCR WILL
BE EXPANDING THE RIVERBEND PARK SEASON THROUGH DECEMBER 19,
2021. THIS INCLUDES BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, WEATHER PERMITTING.
I WANT TO THANK JOE, AND ORDERS FOR THEIR COLLABORATION ON MAKING
THIS POSSIBLE. AND THE COUNCIL FOR MAKING THIS A PRIORITY. AND
EARLIER THIS FALL, THEY EXTENDED OUTDOOR DINING LICENSE THROUGH
THE WINTER UNTIL APRIL 1, 2022. IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S EXPIRATION
DATE WITH THE MEASURES FOR OUTDOOR DINING. LAST WEEK, WE
ANNOUNCED UPDATES TO THE ANNUAL OUTDOOR DINING POLICY. THIS
UPDATED POLICY CONTINUES TO EXPAND OUTDOOR DINING ONCE THE
RELIEF MEASURES EXPIRE ON APRIL 1. HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS POLICY INCLUDE
THE USE OF PUBLIC STREETS, CONTINUED USE OF SIDEWALK AND ABILITY TO
EXTEND THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR AND EXPANSION OF
PATIO HEATER PROGRAM. AND A NUMBER OF THE CHANGES WERE NOT AN
OPTION FOR THE RESTAURANT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. SINCE JUNE...
OVER 100 EXPANDING INTO ROADWAY OR ADJACENT PARKING LOTS. AND I
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK THE STAFF HAS ACCOMPLISHED
AND CONTINUE TO PUT AND UPDATING AND IMPLEMENTING THIS POLICY,
INCLUDING THE MOBILE DEPARTMENT TEAM MADE OF THE LICENSE
COMMISSION, TRAFFIC AND PARKING, DPW, THE LAW OFFICE, FIRE
DEPARTMENT, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, INSPECTIONAL AND STAFF FROM
MY OFFICE. AND I THANK THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN A
TRUE PARTNER AS THEY COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES AND
GUIDELINES AND CONTINUE TO ADAPT BY PROVIDING SAFE, INNOVATIVE
SPACES TO OUR COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER.

City’s 22-CityView and the
Cambridge Public School’s
educational cable station, CEATV for capital equipment
purchases and upgrades.

OUR RESTAURANTS ARE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET AND FACE
UNPREDICTABLE WINTER. THE CITY WILL DO ALL IT CAN DO TO HELP AND
SUPPORT LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE TRYING
TIMES. AS A REMINDER, WE PUT OUT TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE
WEBSITE, PROVIDE ACCESS DATA, AND SHARE INFORMATION DAILY WITH THE
COMMUNITY THROUGH OUR EMAIL UPDATES. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO
SHARING INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITH THE COUNCIL IN THE
WEEKLY DIGEST. WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DATA FROM THE
COMMONWEALTH AND WORK WITH CITY DEPARTMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH
OFFICIALS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE WE
SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY AS
WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER

TO SUE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE? THANKS.
>> SUE BREEN: YES. JUST LIKE THE CAMERAS ON ZOOM. I APPRECIATE BEING
HERE TO GIVE YOU THIS UPDATE. FIRST SLIDE. HERE IS THE MIDDLESEX
COUNTY AND CAMBRIDGE CASES BY RISK CATEGORY. BEFORE I LEFT, THIS
CHART HAS ALREADY CHANGED AND WE ARE NOW BACK IN THE HIGH RISK
CATEGORY. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF EVENTS DRIVING THE CAMBRIDGE
NUMBERS AND WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE IN CASES TO PEOPLE SPENDING
MORE TIME INDOORS DUE TO THE WEATHER AND WANING IMMUNITY FOR
PEOPLE THAT GOT VACCINATED EARLIER. WE PROMOTE VACCINATIONS AS
THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTECTIVE MEASURE AGAINST COVID 19 AND WE
RECOMMEND KEEPING THE MASK MANDATE IN PLACE.
NEXT SLIDE. SINCE THE OCTOBER 18 CITY COUNCIL MEETING WHEN WE
REVIEWED VACCINATION RATES, WE HAVE SEEN THE NUMBER GOES UP
AMONG ALL RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. THE RANGE IS 2 PERCENTAGE
POINTS TO 9% POINTS FOR RESIDENTS DEPENDING ON THE RACIAL
BACKGROUND. AS OF LAST WEEK, 80% OF CITY RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT
LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE.
NEXT SLIDE. VACCINATION BY AGE. THIS TABLE SHOWS THE NEWLY ELIGIBLE,
5 11 AGE GROUP. THIS 11% FIGURE DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CHILDREN IN THE
AGE GROUP THAT WERE VACCINATED AT THE LAST CLINIC, WEDNESDAY,
WHICH I WILL TALK MORE ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT. SINCE OUR LAST
PRESENTATION, FOUR WEEKS AGO, WE HAVE SEEN A 1 3 GAIN IN
CATEGORIES, EXCEPT FOR THE 12 15 YEAR OLDS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE
GREATER THAN 95% CATEGORY.
WE HAD OUR FIRST COVID AND FLU CLINIC VACCINE FOR CHILDREN AT THE
KING OPEN SCHOOL. CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE CITY HOSTED
THIS VACCINE ON NOVEMBER 10. AND THE SECOND DOSE CLINIC IS
SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 1. WE ADMINISTERED OVER A THOUSAND COVID
AND FLU VACCINE DURING THE FOUR HOUR WINDOW OF THE CLINIC. IT WAS
A GREAT COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR
PARTNERS, INCLUDING FIRE, POLICE, AND TRAFFIC.
PEDIATRIC COVID VACCINES FOR KIDS AGES 5 11 REPRESENTED ABOUT 75%
OF THE VACCINATIONS GIVEN. WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE THE NUMBERS SINCE
THE CHILDREN WERE THE MAIN TARGET FOR THIS CLINIC. WE ALSO
ADMINISTERED 136 FLU VACCINES ACROSS THE AGE GROUPS, A TOTAL OF
13%. WHEN WE ADD THE NUMBER OF CAMBRIDGE CHILDREN WHO GOT
VACCINATED AT THE WEDNESDAY CLINIC, WITH THE STATE DATA SHOWING
HOW MANY ARE VACCINATED AT OTHER LOCATIONS, THAT BRINGS US TO
ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR 5 11 YEAR OLDS ALREADY HAVING RECEIVED
THEIR FIRST DOSE. WE ARE PLANNING FOR ADDITIONAL SERIES OF PEDIATRIC
COVID VACCINE CLINICS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS.
NEXT SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE. THIS MAP SHOWS WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD
CHILDREN THAT GOT THE VACCINES CAME FROM AS WELL AS THE LOCATION
OF THE KING OPEN SCHOOL. THE KING OPEN IS ONE OF THE FEW LOCATIONS

PAGE 21

May 24, 2021

THAT CAN HANDLE MASS VACCINATION CLINICS, GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF
THE PANDEMIC. AS YOU CAN SEE, FAMILIES CAME FROM ALL ACROSS THE
CITY. WE ARE LOOKING AT OPTIONS TO USE THE CRLS FIELDHOUSE AND
OTHER AREAS OF THE SCHOOL THAT MAY PROVIDE BETTER CLINICAL SETUP IN
TERMS OF SPACE AND FLOW AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LINE UP INSIDE AS
THE WEATHER GETS COLDER.
SOME OF THE TAKEAWAYS. THESE ARE WHAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT AS OUR
PLUS DELTA THAT WE DO AFTER ANY EVENT THAT WE HAVE. LOOK AT WHAT
WENT WELL AND LOOK AT WHAT CAN USE IMPROVEMENT. WHAT WENT
WELL? WE ADMINISTERED OVER A THOUSAND VACCINES. OUR OUTREACH
WITH CPS, THE CITY, AND OTHER COMMUNITY CHANNELS, SUCCESSFULLY
REACHED CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SCHOOL LOCATION DREW FAMILIES
FROM ACROSS THE CITY. VACCINATORS SPENT TIME AND HAD THE TIME TO
SPEND COMFORTING CHILDREN, WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF CAN BE A DELTA
I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. AND A STRONG PARTNERSHIP MODEL
WITH FIRE AND POLICE.
SOME OF THE CHANGES. I JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY HERE, WE DID JUST HAVE
OUR FIRST DEBRIEFING AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE COVID, WE'LL BE
CHANGING AS WE CONTINUE TO MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO, OUR FOCUS
FOR THE COVID 19 VACCINATION WILL BE A PEDIATRIC POPULATION AND
WE'LL BE PROVIDING SECOND DOSES. A APPOINTMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED
AND INCREASING STAFF FOR VACCINE PREPARATION.
AGAIN, THIS WAS OUR FIRST DEBRIEFING AND IT'S ACTUAL LY WILL BECOME
MORE ACCURATE AND MORE PRECISE AS WE CONTINUE TO MEET. WE HAVE
YET TO MEET WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS. THIS WAS JUST OUR FIRST PASS
WITH PARTNERS AND WE'LL BE MEETING WITH FIRE AND EMS TO GET THEIR
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL.
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE CAME ACROSS THAT WE TRIED TO
ANTICIPATE WAS THE WAIT. THERE IS ALWAYS A WAIT IN THE BEGINNING OF
A FLU VACCINE, NO MATTER WHAT NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF CLINIC YOU
ARE HAVING. PEOPLE RUSH TO GET THEIR EARLY. THEY WANT TO BE THE
FIRST IN LINE. EVEN WITH MAKING APPOINTMENTS, THE SAME THING
HAPPENS. WHEN YOU HAVE A PREDOMINANTLY PEDIATRIC CLINIC, THAT
CHANGES THE PROCESS DRAMATICALLY. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, WE TALKED
ABOUT THE DRILL THAT WE HAD IN PRACTICING OUR CLINIC, WE GOT THE
AVERAGE PERSON AND/OR FAMILY THROUGH IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, BUT
MOSTLY THOSE WERE ADULTS. THAT'S THE AVERAGE TIME IT TOOK TO GO
FROM REGISTRATION TO GETTING OUT THE DOOR.
WHEN YOU HAVE A PREDOMINANTLY PEDIATRIC CLINIC WITH CHILDREN WHO
ARE 5 11 YEARS OLD, OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE ANTICIPATORY ANXIETY, IT
DRAMATICALLY CHANGES HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU TO VACCINATE THAT
CHILD.
AND SO, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FIVE MINUTES IN AND OUT, UNDER ONE
CIRCUMSTANCE, IN THIS CLINIC AND MANY OTHER CLINICS WHERE WE
VACCINATE CHILDREN IT CAN CONTAIN UP TO 25 MINUTES TO VACCINATE


PAGE 22

May 24, 2021

ONE CHILD. WE PROVIDE RESOURCES AT THE CLINIC. WE HAVE WHAT WE
CALL QUIET ROOMS, SOMETIMES IT TAKES TWO NURSES AND THE FAMILY SO
WE CAN PROVIDE AS TRAUMA FREE EXPERIENCE FOR THE KIDS THAT
ANTICIPATE THEY WILL GET STUCK WITH A NEEDLE AND ARE NOT VERY
HAPPY.
NO MATTER HOW WE TRY TO ANTICIPATE THAT, ESPECIALLY DEPENDING ON
THE SIZE OF THE CLINIC, IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET A PRECISE IDEA OF WHAT
THE FLOW WILL BE LIKE. NEXT SLIDE.
HERE IS SOME FEEDBACK I GOT FROM SOMEONE WHO GOT A SHOT, AFTER
WAITING FOR A WHILE, I THINK HE WAS THERE FOR 45 MINUTES. SUPER
COOL, YOU ALL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DID LAST NIGHT. I
KNOW ENOUGH CREDIT IS NOT GIVEN FOR THE ALL WORK YOU HAVE TO
ENDURE. A NICE GUY FROM A CAMBRIDGE TATTOO PARLOR. NEXT SLIDE.
I'D LIKE TO SHARE THIS REFLECTION FROM CHIEF RAY VAILLANCOURT. A
STEADFAST PARTNER ALONG WITH MANY MEMBERS OF EMS AND FIRE. I
SENT OUT A LETTER TO THE CHIEFS AND ACKNOWLEDGING AND TO THE CITY
MANAGER, THANKING THEM FOR THE SUPPORT FOR THIS CLINIC. AND THIS IS
WHAT DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF HAD SAID.
I BELIEVE THE LION SHARE OF THANKS GO TO FOLKS WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
THERE, WHO HAVE VOLUNTARY CONTINUED TO RUN THE VACCINE TEAM ALL
THROUGH A MARATHON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE FINISH LINE IS. IT
IS IN THE HIGH OF THE TRADITION OF FIRE SERVICES THAT OFFICERS AND FIRE
FIGHTERS IN THIS EMAIL KNOWINGLY SIGNED UP FOR A VACCINE CLINIC,
WHICH REQUIRED AN INTENSE LEVEL OF FOCUS WHILE MAINTAINING A CALM
ATMOSPHERE FOR FAMILIES ATTENDING. THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE
UNDERSTAFFED AND SUBJECT TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT WAITING. AT WHICH
THEY STOOD NO CHANCE OF GETTING A BREAK.
AND WHICH THEY COULD BE DEALING WITH SCREAMING KIDS AND ANXIOUS
PARENTS. THE HEROS TOOK ON A STRESSFUL AND INTENSE DETAIL WHEN
THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHER OVERTIME AVAILABLE WITHIN A FIRE
FIGHTER'S COMFORT ZONES. 20 MONTHS IN, I'M PROUD OF HOW THE
MEMBERS CONTINUE TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. I
COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER MYSELF.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL. DO FOLKS HAVE
QUESTIONS? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I KNOW WE ARE DOING BOOSTER
SHOTS AT THE CHA. THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCONNECT WITH THE TIME
THAT PATRONS ARE TOLD TO GO AND THE TIME THE CLINIC OPENS UP. A
PERSON FAMILIAL MEMBER OF MINE WENT AT 8:00 BECAUSE THAT WAS
THE TIME SHE WAS TOLD TO REPORT. THE CLINIC DIDN'T OPEN UNTIL 8:30.


PAGE 23

May 24, 2021

IF IT IS NOT 8:00, THAT'S FINE. THE STAFF AT CHA THAT REACH OUT TO
PEOPLE SAYING YOU ARE ELIGIBLE HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION.
HAD SHE BEEN DROPPED OFF, SHE'D BE STANDING OUT THERE FOR A HALF
HOUR. I BRING THAT UP TO SAY WE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE AND I'M
HAPPY WE'RE HAVING THESE BOOSTER SHOT OPPORTUNITIES. I KNOW WE'RE
DOING YEOMAN'S WORK SO DON'T TAKE IT AS A CRITICISM. JUST AN
OBSERVATION THAT PEOPLE WERE TOLD, SHE IN PARTICULAR AND A FEW
OTHERS, HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU CAN GO AS EARLY AS 8:00. WHEN THEY GOT
THERE, SHE AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AT 8:00, HAD TO WAIT UNTIL 8:30. IT
DIDN'T OPEN UNTIL 8:30. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO GET PEOPLE COME AND
NOT BE DISMAYED, PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS NO SEATING, CAN WE
JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED AND I'M NOT NECESSARILY
LOOKING FOR A RESPONSE. PLEASE BE MINDFUL THIS SEEMS TO BE A
DISCONNECT IN THE INFORMATION. PATIENTS WHAT IS HAPPENING?
>> I HEAR YOU AND I AGREE WITH YOU. FOR CLARIFICATION, ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT THE CLINICS THAT ARE RUN AT THE CHA SITE? OR THE ONES
THAT HAVE BEEN CO RUN BY THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT?
THE TIMES DON'T LINE UP AND MAYBE THAT'S
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WANT TO CALL IT TARGET? SOMERVILLE SITE.
>> CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE. I'M HAPPY TO PASS ON TO MAKE SURE
THEIR INFORMATION IS ACCURATE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU.
>> CITY MANAGER: I HAVE A MEETING WITH THEM AND I WILL TALK WITH
THEM AS WELL.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. FIRST, MY THANKS TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND STAFF FOR GETTING THE EXTENSION, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THE VACCINE
NUMBERS UP. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING CAREFULLY AT
THE DATA. I'M GETTING CONCERNED THAT THE CASE COUNTS ARE
INCREASING AGAIN. AND WE'RE HEADING INTO THE WINTER. THE BEST
PROTECTION IS THE VACCINE AND I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME ON THAT.
WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
20 29 YEAR OLD DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE THAT GROUP SEEMS TO BE
LAGGING BEHIND IN VACCINATIONS.
THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE POPULATION THAT SEEMS TO
BE WHAT IS DRAGGING DOWN THE OVERALL NUMBERS. THE QUESTION IS
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TRY THAT TO ADDRESS THAT DEMOGRAPHICS TO
GET THE NUMBERS TO GO UP?
>> SUE BREEN: WE LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND TARGET OUR
EFFORTS WITH THE DATA. RIGHT NOW, OUR EFFORTS ARE GEARED
TOWARDS, AT LEAST NOW AND THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS, GIVEN THE
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE, THEY ARE FOR THE CHILDREN, 5 11 YEAR OLDS.
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE GETTING THE SUPPLIES FOR VACCINES WHY WE ARE
GETTING THE SUPPLIES FOR THE VACCINE. THIS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATE FOR


PAGE 24

May 24, 2021

THAT GROUP. WE DO HAVE THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE WHO IS VERY
GENEROUS TO US SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO VACCINATE OTHER
POPULATIONS. POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY WHO WE ARE
TARGETING AT THIS MOMENT OF TIME. WE HAVE THIS WINDOW OF EFFORT
FOR THE CHILDREN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE DON'T TAKE OUR EYE
OFF WHERE THE GAPS ARE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT. I JUST WANT
TO BE CLEAR RIGHT NOW, THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS AND AFTER THE
HOLIDAYS, OUR MAJOR FOCUS IN OUR CLINICS ARE BUILT AROUND
VACCINATING CHILDREN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M CERTAINLY NOT SPEAKING
AGAINST THAT AT ALL. WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, I SEE ABOUT 10,000
OF 20 29 YEAR OLDS NOT VACCINATED OUT OF 34,000 35,000. THAT'S A
REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE POPULATION. I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING IN TERMS OF TARGETING THE 5 11 YEAR OLD AND THAT
MAKES SENSE TO ME. I SUSPECT THAT YOU'LL BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN
ADDRESSING THAT POPULATION.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING MORE TO GET TO THE 20 29
YEAR OLDS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CASE COUNTS, THAT'S THE SAME
DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE YOU SEE MOST OF THE NEW CASES. I REALLY
ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN TARGET THAT
AGE DEMOGRAPHIC TO GET OUR VACCINATIONS UP.
MY SECOND QUESTION IS AROUND THE BOOSTERS. I'M NOT SEEING DATA ON
THAT ON THE DATA PORTAL. IS THAT AVAILABLE? CAN WE BEGIN TO SEE
WHO IS GETTING BOOSTERS AND HOW WE'RE DOING ON THAT FRONT?
>> I WILL ASK IF WE CAN GET ANNA, OUR DIRECTOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGIST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SHE IS HERE. GO AHEAD.
>> HI. AT THIS TIME, DATA COME FROM DPH. THEY HAVE NOT YET RELEASED
ANYTHING AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. OR NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. ONCE IT
IS, WE'LL FORWARD IT OVER TO THE CAMBRIDGE DATA CENTER. WE CAN'T
PULL THAT OURSELVES. IT COMES FROM THE STATE DATABASE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I LOOK
FORWARD TO SEEING THAT DATA. OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ANOTHER GROUP
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO LOTS OF OUTREACH TO GET
PARTICULARLY OUR SENIORS WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED EARLIER IN THE
YEAR TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THEIR BOOSTERS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE
PROTECTED. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN VICE MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND
FOR THE UPDATE. I ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE VACCINATION OF THE
VARIOUS AGE GROUPS. I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT DATA PRESENTED. IT IS
IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. MY QUESTION IS


PAGE 25

May 24, 2021

AROUND YOU MENTION A MASK MANDATE IS SOMETHING YOU
RECOMMEND. AND WHILE THE DATA DOES SHOW MASKS HAVE AN IMPACT,
IT IS A BUCKET OF OTHER THINGS IN THE VACCINATION RATES ARE TIED TO
THE PLACES AROUND THE GLOBE THAT MANAGED TO HOLD IT DOWN. WE
SAW WITH OUR OWN, WE PUT A MASK MANDATE IN, IT DIDN'T PREVENT THE
LATEST UPTICKS. WHAT IS THE THINKING ON AS THE VACCINATION RATES
TICK UP AND WE GET MORE VACCINATED, WHAT IS THE THINKING ON WHEN
IS IT WE MIGHT SEE THE RETURN TO NORMAL IN RETURNS OF NOT HAVING
THE MASK MANDATE IN PLACE, IN PARTICULAR MIGHT THERE BE ONE FOR
VACCINATED VERSUS UNVACCINATED PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHAT SOME PLACES
ARE LOOKING AT NOW?
>> SUE BREEN: I WILL LET DR. DOBBERTEEN WEIGH IN. AS WE MENTIONED
LAST TIME, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VARIABLE THE TO CONSIDER. I DO
THINK WE WANT TO GET, AT THE VERY LEAST, THROUGH THIS SEASON OF
GATHERING TO SEE WHAT THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE. I WOULD LIKE LISA, DR.
DOBBERTEEN, TO WEIGH IN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DR. DOBBERTEEN?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO BE
CONSIDERED AS WELL AS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS
VACCINATED. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THINS TO CONSIDER.
WE HAVE PEOPLE MOVING INDOORS WITH THE ADVENT OF THE COLD
WEATHER. WE HAVE DELTA VARIANT THAT IS STILL WITH US. AND
TRANSMISSION AMONG VACCINATED PEOPLE WITH BREAKTHROUGH CASES.
AND WE HAVE THE HOLIDAY GATHERINGS ON TOP OF THE TENDENCY OF
PEOPLE TO BE INDOORS. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT CASE NUMBERS ARE SIMILAR
TO LAST YEAR, JUST PRIOR TO THE HOLIDAYS.
I THINK WE ARE APPROACHING THE MASK MANDATE THOUGHTFULLY, BUT IN
CONJUNCTION WITH LOOKING AT VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE IMPACT OF
COVID ON THE COMMUNITY. SO WE'LL LOOK AT BOTH THE RATES OF
TRANSMISSION, RATES OF TRANSMISSION IN MIDDLESEX COUNTY AROUND
US AS WELL AS OUR RATES OF VACCINATION.

>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS A QUESTION THAT WE WERE
ASKED WEEKLY. I THINK WE SAID TWO WEEKS AGO, IT WOULDN'T BE EARLIER
THAN THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY. I THINK THAT'S A TARGET, BUT OBVIOUSLY
WE MONITOR IT. WE ARE DISCUSSING IT, BUT AT THE EARLIEST, WE
DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. THAT IS PROBABLY EARLIER
THAN PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN, TO BE HONEST.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. AS MUCH AS I DON'T LIKE THE
ANSWER OF IT BEING LATER, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE SET EXPECTATIONS.
I'D LOVE US TO GET TO A POINT WHERE IF WE REACH CERTAIN MILESTONES
WE CANNOT HAVE THE MASK MANDATE ANYMORE. MY SECOND QUESTION
IS ON HOW WE MEASURE THE HEALTH OF SMALL BUSINESS AND OTHER
EMPLOYERS, THE CITY MANAGER MENTIONED WE KNOW RESTAURANTS AND

PAGE 26

May 24, 2021

OTHERS ARE STRUGGLING. NOT JUST RESTAURANTS, THERE ARE BUSINESSES
IN THE CITY THAT ARE STRUGGLING. DO WE HAVE A WAY AND A MEASURE IN
PLACE TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH OF THE VARIOUS SECTORS, NOT JUST
THE ONES WE SEE, WHICH ARE THE RESTAURANTS ON THE STREET WITH
PARKING SPOTS AND THE PATIOS. BUT MANY OTHER ENGINES OF OUR
ECONOMY HERE, OTHER THAN THE LARGE ONES THAT BEE KNOW MAKE
NATIONAL NEWS WITH PROFITS IN THE BIOTECH. WE RELY ON THE BASE AND
I WONDER IF WE HAVE A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT THEY ARE
DOING AND THEREFORE WAY TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY NEED MORE
SUPPORT FROM US.
>> CITY MANAGER: I KNOW COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A ROLE IN
THAT. I THINK THEY MAY BE ON THE LINE BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME
APPROPRIATIONS THAT RELAY TO CD. I KNOW MATT NELSON IS MY
EXTENSION TO HIM. MATT, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING TO ADD. IF THEY
ARE NOT, I CAN GET YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING AND GET BACK TO YOU. I
THINK MATT IS UP HERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MATT IS COMING TO THE PODIUM.
>> CITY MANAGER: THANK YOU.
>> MATT NELSON: THANK YOU. AS A CITY MANAGER MENTIONED,
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIVISION IS
LOOKING AT THIS DATA AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING OFF THE TOP OF MY
HEAD. WE CAN GET THAT BACK TO YOU. I KNOW FOR A YEAR AND HALF, WE
HAD THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING ACTIVELY AND
THE BIWEEKLY SMALL BUSINESS OPEN OFFICE HOURS. AND WE HEARD FROM
ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES ABOUT THE STRUGGLES. WE HAVE THE
PROGRAMS THAT ARE STILL RUNNING FOR RETAIL IN TERMS OF THE PICK IT
UP ZONES AND OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE FOR PICKUP AND DELIVERY, NOT
WITH RESTAURANTS, RETAIL, AND BOOK STORES AND OUR GRANT
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GONE ON THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. WE'LL
CONTINUE IN OTHER WAYS AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT THE FUNDS AND
ALL OF THAT. I CAN GET YOU A FULLER REPORT AND WORK ON THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE DO HAVE FOLKS FROM CDD.
>> THANK YOU. I SEE MATT DID A GREAT JOB OF TALKING ABOUT HITTING
ALL THE HIGH POINTS. MS. FAROOQ SPEAKING. WE ARE WORKING WITH
BIPOC ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND WE JUST HAD A MEETING WITH THEM
TODAY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND HOW WE CAN HOW WE
CAN BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS AT THIS MOMENT, BUT ALSO LONG TERM. I
CAN CERTAINLY I DON'T HAVE THE DATA HANDY, I WASN'T EXPECTING THE
QUESTION. I WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH MORE INFORMATION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I DON'T MEAN TO CREATE EXTRA
WORK, IT IS GOOD TO KNOW HOW WE SUPPORT THE BUSINESSES. NOT JUST
THE ONES THAT ARE VISIBLE, BUT MANY OTHERS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. I
HAVE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES THAT
DIDN'T GET GRANTS AND STILL STRUGGLING. THE MORE WE CAN DO AND
UNDERSTAND THIS, IT IS ONGOING IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN THE

PAGE 27

May 24, 2021

ECONOMY. OF COURSE, WE HEARD AND WE'LL DISCUSS LATER HOW SO
MANY ARE SCARED WITH THE BIKE LANE CHANGES. THAT'S SEPARATE AND
ABOVE OR BEYOND. IT IS EXACERBATED BY THE FACT SO MANY ARE IN A
CHALLENGING SITUATION ANYWAY. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE
HAVE A HANDLE ON HOW WE MAY BETTER SUPPORT THEM. IF THERE IS
SOME KIND OF WAY TO GET US A REPORT, THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO VICE MAYOR MALLON AND COUNCILLOR
CARLONE.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. YOU MENTIONED THE CASE COUNTS
ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY WERE OF NOVEMBER LAST YEAR AND GOING UP.
AS WE ENTER A PANDEMIC PHASE, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOSPITALIZATIONS,
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE WE GOT IN THE MOST TROUBLE HEALTH WISE.
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND
WHETHER THEY ARE UP ALONG WITH THE CASE COUNTS OR SEEING A STEADY
AMOUNT OF HOSPITALIZATIONS IN AT THE CHA?
>> MS. BREEN: IT IS NOT UP AT CHA AT THIS TIME. DEPENDS WHERE YOU
ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT FOR CAMBRIDGE. IT IS A MARKER. IT IS A BIG
MARKER. CAN I ASK DR. DOBBERTEEN, BUT IT IS TO MY UNDERSTANDING,
WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT THE VACCINE. IT IS
KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. LET'S CHECK IN WITH DR.
DOBBERTEEN?
>> DR. LISA DOBBERTEEN: SURE. THANK YOU. THE CASE RATE OF PEOPLE
BEING HOSPITALIZED IS DEFINITELY MUCH LOWER THAN WE WERE SEEING A
YEAR AGO. PEOPLE WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED AND SUFFERING SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DISEASE ARE THE UNVACCINATED FOR THE MOST
PART. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATES STATEWIDE ARE LOWER. GREAT DEAL OF
THE DISEASE IS BREAKTHROUGH DISEASE OR DISEASE IN CHILDREN WHO UP
UNTIL RECENTLY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET VACCINATED. FORTUNATELY, THE
VACCINES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, AND VERY GOOD AT
PRESENTING SERIOUS ILLNESS, NEED FOR MECHANICAL VENTILATION,
HOSPITALIZATION, AND DEATH. FORTUNATELY.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I THINK IT IS HARD WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE ONE DATA POINT OF CASE COUNTS. WE LOOK AT THEM FOR SO
LONG, NOW THERE ARE VACCINATIONS, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO
ADD IN OTHER DATA AROUND HOSPITALIZATIONS JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND.
JUST LOOKING AT THE ONE DATA POINT IS HARD.
>> CITY MANAGER: I KNOW AT THE BOARD MEETING, THERE ARE UPDATES
TO WE CAN CERTAINLY GET SOME INFORMATION. THE HOSPITALS ARE
KEEPING TRACK.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. WE
SPOKE ABOUT THE FIFTH DAY OF TESTING AND THE CITY MANAGER
MENTIONED THERE ARE CHALLENGES. WE MAY LOOK AT AN ALTERNATIVE
SITE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. I DIDN'T HEAR IT COME UP. I
WONDER IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT. I NEEDED A TEST ON FRIDAY. WE
DON'T HAVE A TESTING SITE FRIDAY OR SATURDAY. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

PAGE 28

May 24, 2021

FOR ME TO OBTAIN A TEST THAT WAS IN CAMBRIDGE. I HAD TO GO TO
MALDEN. THE ONLY OPTION WERE THROUGH MALDEN. HAVING THAT FIFTH
DAY WOULD BE SO CRITICAL. I'M CURIOUS WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT?
>> CITY MANAGER: IN CONTINUED DISCUSSION WITH CIC. THEY ARE FACING
CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING. THEY ARE NOT 100% SURE THEY CAN MEET
OUR NEEDS. THEY HAVE COME UP WITH AN INTERESTING IDEA THAT MAYBE
WE USE THEIR SITE AS A SITE TO ELIMINATE THE TRANSPORTATION. BUT
THESE ARE THINGS IN DISCUSSION. I DO BELIEVE AND SUE CAN JUMP IN,
WE'LL GET A FIFTH DAY. WE'RE EXACTLY IT MIGHT BE AND WHEN WE'LL GET
IT, NOT AS QUICKLY AS WE'D LIKE. I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING AN
ANNOUNCEMENT SOON THAT WE'LL SEND THE COUNCIL. I KNOW SHE IS
WORKING RELENTLESSLY ON THIS AND I'LL LET HER ADD SOMETHING.
>> SUE BREEN: CIC WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH A SITE. WE WERE
HOPING THAT WE COULD NEGOTIATE FOR WHERE WE'D LIKE THE SITE TO BE.
DO WE HAVE A SITE TO HAVE A SITE AND TEST PEOPLE. OR NOT HAVE A SITE
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO IT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. WE JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SITE AND IT MIGHT NOT BE AND
WHAT WE CONSIDER THE IDEAL PLACE, BUT THEY ALSO DID REFER TO IT AS A
PILOT. THAT SAYS TO ME IT WOULD BE A BEGINNING AND A PLACE TO START.
GO A PLACE TO RE EVALUATE HOW WELL IT WORKS. WE GOT THIS
INFORMATION TODAY.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: WHEN WILL WE HAVE ANY FINAL CONFIRMATION?
THANKSGIVING IS COMING UP.
>> CITY MANAGER: I WOULD HOPE WE'LL SEND SOMETHING ON FRIDAY'S
WEEKLY DIGEST ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE ARE PUSHING. THEY WANTED
TO ANNOUNCE TONIGHT AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING AND
THEN MAKE AN OBSERVATION ABOUT ANOTHER STATE, WHICH JUST
SURPRISED ME. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK COMING IN AND TAKING OVER AN
ORGANIZATION PART TIME IS SO HARD. I APPRECIATE, I'M SURE WE ALL DO,
THE POSITIVITY NATURE AND WILLINGNESS TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND BE AS
RESPONSIVE AS YOU CAN BE RIGHT FROM THE START. I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH THAT. YOU DON'T NORMALLY HEAR THAT, BUT I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE
FEEL THAT WAY.
I WENT TO NEWPORT FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION, I WAS STUNNED
BY THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT MASKS ON. I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS
AND I'M SHARING IT. THE SIGNS ON THE DOOR SAID... IF YOU ARE
VACCINATED, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WEAR A MASK INSIDE. I GOT TO TELL
YOU, I'M A CONSERVATIVE GUY, FOR PUBLIC HEALTH I'M CONSERVATIVE,
MOST OTHER THINGS, I'M PROUDLY NOT. IT WAS SHOCKING AND DIFFICULT
TO GET USED TO. WHAT I WANT TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
IN RHODE ISLAND, BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE BEING CAREFUL.
AND ANY QUESTIONS YOU GET IS MORE CLARIFICATION OF WHERE WE ARE


PAGE 29

May 24, 2021

AND CAN WE DO BETTER AND ALL OF THAT. WHAT I SEE REPORTED, WEEK
AFTER WEEK, IS IMPRESSIVE. OBVIOUSLY, THE RECENT RISE IS OF CONCERN
AND I KNOW WE'LL BE KEPT UP TO DATE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND
YOUR DEPARTMENT AND GIVEN THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS REALLY TO HELP
CAMBRIDGE, THIS WAS NOT NECESSARILY A CAREER CHOICE, SHOULD BE
ACKNOWLEDGED. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OTHER QUESTIONS? I DON'T SEE ANY. I'LL JUST SAY, I
WAS WONDERING ABOUT THE BOOSTER DATA AS WELL. I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE CLINICS THAT YOU ALL DID AS RESERVOIR CHURCH. I THINK IT
WAS APRIL. AND ALL WERE J & J. I GOT J & J, AFTER ANY ADULT, TWO
MONTHS AFTER, IS RECOMMENDED TO GET A BOOSTER. WE COLLECTED
EMAILS THAT DAY. HAVE WE BEEN SENDING INFORMATION ABOUT HAVE
YOU GOTTEN YOUR BOOSTER. HERE IS INFORMATION ON HOW. WE'RE NOT
DOING BOOSTER SPECIFIC CLINICS. IT WAS EASY TO GET ONE AT CVS. I HAVE
BEEN HELPING OTHER PEOPLE GET IT AND MY OFFICE IS HAPPY TO DO THAT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF RESIDENTS WHO CAME FROM RINDGE TOWER, OTHER
PLACES. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT JOHNSON &
JOHNSON, WE HAVE JOHNSON & JOHNSON CPH CLINICS, I WONDER HOW WE
GET THE FOLKS AWARE OF THE BOOSTER.
>> SUE BREEN: I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS DO A BETTER JOB AT
COMMUNICATION. AND I THINK ONE THING THAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR
DEBRIEFING IS LOOKING AT OTHER PARTNERS WE HAVEN'T USED BEFORE.
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS KIND OF WE FUNCTION LIKE COVID. WE CHANGED
CONSTANTLY TO TRY AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES. YES,
WE'LL DO BOOSTERS. WE HAVE TO FUNCTION AS A HEALTH DEPARTMENT
BASED ON I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD RESOURCES BECAUSE IN THIS
TIME, WE HAVE AN AMAZING GROUP OF RESOURCES IN TERMS OF HUMAN
CAPITAL. WHAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON ALSO ARE THE VACCINES. AND WE
DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THE VACCINES.
THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T SHOW UP AT THE TIME WHEN
PEOPLE WANT THEM TO.
IT IS PART OF THE PLAN. WE LOOK AT BETTER WAYS TO MESSAGE AND MAKE
SURE THEY WE USE OTHER AVENUES THAT WE HAVEN'T USED BEFORE, NOT
JUST RELYING ON THE CITY WEBSITE AND NOT JUST RELYING ON TWITTER
AND ACTUALLY LOOKING AT WAYS WE CAN HELP PEOPLE SIGN UP AND GET
MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO GET PEOPLE SIGNED UP AND GET WHAT
THEY NEED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'D LOVE TO ANY WAY MY OFFICE CAN HELP, MAKING
PHONE CALLS TO THE SPECIFIC PEOPLE. I KNOW BE CAREFUL ABOUT
SHARING INFORMATION AND ALL THAT STUFF. IF THERE IS ANY WAY WE CAN
LET THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON, IN PARTICULAR, THE CLINICS WE DID, GET
THAT INFORMATION OUT. WHETHER SPECIFIC POSTCARDS TO THAT
POPULATION. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO REALLY MAKE SURE FOLKS ARE
AWARE OF THAT. IF YOU GOT JOHNSON & JOHNSON, TWO MONTHS, YOU
CAN GET A BOOSTER. THAT IS THE BIG PART I WANTED TO HARP ON. I WILL
DEFINITELY OUR OFFICE WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO HELP MAKE

APPOINTMENTS. ANY NEW STRATEGIES, HOPEFULLY WE CAN BRAINSTORM.
AND ECHOING AROUND THE FIFTH SITE. I HAVE BEEN BUGGING THE CITY
MANAGER ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE. WE HAVE BEEN CLOSE. THERE'S BEEN
SETBACKS, HOPEFULLY, FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL HAVE A FIFTH SITE. THANK
YOU FOR THE WORK ON THAT. NO OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE TEAM, SO
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE AND WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AS WE HEARD ON OTHER ITEMS
RELATIVE TO BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, WE ARE KEEN ON SAFE BIKE
TRANSPORTATION. THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CHORUS OF VOICES THAT
SPEAK TO THE LEVEL OF OUTREACH THAT WE HAD. I'M INTERESTED, IF I MAY,
TO HEAR FROM CITY MANAGER IN TERMS OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WORK
THAT WE'D LIKE TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY FOR, WHICH WILL IMPROVE OR
EXTEND THE BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT TYPES OF OUTREACH DID WE DO
TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS?
>> CITY MANAGER: I ASK THE PUBLIC WORKS TEAM THE EXACT SAME
QUESTION. I WILL HAVE THEM AND THEY ARE BOTH ON THE LINE. I DON'T
KNOW IF KATHY WANTS TO TAKE THE LEAD. IT IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.
KATHY?
>> THANK YOU. THE WORK WAS EVOLVED OUT OF THE GLATKIN FIELD
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT. WE HAD A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY

May 24, 2021

MEETINGS, THREE MEETINGS THAT WERE WELL ATTENDED. AND WE ALSO
DID OUTREACH WITH THE FRESH POND ADVISORY BOARD AS WELL AS THE
WATER BOARD BECAUSE THERE ARE KEY CONSTITUENTS ALONG THE
CORRIDOR. AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF OUTREACH EFFORTS ON THE PARK
AND ON THE HURON DESIGN ITSELF. THE DESIGN OF HURON AVENUE, IT IS
ABOUT THE SAFE BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT ALSO ABOUT CREATING
SIDEWALKS ALONG THAT SECTION OF HURON AVENUE WHERE THERE ARE NO
SIDEWALKS AND ADDING ADDITIONAL CROSSWALKS SO PEOPLE CAN
CONNECT FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE RESERVATION AS WELL AS
TRANSIT IMPROVEMENT. IT IS A LAYERED PROJECT IN TERMS OF THE TYPES
OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WERE INCORPORATED AND THROUGH THE
OUTREACH EFFORTS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THIS MONEY REPRESENTS BICYCLE
INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS AND A FEW OTHER
ITEMS? I CAN'T SEE THE DETAILS BEHIND IT. I'M GOING TO ASK? IS THAT
CORRECT?
>> KATHY WATKINS: IT IS $2.6, PAVING, THE NEW BIKE FACILITIES, TRANSIT
AMENITIES, NEW SIDEWALK ALONG HURON AVENUE AND PART OF THE
FUNDING ALLOWS, THIS IS ABOUT $400,000, DURING THE DESIGN, THERE
WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS WE NEED TO ADD INTO THE SCOPE. IT
ORIGINALLY ENDED RIGHT AT GLATKIN FIELD AND WE GOT INTO THE DETAILS,
WE REALIZE FROM A PEDESTRIAN PERSPECTIVE AND FOR CYCLISTS, IT MADE
SENSE TO EXTEND IT THROUGH THE GOLF COURSE AND THROUGH THE NEXT
BUS STOP. WE HAD A MORE LOGICAL ENDING PLACE FOR PEOPLE WALKING
AND BIKING ALONG HURON AVENUE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: ONE OTHER QUESTION, IF I MAY. WE LEADER
FROM THE SENIOR COMMUNITY, OUR AGING COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE
WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS. I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW
THOROUGH WAS THE OUTREACH TO THE TWO COMMUNITIES AROUND THIS
PROJECT? PARTICULARLY, ABOUT THIS ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE OF
MONEY?
>> KATHY WATKINS: IT WASN'T SPECIFIC OUTREACH ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL
FUNDING. THE OUTREACH WAS REALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL
PROJECT. AND THIS PROJECT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE
OTHER PROJECTS IN THE SENSE OF HURON IS WIDER, GIVEN ALL THINGS WE
WANT TO DO, WE ARE ABLE TO KEEP ABOUT 80% OF THE PARKING. THE
PARKING IMPACTS ON THIS SECTION OF HURON ARE LESS THAN OTHER
STREET CORRIDORS. AND ONE THING THIS PROJECT IS DOING IS ALLOWING
THE PARKING THAT IS ON THE RESERVATION SIDE OF THE STREET TO BE
ACCESSIBLE. CURRENTLY, IF YOU GO OUT, THERE'S NO SIDEWALK ON THE
SIDE OF HURON, ALONG THE RESERVATION. IF YOU PARK THERE, YOU GET
OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND THERE'S A PATH, BUT NO ACCESSIBLE SIDEWALK TO
THE PARKING. ALSO, TO THE BUS STOPS ALONG THAT SECTION. AND I
WOULD SAY ACCESSIBILITY WAS ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS BEHIND THE
IMPROVEMENTS.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM FROM THE
BODY?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I THINK THE COMMENTS ARE TO MAKE
SURE WE DO COMMUNICATE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAVE WALKED,
BIKED, AND DRIVEN THAT SECTION AND THERE ARE FURTHER QUESTIONS
ABOUT HOW FAR IT WILL GO AND WHETHER AT THE END OF HURON, THERE'S
CONCERN ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES WITH SIDEWALKS. THE MORE WE CAN
COMMUNICATE AND UNDERSTAND AND MAKE SURE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THE CITY UNDERSTANDS HOW FAR THIS GOES ALONG TOWARDS
BRINGING THAT PIECE OF HURON INTO THE 20TH CENTURY WITH SAFE
SIDEWALKS FOR EVERYBODY ALONGSIDE THE MARVELOUS RECONSTRUCTED
FIELD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE OTHER QUESTIONS. WE CAN DO A ROLL
CALL ON THE APPROPRIATION.
>> ON THE APPROPRIATION: (ROLL CALL).
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 9. PULLED BY
COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THIS REPORT, SOME I
BELIEVE WAS PRESENTED WITH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND SINCE
UPDATED. I'M NOT SURE IF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE HAS SEEN THIS. I HAD
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS/COMMENTS. THIS IS QUITE AN EXTENSIVE LIST.
REPRESENTS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK, WHICH IS WONDERFUL TO
SEE THROUGHOUT THE CITY BY A NUMBER OF PLAYERS AROUND THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #7 ADOPTED
Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of $400,000 from
MassDOT’s FY22 Complete
Streets Program to the Public
Investment Fund Public Works
Extraordinary Expenditures
account which will be used to
support the Huron Avenue
(Glacken Field to Fresh Pond
Parkway) project

SINCE THIS BODY AND I AND MANY HAVE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO SEE
MORE HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES, 28 OUT OF THE 33 PROJECTS ARE
RENTALS AND ONLY LITERARY 1%, 28 OUT OF 2814 ARE LISTED AS HOME
OWNERSHIP. HOW CAN WE MOVE FORWARD TO HAVE THE NEXT ITERATION
OF THE LIST AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF
PROJECTS TO DO MORE ALONG THE LINES OF HOMEOWNERSHIP
OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH WHATEVER MECHANISM IT IS, LIMITED EQUITY CO
OPS AND I RECOGNIZE THIS IS ON THE EXISTING PIPELINE AND I WANT TO
HIGHLIGHT IT AS SOMETHING MANY OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND
ADDRESSED. WHEN YOU ADD THE NUMBERS, IT IS NOT WHERE I THINK WE
SHOULD BE AND I HOPE IT IS NOT WHERE THE CITY THINKS WE SHOULD BE.
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD EQUITY AND ADDRESS THE STUNNING WEALTH
GAP WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
>> MS. FAROOQ: THROUGH YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, I'M TAKING THAT AS A
COMMENT RATHER THAN A QUESTION BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY CAN TALK
ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE POLICY WISE TO ADVANCE HOMEOWNERSHIP.
TYPICALLY, WHAT WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THE RESULT OF WHAT
FUNDING AVAILABILITY LOOKS LIKE AND WHERE IT'S TARGETED. I WILL SAY,
THERE'S A HUGE NEED FOR RENTAL HOUSING AS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING


PAGE 33

May 24, 2021

CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE CHERRY STREET PARCEL. WE HAVE FOUND
THAT WHEN WE TALK TO FOCUS GROUPS OF FOLKS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE
RESIDENTS IN SOME OF THE HOUSING, THERE'S A GREAT DESIRE TO HAVE IT
BE RENTAL SO IT IS ACCESSIBLE TO A LARGER AMOUNT NUMBER OF PEOPLE.
THAT PARTICULAR SITE DOES MAKE MORE SENSE AS HOMEOWNERSHIP
GIVEN ITS SIZE. WE CERTAIN LY LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING DISCUSSION
WITH COUNCIL AROUND POLICY OPTIONS AND THIS REPORT IS SLATED TO BE
DISCUSSED AT A HOUSING COMMITTEE HEARING ON THE FIRST OF
DECEMBER AND WE CAN COME PREPARED WITH MORE INFORMATION ON
THAT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. IT WAS PARTLY A COMMENT AND
PORTLY A RESPONSE OF HOW MUCH THIS IS MOVING FORWARD. THE IDEA
THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP, NUMBER OF UNITS WOULDN'T SERVE ANY FEWER
PEOPLE AS RENTAL. SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE, BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
BUILD EQUITY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND A COMMENT THAT WILL SERVE MORE
PEOPLE IF IS RENTAL THAN HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT CAN BE THE SAME SQUARE
FOOTAGE AND UNITS. AND I HOPE AND HIGHLIGHT AND I KNOW IT CAME UP
AT THE PLANNING BOARD, THE COST PER UNIT IN THIS, LAND ACQUISITION
COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN MANY, THEY ARE HIGH AND THE MORE TO
BRING THAT DOWN, THE MORE UNITS TO PROVIDE. IF WE SPEND $400,000,
IF WE CAN COST THAT IN HALF, WE CAN PRODUCE TWICE AS MANY. I HOPE
THAT IS ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MEETING. I'M NOT
ON THE COMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK
YOU. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR NOLAN,
FOR THAT COMMENT ON HOMEOWNERSHIP. I KNOW THAT IS A HUMAN
DESIRE THE EVERY INCOME LEVEL TO FEEL THAT YOU OWN, EVEN A SMALL
PART OF WHERE YOU LIVE. I HAVE TWO DEAR FRIENDS, A COUPLE, WHO
WERE ONE OF THE FIRST TO GO INTO ONE OF THE HOMEOWNERSHIP
PROGRAMS, I THINK THAT'S 20 YEARS AGO. I DON'T REMEMBER, MS.
FAROOQ OR MR. CARTER WOULD KNOW BETTER. THEY RAISED SOMETHING
TO ME. THEY GET THEY WON'T HAVE THE EQUITY THAT OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD. THEY ARE SO GRATEFUL THE MORTGAGE THEY TAKE WILL BE PAID
OFF IN A FEW YEARS. THEIR MONTHLY COSTS WILL BE SO MUCH LESS THAN
RENTING THAT THEY ARE THRILLED. GRANTED MOST PEOPLE MAY NOT WAIT
THE FULL TERM OF A MORTGAGE, BUT THIS COUPLE HAD TWO YOUNG KIDS,
BOTH IN THEIR LATE 20S NOW. THEY ARE THRILLED WITH THE SITUATION. IT
SEEMS TO ME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COUNCILLOR NOLAN BROUGHT UP
THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO LOOK INTO IT. IF THERE IS A DEPARTMENT
PROBLEM, WHICH IS USUALLY THE ISSUE, WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO
PROGRAMS FOR THAT.
I WANTED TO MENTION THAT. THERE ARE REASONS WHY CERTAIN PROJECTS
HAVE HIGHER COSTS, SUBSOIL CONDITIONS, MANY OF THE SITES WERE NOT
IDEAL SITES TO BUILD ON WHERE THERE IS EXISTING HOUSING, AFFORDABLE
HOUSING. WE'RE PAYING THAT CHOICE AGAIN. GOING OVER SIX STORIES IS
ANOTHER BIG FACTOR. I THINK WE HAVE TO EXPLORE THAT AS A COUNCIL.


PAGE 34

May 24, 2021

WE WANT MORE HOUSING, I THINK WE SHOULD LIKE MANY OF YOU THINK
WE SHOULD BE BUILDING EVEN MORE, BUT IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY. I THINK
WE CAN GET TO THAT AND I HOPE OUR DISCUSSIONS GET TO THAT AS WELL.
I THANK THE MANAGER FOR THIS REPORT. IT IS QUITE TELLING IN MANY
WAYS AND SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED
AND BEING REVIEWED NOW. I THINK THAT IS VERY HELPFUL, MORE DETAIL IS
NEEDED TO DISCUSS IT FULLY. LIKE ALL OF YOU, I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE'RE
TOOK. ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS REFINEMENT AND MAYBE DOING IT IN A
BROADER MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE WAY ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THE
PROJECTS. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD BUY LAND LEFT AND RIGHT,
ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE'S ONE STORY BUILDINGS. THANK YOU. GOING TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I AGREE WITH IMPORTANCE OF
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND TO THAT POINT, THE COUNCIL DID PASS A REQUEST
THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS PUT FORWARD A BOND TO FUND MORE
HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST GENERATION HOME BUYERS. I
RECOGNIZE THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT MS. FAROOQ BRINGS UP. IF
WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MORE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES, WE HAVE
TO FUND THEM. THAT'S WHY WE PUT IN THE ORDER AND I HOPE WE CAN
GET THE RESPONSE ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT AND THAT FUNDING
MECHANISM AS ONE OPTION. IT IS TRUE WE HAVE MORE DEMAND FOR
RENTAL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD
HOMEOWNERSHIP IF THEY ARE HOUSING CHALLENGED. THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO CAN AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE
OPPORTUNITIES. IT DOES WORK OUT BETTER FOR PEOPLE IF THEY DON'T
HAVE TO SINK MONEY INTO RENT.
I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AND IT IS HELPFUL AND I WONDER IF WE CAN
GET THIS REPORT ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS. MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A
YEAR. AND MAYBE ON THE WEBSITE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK FOR IT, BUT
WE CAN GO TO THE WEBSITE AND SEE WHERE WE ARE WITH THESE TYPES OF
PROJECTS. IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> MS. FAROOQ: IT DID TAKE PULLING A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS TOGETHER
TO GET THIS INFORMATION. WE CERTAINLY CAN DO IT I THINK ON A
REGULAR BASIS. I DON'T THINK IT WILL CHANGE AS MUCH TO DO IT MORE
FREQUENTLY THAN ONCE A YEAR, I THINK. AS YOU CAN SEE, SOME OF THE
PROJECTS ARE GOING TO 23 OR 24 AND EVEN 25 FOR THE HOUSING
AUTHORITY. WE CAN MAKE A MORE DELIBERATE EFFORT TO GET A REPORT
TO COUNCIL ON A REGULAR BASIS ON THE PIPELINE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY
HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY IF IT CAN BE ON THE WEBSITE SO THE PUBLIC CAN
EASILY ACCESS IT AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH AS MUCH OF A
PROCESS TO GET THE INFORMATION.

CITY MANAGER’S AGENDA
ITEM #9
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-6,
regarding a report housing
development information.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANYONE ELSE. HEARING NONE, WE CAN DO ROLL CALL
ON PLACING THIS ON FILE.
>> ON THE MOTION: ROLL CALL.


PAGE 35

May 24, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: PLACE ON FILE OR REFER TO COMMITTEE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE ACTION LISTED NEXT TO IT IS PLACE ON FILE. IS
THERE A MOTION TO FORWARD IT TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THE MOTION. I THOUGHT
IN DISCUSSION WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN MADE THE MOTION. THERE'S A
MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO REFER THIS TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE FOR
FURTHER DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: POINT OF INFORMATION, ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER
MS. FAROOQ SAID IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED THERE AND IT MAKES SENSE TO
REFER IT TO THAT. I SEE THE HOUSING CO CHAIR NODDING HER HEAD.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROLL CALL?
>> REFERRING TO THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. (ROLL CALL).
>> I'D LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE ASK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
THAT IS RELATIVELY EASY. WE CAN ALL CALCULATE THE PER UNIT COST. IT
WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS DONE IN THE CHART FORM AS WELL AS ANY
PARTICULAR THIS WOULDN'T BE ON ALL PROJECTS. A FEW PROJECTS THAT
ARE VERY HIGH, THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT. I THINK A FOOTNOTE
WOULD HELP UNDERSTANDING THAT. ONE PROJECTS IS $900,000 A UNIT.
FOR OUR EDUCATION, WHY IS THAT? THAT SEEMS TO BE AN EXTREME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK IF IT IS A LATE ORDER, WE HAVE TO SUSPEND
THE RULES TO BRING IT FORWARD OR IF YOU MAYBE WANT, YOU CAN WRITE
UP THAT QUESTION, SEND IT TO THE CLERK THERE'S ANOTHER LATE ORDER
TO DISCUSS. WE CAN DO IT AT THAT POINT.
>> I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER WITH ME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MICHAEL CAN COME OVER AND HELP. WE CAN DO
THAT. WE CAN MOVE ON WITH THE CITY MANAGER AGENDA. WE ARE
MOVING TO 10. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 10).
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND TRAFFIC AND PARKING FOR GETTING THIS INFORMATION
BACK TO THE COUNCIL SO QUICKLY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT BIKING AND PEDESTRIAN COLLISIONS HERE IN THE CHAMBER AND IN
THE COMMUNITY AND LOOKING AT THEM BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO
WITHIN THE SAME WEEK. WE FELT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT
WHETHER OR NOT THIS INTERSECTION NEEDED SOME SAFETY IMPLEMENTS.
IT LOOKS LIKE BOTH INSTANCES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE
DRIVER ONE THAT HIT THE REAR WHEEL OF A CYCLE BICYCLE. AND THE
OTHER CAR ROLLING INTO A STROLLER. THIS QUESTION MAY BE FOR THE
POLICE COMMISSIONER OR MR. BARR, IT SEEMS LIKE THE INCREASE SIGNAGE
IS THE ANSWER THAT WAS COME UP WITH BY TRAFFIC AND PARKING AND


PAGE 36

May 24, 2021

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. DO WE THINK INCREASE SIGNAGE WILL INCREASE
ATTENTIVENESS AT THE INTERSECTION?
>> I THINK INCREASE SIGNAGE ALONG WITH INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE
WOULD BE HELPFUL. IF WE SEE VIOLATION, TAKING ACTION AS NECESSARY.
JUST REALLY CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS INTERSECTION IS SOMETHING THAT
WAS HELPFUL. AND WE ARE DIRECTING OUR OFFICERS TO SPEND TIME UP
THERE. I THINK THE INCREASE SIGNAGE ALONG WITH INCREASE
ENFORCEMENT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
>> THANK YOU. TOP COMMISSIONER ELOW, WHEN DO YOU THINK THE
SIGNAGE IS PLAN TO BE POSTED?
>> IN THE REPORT IT SAYS BY THE END OF NOVEMBER.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: OKAY. THANK YOU. I THINK ANYONE WHO HAS
KIDS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, ANYONE WHO HAD KIDS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL,
KNOWS HOW CRITICAL THIS INTERSECTION IS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ALWAYS PAYING THE MOST ATTENTION.
INATTENTIVE DRIVING AND INATTENTIVE TEENAGERS TRYING TO GET TO AND
FROM SCHOOL, HAVING INCREASED SIGNAGE AND PRESENCE WILL BE
HELPFUL. AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR GETTING THIS BACK TO US IN A TIMELY
MANNER. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I KNOW WE DISCUSS THIS ALL
THE TIME. ANY POSSIBILITY OR UTILITY TO HAVING RAISED CROSSWALKS OR
SOMEHOW PUTTING IN PLACE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD
FURTHER ALERT THE DRIVERS TO SLOW DOWN.
>> JOE BARR: ON CAMBRIDGE STREET, WE HAVE IN ADDITION TO SIGNAGE,
WE HAVE CURB EXTENSIONS, WITH THE EXTENDED BIKE LANES WHICH DID A
DESCENT JOB OF NARROWING THE STREET AND SLOWING IT DOWN. SO, WE
COULD LOOK IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE PHYSICAL WE CAN DO. IT WOULD
BE LONGER TIME FRAME TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NOT
ANY CONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR THAT AREA.
IN TERMS OF THE INCIDENT IN THE CROSSWALK, I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A
WHOLE LOT ELSE PHYSICALLY WE CAN DO. OTHER THAN THE SIGNS WE HAVE
RECOMMENDED. WE CAN LOOK AT THIS IN A LONGER TIME FRAME TO SEE IF
THERE IS ANYTHING THAT COULD BE MORE BUILT OUT. WE WANT TO MAKE
SURE WE GOT BACK TO THE COUNCIL QUICKLY GIVEN THE ORIGINAL
LANGUAGE IN THE ORDER.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER.
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. I OBSERVED A LOT OF
INCREASED TRAFFIC AND SEEMING INCREASED AGGRESSIVENESS AMONG
DRIVERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS ABOUT. IT IS DEFINITELY
CONCERNING. WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO
ENSURE SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M CURIOUS, HOW DO WE


PAGE 37

May 24, 2021

COLLECT CRASH DATA? PRIMARILY THROUGH MASSDOT? DIRECTLY
THROUGH YOU? SELF REPORTED? I'M CURIOUS. IT WOULD BE REALLY
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC SAFETY,
WHETHER PEDESTRIAN OR CYCLISTS OR MOTORISTS. WE WANT GOOD
BEHAVIOR FROM ALL. I'M CURIOUS HOW DO WE COLLECT THAT DATA. WE
ALL KNOW THAT I ASSUME WE ALL KNOW, IF THERE IS A CRASH, A CRASH
REPORT IS MANDATORY TO BE SENT TO MASSDOT. HOW DO YOU GET THAT
DATA AND DISAGGREGATE IT. A NUMBER OF SENIORS I HAVE SPOKEN TO,
RECENTLY AS THE FIRST WEDNESDAY OF DECEMBER MENTIONED A COUPLE
OF INCIDENTS WHERE SENIORS WERE HIT BY A CYCLIST. I'M CURIOUS, IF YOU
ARE A PEDESTRIAN HIT BY A CYCLIST, WHERE IS THAT REPORTED. MASSDOT
WOULDN'T PICK THAT UP BECAUSE THE CRASH REPORT IS NOT REQUIRED.
COULD EITHER YOU, COMMISSIONER, OR THE CITY MANAGER, EXPLAIN TO US
HOW WE DO THAT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS... IF WE CAN ANSWER THIS
BRIEFLY. IT IS A BIT BROAD. I RECOMMEND COMING BACK. WE DO HAVE A
LOT TO GO THROUGH FOR THE AGENDA.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU FOR THAT EDIFICATION. I WANT TO
HAVE A BALANCE DISCUSSION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. I'M
VERY AWARE AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON FELTON STREET.
I'M GETTING A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW ONE SIDED THE
CONVERSATION SEEMS TO BE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT. IT IS BEYOND THE
SCOPE A LITTLE BIT OF THE REPORT. I'LL LET YOU SPEAK, COMMISSIONER. IF
THERE IS NOT SPECIFIC TO THIS CRASH AND THE REPORT, I THINK WE CAN GET
A FULLER
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WILL REDEFINE IT. WITH THIS CRASH, HAD IT
BEEN WITH THE PEDESTRIAN, HOW WOULD WE GET THE DATA?
>> WE HAVE A LIST OF CRASHES INVOLVING BIKES, MOTOR VEHICLES, AND
PEDESTRIANS. EVERYTHING THAT REPORTED IN THE CITY, THROUGH
SEPTEMBER 2021 ON THE CITY'S OPEN DATA SITE. THAT'S WHERE IT IS ALL
UP TO DATE CRASHES THAT ARE REPORTED IN THE CITY.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: MY LAST FOLLOW UP. HOW DOES THE DATA GET
TO YOU? SELF REPORTING?
>> I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON HOW WE GET THAT DATA. IT IS IN THE
PORTAL.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WILL AMOUNT YOUR ANSWER. I YIELD.

#10 placed on file

PAGE 38

May 24, 2021

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO THE CITY MANAGER
AND PATRICK AND LEE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS LENGTHY REPORT. I
KNOW WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE AND YOU HAVE
WORKED HARD. I HAVE QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY ON THE TIMELINE AND
IMPLEMENTATION THAT WERE IN THE REPORT. THE DEMONSTRATION PILOT
THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING, MANNING APARTMENTS, NEWTOWN
COURT, ET CETERA, BEING A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TO DELIVER
BROADBAND INTERNET. IT SAYS THAT MARCH 2022 IS THE IMPLEMENTATION
DATE. THAT IS FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW. I'M HOPING THAT IS A SUPER
REALISTIC IMPLEMENTATION DATE. HOW ARE WE FEELING ABOUT THAT?
>> AT THE MOMENT, THE TIMELINE IS DRIVEN IN PART BY CHA RESOURCES
AND OTHER FACTORS. THAT'S WHY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY. I SHOULD ALSO
MENTION THAT THERE IS A PRETTY BIG PROJECT UNDERWAY AT CHA FOR ALL
THE PROPERTIES. DUE TO ANOTHER RFP. THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF A
MASSIVE PROJECT WITH THE INTERNET PROVIDER, STARY, THAT'S A MAJOR
STET UP FOR EVERY CHA RESIDENT. 200 MEGABITS SYMMETRICAL. WE ARE
LOOKING BEYOND THAT. THAT'S WHY WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. BETWEEN CHA RESOURCES AND THOSE KINDS OF
CONSTRAINTS, THAT'S WHY IT IS CHALLENGING TO MOVE FASTER. FRANKLY,
IT STILL INVOLVES SOME TECHNICAL DECISIONS TO BE MADE ABOUT NOT
ONLY THE FIBER DESIGN HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE PROPERTIES, BUT IT
INVOLVES WHAT ISP WILL BE INVOLVED TO DELIVER THE SERVICE AND A
NUMBER OF FACTORS YET TO BE DETERMINED.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT'S WHY I FELT LIKE MARCH 22, GIVEN THAT
WASHINGTON ELMS, WE'RE NOT SURE HOW WE'LL DELIVER THAT FIBER IT
SEEM THE LIKE WE HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING, LIKE MANNING
AND NEWTOWN COURT HAVE AN INSIDE CAPABILITY. I WOULD LOVE FOR IT
TO BE MARCH 2022. I WANT TO FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT DATE OF
IMPLEMENTATION FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE LOCATIONS. YES?
>> IT IS NOT A CERTAINTY. I WILL SAY THAT IT IS A DIFFICULT BALANCE FOR
US WITH DIGITAL EQUITY AND BROADBAND WHERE WE TRY TO MAINTAIN
AGGRESSIVE TIME LINES TO GET THE STAKEHOLDERS ON BOARD AND DO
WHAT WE CAN. IT IS NOT A CERTAINTY. FOR THAT MATTER, I HOPE WE
CONVEY THIS AS BEST WE COULD. IT IS NOT CERTAIN WHICH OF THE
PROPERTIES WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE WITH MIT AND OTHERS TO
DETERMINE FIBER ACCESS POINTS. I THINK A LOT IS REFLECTED IN THE CTC
REPORT. SOME ISN'T. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION. WE'RE STILL
HOPEFUL THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE QUICKLY, AT LEAST IN ONE OF
THE PROPERTIES. I HAVE TO CONQUER WITH THE COUNCIL THAT IT IS
CHALLENGING AND AGGRESSIVE. IT IS NOT CONCERN.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THE REPORT ALSO MENTIONS CITY
AND CHA TRAINING PILOT PROGRAM. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT
DEPARTMENT IS BEING ENVISIONED TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS? I THINK WE
TALKED ABOUT SOMEONE AT SOMEONE AT THE DEPARTMENT AND WHAT


PAGE 39

May 24, 2021

DOES THE STAFFING CAPABILITY LOOK LIKE?
>> YES. JAY LESLIE, AND OTHERS, MET WITH THE NONPROFIT TECH GOES
HOME TO OUTLINE A PILOT PROJECT. IT IS YET TO BE DETERMINED WHAT
CITY FOLKS COULD BE INVOLVE. IT IS TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL. IT IS
DESIGNED TO BE A PILOT TO INFORM FUTURE PROJECTS MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN UTILIZE YOUTH IN THE CITY, OTHERS
ACROSS THE CITY, THE TECH GOES HOME MODEL IS VERY MUCH ABOUT
BRINGING UP RESOURCES, EXTENDING SKILLS TO FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY
AND OTHERS. THAT'S THE PURPOSE. IT IS NOT THAT FAR ALONG AS TO HAVE
IDENTIFIED EVERYONE WHO IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN IT.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THAT BRINGS ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION, WHICH
IS THE EXPANDED DEVICE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM STARTING IN APRIL. YOU
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THIS WAS THE TRAINING PILOT
PROGRAM COULD BE FOR THE YOUTH IN THE CITY. I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN
READING THE Tilson REPORT AROUND THE DIGITAL EQUITY PILOT IN
NEWTOWN COURT. IT USED REFURBISHED DESKTOP COMPUTERS. AND
TWO, THEY WERE USED AS "IT" SUPPORT. I WAS SURPRISED. I HOPE THIS
EXPANDED DEVICE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM AND WHAT YOU ENVISION
DOESN'T SHORT CHANGE SOME OF THE GOALS THAT WE ALL HAVE AND
SOME OF THE RESOURCES I THINK WE HAVE TO DEDICATE TOWARDS THIS
REALLY IMPORTANT DIGITAL EQUITY PROJECT HERE IN THE CITY.
WHAT DOES AN EXPANDED DEVICE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM LOOK LIKE
STARTING IN APRIL 2022. ARE WE PROVIDING COMPUTERS? REFURBISHED
AND ARE WE HIRING A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS TO SUPPORT THIS
PROGRAM?
>> I'D LIKE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SKILLS AND SUPPORT. THAT'S ONE LEG
OF THE STOOL AND THE DEVICES. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF DEVICES. I
THINK AS A MORE RECENT PRECEDENT, CHROMEBOOKS NEW ONES,
MODERN, INTERNET CAPABLE DEVICES. I WILL SAY IT DOES DEPEND ON THE
USE. IT MAY BE THAT THEY ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR SOME. THEY KIND OF
REFLECT AND I THINK THIS IS TRUE IN MANY PROGRAMS, CAPABLE,
EQUITABLE, PORTABLE DEVICE. THAT WOULD BE THE STARTING POINT.
WE DO DISTRIBUTE CHROMEBOOKS AT THE MOMENT THROUGH THE LIBRARY
AND SCHOOL. EXPANDING WOULD BUILD UPON THAT. IN TERMS OF
FUNDING, WE LOOK AT A VARIETY OF RESOURCES OUTSIDE OF CITY FUNDS,
WHICH MAY BE USED, INCLUDING PRIVATE SUPPORT AND DONATIONS. WE
HAVE SOME CORPORATE SUPPORTERS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN HELPING
WITH THIS PROGRAM IN GENERAL AND DEVICES, IN PARTICULAR.
AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR DIGITAL EQUITY
WORK. THIS IS NOT WE WOULD HAVE PUT MORE INFORMATION IN HERE IF
IT WAS FULLY DEFINED. HOW THAT IS ROLLED OUT AND WHAT WAY IS NOT
FULLY DEFINED YET.
TO GET TO THE SECOND DIMENSION OF DIGITAL EQUITY AND THE SKILLS AND
SUPPORT, THAT'S TRICKIER ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM TO DELIVER WELL. AND
I WON'T GET INTO IT UNLESS COUNCILLORS WANT TO. IT IS REFLECTED IN

PAGE 40

May 24, 2021

THE REPORT. A LOT OF WORK DONE TO DATE IS HOW DO YOU STAND UP
MULTIPLE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS TO BEST MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY
ARE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEIR NEEDS AT THE RIGHT TIME.
LOOKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE RESEARCH WE DID OVER THE SUMMER,
IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU NEED TO BALANCE A CENTRALIZED APPROACH WITH
DECENTRALIZE UTILIZING EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STANDING UP NEW
PROGRAM WITH EXISTING NONPROFITS AS WELL AS CITY ROLES, SCHOOL THE,
LIBRARIES, CHA, AND SO ON. IT IS A CHALLENGING PROBLEM TO SOLVE. IT IS
AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS AS FAR AS THE TECH SUPPORT THAT
PEOPLE NEED AT HOME, THE SKILLS THEY WANT TO ACQUIRE THROUGH
CLASSES AND OTHER MEANS, IT IS A CENTRAL CHALLENGE TO OUR DIGITAL
EQUITY PROGRAM.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: IT IS AN EXCITING AND OVERDUE OPPORTUNITY. I
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T SHORT CHANGE THIS CRITICAL GOAL. I WAS
VERY SURPRISED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THE REPORT
FROM THE PREVIOUS DIGITAL EQUITY PILOT PROJECT. I'M HOPING WE DON'T
END UP IN THE SAME PLACE AFTER THIS ONE. I WILL CALL OUT WE HAD A
FORUM WITH SENIORS DURING THE ELECTION AND ONE THING THEY ASKED
FOR WAS TABLETS. FOR THEM, A CHROMEBOOK OR DESKTOP WILL NOT
WORK. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH TABLETS. IF WE MANNING
APARTMENTS AND DEVICES THERE, TABLETS MAY BE SOMETHING TO REALLY
CONSIDER. DEPENDING ON THE QUESTIONS FROM THE BODY AND THE
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS WANT AND MATERIALS,
THERE MAY BE A DESIRE TO REFER THIS TO A COMMITTEE FOR A FULLER
DISCUSSION WITH MORE OF THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU DIDN'T PUT IN
THE REPORT. I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS, MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE
SOME, COMMUNITY MAY HAVE SOMEONE. I WILL YIELD BACK. THAT MIGHT
BE ON THE TABLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THIS REPORT AND
GLAD TO SEE WE MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I AGREE
WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT THIS DESERVES FURTHER DISCUSSION IN
COMMITTEE, MOST LIKELY. I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS NOW TO
START WITH.
I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE REFERENCE TO THE POTENTIAL OF USING EXISTING
FIBER IN THE MANNING APARTMENTS. AND I IMAGINE YOU RECALL WE HAD
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT, I THINK, FOUR YEARS AGO. THE REPORT LEFT IT
UNCLEAR WHETHER IT WAS A POSSIBILITY. I'M WONDERING IF WE HAVE ANY
NEW INFORMATION SINCE THIS REPORT IS THIS DATA IS FROM JUNE THIS
YEAR. DO WE KNOW IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF USING FIBER IN THE
MANNING APARTMENTS?
>> THE INTENT OF THE APPOINTMENT PROJECT IS INDEED TO USE FIBER.
WHAT IS UNDERWAY CURRENTLY IS HIGH SPEED WIRELESS. THE INTENT OF
OUR PILOT PARTNERSHIP WITH CHA IS TO UTILIZE FIBER.


PAGE 41

May 24, 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. IT IS IN THE REPORT, IT NEEDS TO
BE VERIFIED WHETHER THERE WAS CITY FIBER THAT COULD BE ACCESSED
FROM THE MANNING APARTMENTS BASEMENT?
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CITY FIBER. MIT, IT IS ANOTHER OPTION, BUT
WE'RE CONFIDENT WE'LL HAVE A WAY THAT IS NOT AN OBSTACLE, WE DON'T
THINK.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THAT SOUNDS GOOD. YOU HAVE A NUMBER
OF OPTIONS THERE. NEXT QUESTION, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THIS TO BE A
PILOT OR A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, IN PARTICULAR, VICE MAYOR
MALLON BROUGHT UP GOOD QUESTIONS AROUND TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND
DEVICES, WHICH HAVE BEEN HANG UPS IN THE PAST. AS YOU MENTIONED,
THE ISP, SERVICE PROVIDER, STILL TBD. WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT WE'RE
DOING THIS AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT BECAUSE IF AND WHEN WE
RESOLVE THE QUESTIONS, DOES IT MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO END THE
PROGRAM AT SOME POINT? HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THAT?
>> SURE. THERE ARE A FEW REASONS WHY THAT HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A
PILOT. ONE, INDEED TO LEARN WHAT IS AND ISN'T EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF
SUPPORT. AND PROVIDING RESIDENTS WITH THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF
DEVICES, SKILLS, AND SO ON. WE ALSO HAVE MULTIPLE MOVING PART THE
AT THE MOMENT. I MEAN THAT AND IT IS A GOOD THING. IN OTHER WORDS,
THERE'S THE STARRY PROJECT GOING ON WITH CHA AND THE CITY'S
MUNICIPAL BROADBAND STUDY. I THINK IN SOME SITUATIONS, PEOPLE
WOULD WAIT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THE
PILOT. WE'RE SUGGESTING BETTER TO WORK IN PARALLEL. HAVE SOME
LOCATIONS WHERE WE CAN WORK THE KINKS OUT AND SEE WHAT IS AND
ISN'T EFFECTIVE. THAT WILL INFORM A LARGER EFFORT THAT IS NOT YET
FULLY DEFINED. IN PART, THE MUNICIPAL BROADBAND STUDY IS AIMED TO
DETERMINE HOW DO WE GET FAST CONNECTIVITY EVERYWHERE IN
CAMBRIDGE WITH A PRIORITY ON THE LEAST SERVED CURRENTLY.
VERY MUCH EXPECT TO BE LOOKING TO EXPAND IT, BUT WE DO NOT WANT
TO WAIT IN ORDER TO START GETTING TO WORK AT SOME OF THE CHA
PROPERTIES.
>> I THINK THE OTHER ADVANTAGE OF LOOKING AT A DEMONSTRATION
PROJECT, VICE MAYOR MALLON MENTIONED AN INITIATIVE THAT TOOK
PLACE, I BELIEVE, IT WAS IN THE 1990S. THIS IS ONE IN THE Tilson REPORT
FROM A WHILE AGO WITH THE REFURBISHED DEVICES. I THINK WHEN THEY
DID THE WIRELESS AT WASHINGTON ELM AND NEWTOWN COURT. REALLY
LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND. WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW
SYSTEM, YOU PROVIDE A SERVICE. ARE PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT.
WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE DOING WORK LEG AND THE BARRIERS. SO WHEN WE
APPLY TO A LARGER SCALE, IT IS WELL INFORMED RATHER THAN BUILDING
SOMETHING AT FIRST AND THEN WISH I HAD KNOW THESE THINGS. THIS
PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL INFORM FUTURE ENDEAVORS TO
SEE WHAT WORKS WELL, WHAT DOESN'T, AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN
AND HAPPENED AND HOW WE CAN RECONCILE THOSE.

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: POINT OF INFORMATION. THE REPORT I REFER TO
IS IN 2006 AND 2007.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THAT ALL MAKES SENSE. PART
OF THE CONCERN IS WHAT HAPPENS. WE HAD THESE PROGRAMS IN THE
PAST AS BEING POINTED OUT AND NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL. IT LEADS TO
PEOPLE HANGING. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT EXPERIMENTING
ON PEOPLE INSTEAD OF PROVIDING THEM WITH USEABLE SERVICES. I'M JUST
CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE STRIKE THAT BALANCE.
>> I THINK ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WE HAVE MADE IS TO LOOK AT HOW
DO YOU REALLY BUILD A WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE OUT FOR THE
COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE SERVING. THE WORK THAT Tilson DID WASN'T
LOOKING AT HOW TO PUT A BAND AID APPROACH TOGETHER. HOW TO
BUILD A ROBUST FIBER NETWORK THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE BUILDINGS. THE
ISP MAY CHANGE, YOU HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS IMPLEMENTED. IT IS
REALLY BUILDING HIGH QUALITY INTERNET SERVICE FROM AN
INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE THAT WILL BE THERE AND BE ABLE TO SERVE
THE RESIDENTS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE ANYBODY LIVES, SHOULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE YOU CAN PUT IN. THAT'S
WHAT Tilson HAS DONE AND TRIED TO APPROACH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ARE YOU ALMOST WRAPPED UP?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. CONVENING A
DIGITAL AND EQUITY COALITION TO GUIDE THE IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS.
ANY UPDATE ON WHEN WE EXPECT THAT TO BE UP AND RUNNING? I THINK
THAT WOULD HELP GUIDE THE EFFORTS?
>> I'LL LET PATRICK ANSWER. I WANT TO CORRECT. I'M SORRY, I HAD Tilson,
IT WAS CTC THAT DID THE REPORT. EXCUSE ME FOR SAYING Tilson A
MOMENT AGO.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIMELINE, WE HAVE SOME INDICATIVE DATES. WE
ARE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH THAT DIGITAL EQUITY COALITION BY MARCH.
BUT IN JANUARY WE LOOK TO HAVE A DIGITAL EQUITY NONPROFIT
WORKSHOP. THOSE ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING
INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS WITH VARIOUS NONPROFITS. THIS IS TO HAVE
A MORE STRUCTURED, COORDINATED, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND
THOSE ARE THE STEPS WE ARE TAKING THERE. AND YES, LEE REMINDED ME,
IN CASE THIS IS PART OF WHAT IS BEING ASKED ABOUT, WE HAD NUMEROUS
MEETINGS INTERNALLY ACROSS CITY DEPARTMENTS IN PART PREPARING FOR
THAT OUTREACH BEYOND CITY ORGANIZATIONS, SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES,
HUMAN SERVICES, CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE. TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY THE
SERVICES WE ARE PROVIDING, BUT HOW THEY INTERACT WITH THE VARIOUS
NONPROFITS IN THE CITY SO WE CAN DO THAT OUTREACH IN A PREPARED
WAY AND MAKE REAL PROPOSALS THAT WE CAN IRON OUT WITH EVERYBODY
INVOLVED. THAT IS GOING TO BE, I THINK, KEY TO THE SUCCESS IS HOW DO
WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS COMMON GOALS IN THE EFFORT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE, I SEEM TO HAVE


PAGE 43

May 24, 2021

VIDEO DIFFICULTIES. LUCKILY THE AUDIO WORKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO PROBLEM. WE WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WAS GOING TO OFFER THERE
COULD BE A
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WAS HAVING WE CAN POSSIBLY HAVE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WAS SAYING THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE A
MEETING AT THE CIVIC UNITY MEETING ALTHOUGH, IT MAY NOT BE
NEEDED. CAN I OFFER THAT, IF I CAN TALK TO THE TWO OF YOU IF THERE IS
SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE TALKED ABOUT AFTER WE TALKED ABOUT IT
HERE. IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CITY MANAGER
AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS REPORT. AS COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS SAID, CIVIC UNITY IS ONE WAY TO DISCUSS DIGITAL EQUITY AND
MAYBE A JOINT COMMITTEE, THIS GOES OVER A NUMBER OF AREAS THAT
BOTH COMMITTEES OR ANY OTHER COMMITTEE AS VICE MAYOR MALLON
SUGGESTED TO DIG IN DEEPER.
I WONDERED ABOUT THIS. THE SLIDE DECK PRESENTATION, BEST PRACTICES
OR CASE STUDIES, DID I MISS THE MEETING ON THAT. IT SAYS IT WAS
PRESENTED TO A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDER. DID I NOT GET TO THE COUNCIL
MEETING ON THAT?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN, THOSE WERE STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAD BEEN
INVOLVED LEADING UP TO IT. THAT WAS LIBRARIES, SCHOOLS, CITY STAFF,
THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT TO INFORM THE WPI WORK OVER THE
SUMMER. WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE YOU THERE, I'M SORRY WE
DIDN'T DO THAT FURTHER LEVEL OF OUTREACH.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY.
>> PART OF THE REASON FOR INCLUDING IT IN THE REPORT IS TO MAKE YOU
AWARE IF IT IS SOMETHING YOU WANT TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION ON,
WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT JUST AS OUR CONSULTANTS THAT DID THE
REPORT, CTC IS HAPPY TO COME AND SPEAK AND FOR US TO HAVE A
BROADER DISCUSSION.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WAS INTRIGUED. THIS DID HAVE A
NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS FROM CITIES. AND I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HOW
THE CITIES ARE PICKED, THE FIVE OR SIX MENTIONED, ALL ARE FOUR TIMES
THE SIZE OF CAMBRIDGE AND NONE CLOSER TO US. THERE ARE DIFFERENT
CHALLENGES INVOLVED. AND I'M CURIOUS NEXT CENTURY CITIES, YOU


PAGE 44

May 24, 2021

OUTREACH TO THEM AND USE THEM IN THIS WORK OVER THE LAST YEAR AS
WE MOVED TOWARD DIGITAL EQUITY AND THE MUNICIPAL BROADBAND?
WHAT ROLE OF THAT ORGANIZATION, SINCE WE JOINED THAT A YEAR AGO.
>> NEXT CENTURY CITY WAS AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH
WPI. THEY ARE A COMMON RESOURCE FOR MATERIALS AND RESEARCH. WE
HAVE NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED WITH THEM. IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION
ABOUT THE SIZE OF CITIES, YOU ARE RIGHT. A FEW REASONS LEADING TO
THE CITIES THAT ARE CHOSEN. ONE, WE LOOKED FOR PROGRAMS THAT
WERE UP AND RUNNING. FRANKLY, THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY UP AND
RUNNING IN CITIES OUR SIZE. AND WE LOOKED FOR CITIES THAT, IF NOT
DIDN'T MATCH US IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, WE ARE DIVERSE AND HAD
SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN BRIDGING DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN THEIR CITY,
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. AND FURTHERMORE, WHILE THERE ARE
SOMETIMES DIFFERENT SIZES, WE WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED AND THE
PROFESSOR AND STUDENT FROM WPI GUIDED THIS, WHICH IS WHAT SORT OF
INNOVATIVE APPROACHES ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE THAT ARE REALLY
PUSHING THE ENVELOPE IN THE WAYS THAT WE HOPE TO IN TERMS OF
BRINGING THE SERVICES TOGETHER TO ENSURE WE CAN REALLY REACH ALL
THE PEOPLE IN THE CITY. THOSE ARE SOME FACTORS THAT LED TO THE
SELECTION OF THE CITIES. YOU MIGHT NOTE, PURPOSEFULLY QUITE
DIFFERENT IN THAT SOME ARE VERY CENTRALIZED IN THEIR APPROACH, SOME
ARE DECENTRALIZED AND REFLECTED A NUMBER COMMUNITIES ARE WELL
SERVED BY NONPROFITS AND CITY GOVERNMENT.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. SEEMS IT WOULD BE GOOD TO DIG IN
AND HAVE A FULL MEETING DEDICATED TO IT. I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT AND
I ENCOURAGE US, WE DID JOIN NEXT CENTURY CITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE SET
UP AS NONPROFIT. THE CITY IS NOW A MEMBER. THEY HAVE RESOURCES,
NOT JUST MATERIALS AND DO WORK AROUND DIGITAL EQUITY. THERE'S A
NUMBER OF CITIES THAT ADDRESSED DIGITAL EQUITY PART OF THE WAY WE
THINK ABOUT IT, WITH MUNICIPAL BROADBAND AND A CITY OWNED
NETWORK. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD AND INCLUDE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AS AN EXAMPLE SINCE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO MAKE GOOD ON OUR
PROMISE OF REACHING EVERYBODY IN THE CITY. THE INTERNET IS A UTILITY
THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE ON THE LIFE JOURNEY
AND WHERE YOU ARE ON THE ECONOMIC SPECTRUM. IT IS IMPORTANT WE
PROVIDE IT. THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS, I'M HOPING WE DO
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE A MOTION...
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: SET UP A MEETING TO DO A DISCUSSION AND DO IT
AS WE MOVE FORWARD SINCE OVER THE NEXT YEAR, THERE'S MANY MORE
REPORTS ON DIGITAL EQUITY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I ECHO THE SUGGESTION TO HAVE A
FULLER CONVERSATION IN COMMITTEE. I HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION.
THE COST SECTION OF THE REPORT. SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE LIMITED TO
INTERNET ONLY AND NOT INCLUDE VOICE OR VIDEO PROJECTS. THINKING


PAGE 45

May 24, 2021

HOW MUCH OF THE INTERNET IS VOICE OR VIDEO. AND I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IS TALKING ABOUT PHONE SERVICE OR WHAT IS INCLUDED WHEN
IT TALKS ABOUT NOT INCLUDING VOICE OR VIDEO.
>> SPECIFICALLY, IT WILL NOT BE A CABLE SYSTEM. CABLE VIDEO WILL NOT
OBVIOUSLY THROUGH INTERNET STREAMING PEOPLE CAN ACCESS VIDEO
SERVICES. IT WOULDN'T BE A CABLE TELEVISION.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: GOT IT. I WANTED TO CLARIFY. I
YIELD.
>> I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. I REALLY DO WANT TO IF YOU DON'T
MIND, I WANT TO THANK PAT AND STEVE SMITH FROM THE SCHOOLS AND
JAY LESLIE WHO IS WORKING HARD. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND VICE
MAYOR MALLON WHO HAVE BEEN REALLY INVOLVED WITH US SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC AND HAVE BEEN STAYING ON TOP OF IT. I
REALLY APPRECIATE AND THANK COUNCILLOR NOLAN, WHO WORK CLOSELY
WITH US IN TERMS OF THE MUNICIPAL BROADBAND HAS BEEN A GOOD
BRIDGE BETWEEN US AND UPGRADE CAMBRIDGE. I WANT TO THANK
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, OVER THE PAST FEW
YEARS, HAVE BEEN ENGAGED WITH US. WE DO APPRECIATE THE INPUT AND
THE ADVICE AND THE PUSHING THAT WE GET FROM ALL OF YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK IT IS AN INTEREST OF ALL THE CITY COUNCILS.
IS THERE A MOTION TO REFER THIS TO A COMMITTEE. IF SO, WHICH
COMMITTEE?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I MOVE WE REFER THIS TO THE CIVIC UNITY
COMMITTEE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SIMMONS HAS A MOTION TO REFER THIS
TO THE CIVIC UNITY COMMITTEE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: WOULD COUNCILLOR SIMMONS BE OPEN TO
REFERRING IT JOINTLY TO THE CIVIC UNITY AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
LONG TERM PLANNING IT COVERS UP WITH IT.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: NEIGHBORHOOD AND LONG TERM PLANNING
CAN DO THE WHOLE THING IF YOU WOULD LIKE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT WITH YOU. ANYTHING YOU
DESIRE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL DO BOTH COMMITTEES AND HAVE A JOINT
MEETING. ON THE MOTION, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.

Motion for City Manager’s
Agenda Item #12 to refer to
Neighborhood and Long Term
Planning and Civic Unity

>> ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE CALENDAR. THREE ITEMS THAT WERE CHARTER
RIGHT. FIRST ONE. IT IS EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER.
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: THANK YOU. GLAD TO HAVE THE
DISCUSSION AND I'M SORRY TO NOT MAKE THE OPENING THIS PAST
WEEKEND. I SENT TO THE CLERK A POTENTIAL ADDITION TO THE POLICY


PAGE 46

May 24, 2021

ORDER THAT ASKS FOR THE UNIVERSAL DESIGN PLAYGROUND TO BE JOINTLY
NAMED, THE COMMUNITY LONG FELLOW SCHOOL, ET CETERA, WITH THAT
NAMING DID WE INCREASE THE DIVERSE OF THE PARK AND RECOGNIZE
SOMEONE WHO IS AN ADVOCATE FOR INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY, LIKE THE
UNIVERSAL DESIGN PLAYGROUND SEEKS TO DO. I INCLUDED IN ONE
WHEREAS. ONE SUGGESTION, FOR THE JOINT NAMING IN THE POLICY ORDER.
THE FIRST DEAFBLIND GRADUATE OF HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AND
RECOGNIZED BY THE WHITE HOUSE FOR HER WORK. AND AN ADVOCATE FOR
UNIVERSAL DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT BE A
PARTICULAR PERSON. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD KEEP IN PLACE ALL THE
ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IN THE POLICY ORDER. I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE CITY
MANAGER'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO CAMBRIDGE AND HIS WORK MAKING THIS
PLAYGROUND A REALITY AND HAPPY TO SEE THE PARK HAVE THE NAME. THE
AMENDMENTS ADD OR REQUEST WE USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE
DIVERSITY IN THE NAMING OF THE PARKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER PROPOSED AN
AMENDMENT. DISCUSSION? DISCUSSION FROM THE CITY COUNCIL ON THIS?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK MY SINCE MY
COLLEAGUE EXERCISED HIS CHARTER RIGHT LAST WEEK, I HAD TIME TO
REFLECT ON THIS ORDER. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE
>> CAN SHE SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: IT IS THE MASK. THAT'S ALL CAN I SAY. I WANT
TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE, NO I'M STARTING WRONG. SINCE MY
COLLEAGUE EXERCISED HIS CHARTER RIGHT LAST WEEK, I TIME TO REFLECT
ON THIS ORDER. I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE FOR
REACHING OUT TO ME LAST WEEK WITH THE PROPOSAL TO NAME THE
PLAYGROUND AFTER DISABILITY ACTIVIST AND ATTORNEY WITH CAMBRIDGE
TIES, WHO HE FELT MAY BE A MORE FITTING NAME FOR THE PLAYGROUND
OR NAMING IT AFTER BOTH THE YOUNG WOMAN AND AFTER THE CITY
MANAGER. AND WHILE I'M ON ONE HAND, I DO APPRECIATE THE
SUGGESTION, I MIGHT ADMIT THAT I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF
A WOMAN OR MINORITY BRINGING BROUGHT UP ALMOST AS AN
AFTERTHOUGHT IN THIS WAY.
IN SPEAKING WITH OTHER WOMEN IN CAMBRIDGE, PARTICULARLY BLACK
AND BROWN WOMEN, I HAVE LEARNED OTHER SHARES THIS SENTIMENT. I
DIDN'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THIS COUNCILLOR COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO
WHEELER, THIS WAS HIS INTENTION, BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THIS
WOMAN'S NAME WAS ADDED TO THE MIX AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE,
ALMOST CHEAPENS THE HONOR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH THIS
DISTINCTION. SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST DOESN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME. AND
ONE OF THE REMEDIES FOR THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE REALLY, IF THE
REASON FOR THIS AMENDMENT IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE REMEDIES FOR
THE PROBLEM, WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED PROCESS FOR THE CITY TO
FOLLOW IN NAMING OUR PLAYGROUNDS, PARKS, AND BUILDINGS...
I THINK THIS INSPIRED ME TO DEVELOP AND WRITE A LATE ORDER THAT I


PAGE 47

May 24, 2021

WILL PRESENT TO YOU THIS EVENING THAT WILL TOUCH UPON THAT
SUBJECT. I DO HAVE A BIT OF CONCERN THAT THIS LAST MINUTE PROPOSAL
OF USING THIS YOUNG LADY TO EITHER BLOCK OR BLUNT THE EFFORT TO
NAME THIS PLAYGROUND FOR LOUIS DEPASQUALE ALMOST SETS THIS
PROCESS UP AS A KIND OF CHESS GAME. CHOOSING THIS AS CHECKMATE,
NAMING SOMEONE THE COUNCILLOR MAY HAVE TAKEN ISSUE WITH. I'M
NOT SAYING THE COUNCILLOR'S INTENTION AND HOW IT MADE ME FEEL AND
HOW IT MADE OTHER BLACK WOMEN, BROWN WOMEN, AND OTHER
WOMEN OF COLOR FEEL. THERE'S A QUOTE THAT GOES PEOPLE MAY NOT
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAY, BUT THEY WILL REMEMBER HOW YOU MADE
THEM FEEL.
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE YOUNG LADY THAT THE COUNCILLOR HAS
SUGGESTED, WE POSSIBLY CO NAME THE PLAYGROUND AFTER, I DON'T WANT
TO DISCLOSE ALSO THE COUNCILLOR MENTIONED THE NAME I DON'T
WANT HER TO FEEL THIS HONOR SOMEHOW OR IS SOMETHING SHE MAY BE
GETTING PARTIALLY BECAUSE SHE IS BEING USED TO BLOCK A DIFFERENT
OUTCOME THAT SOMEONE WISHED TO PREVENT.
I'M SURE THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF MY COLLEAGUE. AS A WOMAN
AND A BLACK WOMAN, A PERSON OF COLOR, I'M CERTAINLY SENSITIVE TO
THE DYNAMICS. I WANT TO TAKE CARE THAT WE AS THE COUNCIL ARE
MINDFUL OF THEM. AS PEOPLE ARE AWARE, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN
WORKING TO BRING FORWARD THE FINAL REPORT ON MONUMENT,
MARKERS, AND MEMORIALS, APPOINTED BY THE CITY MANAGER LAST YEAR.
IT HAS HELPED ME TO CLARIFY MY THINKING ON THIS LARGER TOPIC.
LARGER TOPIC. CAMBRIDGE IS A PLACE WITH A RICH HISTORY AND IT
WASN'T UNTIL RECENTLY WE COMMEMORATE OTHER PEOPLE THAN WHITE
MEN. SOME WHITE MEN ARE FULLY DESERVING, SOME OF THEM WE ARE
LEARNING DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ELEVATED AND HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM.
AND WE AS A CITY NEED TO BE MORE DELIBERATE IN ACHIEVING A GREATER
BALANCE IN WHOM WE CHOOSE TO COMMEMORATE. AND STRIVING TO
ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE, I DON'T MEAN WE SHOULD OVERCORRECT BY
SAYING LET'S NO LONGER RECOGNIZE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITE
MEN FROM OUR HISTORY OR THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY CONTRIBUTING
SO MUCH TO OUR CITY. THIS IS ABOUT ACHIEVING BALANCE. AND THAT
MEANS FINDING APPROPRIATE WAYS TO CELEBRATE WOMEN. CELEBRATE
PEOPLE OF COLOR, CELEBRATE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, CELEBRATE
IMMIGRANTS AND YES THE WHITE MALES THAT CONTRIBUTE OR CONTRIBUTE
TO OUR GREAT COMMUNITY.
I SEE THAT MY COLLEAGUE BROUGHT IN A LATE SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT
ASKING FOR THE JOINT NAMING. OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE CITY MANAGER
AND WHAT HE HAS DONE AND IN RECOGNITION OF THIS THIS PLAYGROUND
WOULDN'T EXIST IF IT WERE NOT FOR HIS EFFORT AND RESPECT TO THE
INDIVIDUAL THAT MY COLLEAGUE SUGGESTED WE NAME THE PARK OFFER, I
SUGGEST WE FIND ANOTHER WAY TO HONOR AND HER CONTRIBUTIONS AND
THAT WE FIND WE VOTE THIS ORDER STRAIGHT UP OR DOWN ON NAMING


PAGE 48

May 24, 2021

THE PLAYGROUND FOR MR. LOUIS DEPASQUALE. WITH THAT, I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER? DID YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY BEFORE I MOVE ON TO COLLEAGUES?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I'M HAPPY TO LET MY COLLEAGUES
SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I TOO APPRECIATE THE CITY
MANAGER'S DEDICATION TO CAMBRIDGE AND THE MANY YEARS OF SERVICE
TO OUR COMMUNITY. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE CITY
MANAGER AND I THINK HE CERTAINLY IS DESERVING OF THIS LEVEL OF
HONOR, BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE IMPLICATIONS OF NAMING
PARKS, BUILDINGS OR THINGS AFTER A SITTING CITY MANAGE ER. I THINK
THAT CREATES A LOT OF EXPECTATION S AND IMPLICATIONS THAT I'M JUST
NOT COMFORTABLE WITH.
I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A REALLY
INTENTIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR NAMING PRACTICES AND HOW
WE PROCEED GOING FORWARD. I'M NOT IN SUPPORT OF NAMING THIS PARK
AFTER OUR CITY MANAGER RIGHT NOW GIVEN HE IS STILL ACTIVELY
PERFORMING BOTH DUTIES. I APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT. I
DIDN'T READ IT AS NECESSARILY ASKING TO BE NAMED AFTER THIS SPECIFIC
INDIVIDUAL. I READ IT MORE AS AN EXAMPLE OR A POSSIBILITY. SO, I HOPE IT
CAN BE PART OF OUR CONSIDERATION FOR HOW WE NAME THIS PARK AND
HOW WE PROCEED IN GENERAL GOING FORWARD WITH NAMING THESE
PUBLIC PLACES.
IT DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY TO ME THAT WE DECIDE ON A NAME RIGHT
NOW. WE CAN WAIT UNTIL THE CITY MANAGER IS RETIRED AND THEN NAME
IT AFTER HIM. I'M NOT CLEAR WHY WE ARE RUSHING TO NAME IT AFTER HIM
RIGHT NOW.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. COUPLE OF THINGS. I THINK PART
OF THE REASON THAT WE ARE THIS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD WHEN IT
WAS IS BECAUSE THE PARK WAS OPENING. WE WERE HAVING IF THE
CHARTER RIGHT WASN'T ISSUED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
DONE, TALKED ABOUT OR ACKNOWLEDGED AT THE BIG EVENT. LIKE
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER, I HAD TO MISS. I THINK THERE WERE
CONSIDERATION AND SOME TIMING ISSUES IN TERMS OF HOW THE
CALENDAR FELL.
IN TERMS OF NAMING SOMETHING AFTER SOMEONE WHO IS CURRENTLY
EMPLOYED OR ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN THE CITY, I DO THINK THAT IS
UNUSUAL. AGAIN, I THINK PART WAS THE WAY THE CALENDAR WAS PLAYING
OUT AND THIS PARK IS OPENING NOW. SO, THERE WAS A DESIRE TO DO THIS
NOW. IT IS ALSO I THINK IT IS A DEDICATION NOT JUST FOR THE SERVICE AS
CITY MANAGER BUT FOR HIS 50 PLUS YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY IN


PAGE 49

May 24, 2021

GENERAL. AND I THINK IT IS DESERVING. I DO AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER AROUND AND WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED POLICY
ORDERS AROUND LOOKING AT NOT JUST PARKS, BUT THE STREET NAMES
AND SCHOOLS. TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN GET MORE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY
IN NAME ING THOSE CITY PROPERTY. I THINK WE SHOULD.
THIS CONVERSATION KIND OF REMINDS ME OF WHEN WE GET THE CITY
MANAGER PUTS FORWARD SAYING HE IS GOING TO APPOINT JOE SMITH TO
THIS PLANNING BOARD OR COMMISSION. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE END UP
IN A DISCUSSION OF HOW THE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HAVE PROBLEMS
AND THEY ARE NOT DIVERSE AND THEY ARE NOT THIS AND THAT. THE
CONVERSATION IS TIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN WE TALK
ABOUT IT. THOSE ARE THE WRONG TIMES TO TALK ABOUT IT. THIS IS NOT
REALLY ABOUT MR. LOUIS DEPASQUALE. I HOPE WE CAN HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT A PROCESS FOR HOW WE REACH THE DECISIONS. I
HAVE ISSUES I RAISED AROUND THE STREET CORNER DEDICATIONS. THIS IS
NOT A CRITICISM OF THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE, BUT I
HAVE ASKED AT THE REQUESTS OF FOLKS FOR STREET CORNER TO BE NAMED
AFTER PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE WHO LIVED THEIR WHOLE LIFE HERE AND
MEANT A LOT TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY HAVEN'T LED A MASSIVE
MOVEMENT OR DONE ANYTHING THAT ALTER THE CITY OR CHANGE THE
WORLD, THEY DON'T GET THE CORNER NAMED AFTER THEM BECAUSE THEY
HAVEN'T MADE A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH CONTRIBUTION.
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR NAMING AND HOW
THIS PROCESS PLAYS OUT. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT ON THE BACK OF
THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE CITY MANAGER. I WILL VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH THE ORIGINAL PETITION. I'M A COSPONSOR. I THINK IT IS WELL
DESERVED. I THINK IT IS NICE TO DO THINGS. I DON'T AGREE WE SHOULD DO
THINGS AFTER PEOPLE ARE DEAD. I THINK IT IS NICE SOMETIMES TO
ACKNOWLEDGE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE ALIVE SO THEY CAN ENJOY THAT. I
THINK WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
COSPONSOR S ON THIS PROPOSAL TO NAME THE PLAYGROUND AFTER OUR
CITY MANAGER. I CONQUER WITH THE NOTION THAT IT IS ODD TO NAME
PLACES FOR CURRENT EMPLOYEES. I FELT THAT WAY 20 YEARS AGO WHEN
MAYBE LONGER, WHEN A CERTAIN AMENITY WAS NAMED AFTER SOMEONE
WAS WHO WAS STILL ACTIVE IN CITY GOVERNMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND,
THIS HAS BEEN THE PROCESS. THERE WAS A POLICY ORDER PUT FORWARD.
AND I THINK THE NOTION IN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS'S DRAFT PETITION
MAKES SENSE TO ME. THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES
EVERYTHING THAT COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER HAS BROUGHT UP
RIGHTFULLY SO. THIS SHOULD BE IN THE NEXT TERM OR THIS TERM,
STARTING IN JANUARY. NAMING OF THIS AMENITY HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND
HAS BEEN CELEBRATED AND I WILL CONTINUE WITH THAT INTENT. I DO
THINK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
COMBINE EFFORTS TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AND AFTER PEOPLE HAVE
RETIRED FROM THE CITY, NOT NECESSARILY LEFT THE EARTH, BUT AFTER THEY


PAGE 50

May 24, 2021

RETIRE IS VERY APPROPRIATE. I WILL GO ON RECORD THAT I NEVER WANT
ANYTHING NAMED AFTER ME. AND MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY
AND ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE TRULY DESERVE IT. THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES BRINGING FORTH
THE PROPOSALS. I VIEW THE SUBSTITUTE AS QUITE WONDERFUL AND QUITE
ADDITIVE, JUST LIKE WE NAMED A SCHOOL GRAMM AND PARKS. OFTEN
HAVING TWO PEOPLE IS FOR ME A WONDERFUL PARTNERSHIP. FOR ME,
NAMING A WONDERFUL PARK FOR A COUPLE OF PEOPLE, SEVERAL DIFFERENT
PEOPLE, WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE HONOR. AS FOR THE COMING OUT AND
SEEMING LIKE IT IS THROWN OUT THERE, I WAS SURPRISED TO KNOW THIS
WAS UNDER DISCUSSION AND ON THE AGENDA. MAY HAVE STEPPED ON THE
QUESTION FOR PROPOSING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
UNDER DISCUSSION FOR BEING NAMED. I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE HAVING
A CHANCE TO DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT. I VIEW IT AS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RANGE FOR PEOPLE AND I LOVE THE IDEA OF
SAYING LET'S THINK ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE WE MAY HONOR. AT THE
OPENING, SEVERAL OF US WERE THERE. IT WAS MOVING TO HEAR ABOUT
MEMBERS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND HOW MEANINGFUL IT WAS. THEY
HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES WORKING IN THE CITY ON BEHALF OF FOLKS WITH
DISABILITIES AND UNDERSTANDING THE WRENCHING BATTLE FOR
RECOGNITION AND FOR A PLACE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY COULD CALL HOME IN
OUR CITY. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF AND IT IS
REALLY WONDERFUL THAT THE CITY MANAGER IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT
MADE IT HAPPEN. IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO HONOR WITH SOMETHING.
FOR ME, IT IS AN EXTRA HONOR TO HAVE ANY NAME BE ASSOCIATED WITH
ANOTHER NAME OF A HERO WHO HAS DONE WONDERFUL THINGS FOR THE
CITY. PERSONALLY, I'M SURPRISED WE ARE NOT PROPOSING NAMING A
BASEBALL FIELD AFTER THE CITY MANAGER SINCE HE AND RENOWNED AND
UNBELIEVABLE IN THE DEDICATION TO GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF
YOUTH IN THE CITY WHO PLAYED BASEBALL AND HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE
ROLE MODEL FOR THAT AND THROUGHOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS AND THE
PRESSURES OF THE JOB. I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE ARE GOING WITH THIS. IF
THIS LATE POLICY ORDER WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MEAN WE
WON'T BE NAMING SOMETHING TONIGHT, WE'LL REFER IT AND HAVE THIS
BECOME THIS NAMING PROCESS BECOME PART OF THE DISCUSSION ON
EXPANDING THE PROCESS OF NAMING BUILDINGS AND STREETS AND
INCLUDE PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS, WHICH I'M IN FAVOR OF. AS NOTED, IF
THE OPENING HAS ALREADY HAPPENED, WAITING A FEW MORE MONTHS TO
DECIDE HOW WE'LL NAME IT, IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS PRUDENT
AND ALLOW US TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH
A PROCESS SO EVERYONE FEELS HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD. I THINK IT
WOULD BEHOOVE US TO DO THAT. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT IS ON THE TABLE. I
HAVE A QUESTION, THIS IS JUST THE ORDERS ARE, IT IS A REQUEST. WHO
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY DO THE NAMING? I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT
ON THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE SIDE SINCE WE WENT THROUGH IT A LOT.
DOES THE COUNCIL HAVE THAT? NOT JUST REQUESTS IF THIS PASSES, OUR


PAGE 51

May 24, 2021

WORD IS WHAT HAPPENS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S THE CASE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN, THAT LATE ORDER FROM
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS IS NOT BEFORE US. IT IS NOT BEFORE US. WE CAN'T
BRING IT BEFORE US WE CAN BRING IT FORWARD. THERE IS A MOTION TO
ACT ON. UP AND DOWN AROUND THE AMENDMENT. COUNCILLOR
SOBRINHO WHEELER, WE'LL GO TO HIM AND PROCEED WITH ROLL CALL.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: I WOULD ADD, FOR THIS PIECE,
ADDITION TO THE POLICY ORDER AND DOESN'T SUBSTITUTE OR REMOVE ANY
PIECE OF IT, NOT ABOUT THE CITY MANAGER, A CHANCE TO HONOR
SOMEONE IN ADDITION TO HIM. I THINK IT MAKES SENSE WE NAME PARKS
AFTER CITY MANAGER AND WE HAVE OTHER PIECES NAMED AFTER PREVIOUS
CITY MANAGER. THE POINT IS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE STAY MANAGER. CITY MANAGER. THIS GIVES US A
CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO BE
IN POSITION OF POWER AND MADE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS. SEE IF WE
CAN HAVE THE CONTRIBUTIONS RECOGNIZED AND IN DOING SO RECOGNIZE
RESIDENTS IN THE CITY WHO DON'T SEE THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN OUR
PARKS. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN PROCEED TO THE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF INFORMATION? RIGHT NOW WE ARE
JUST VOTING ON THE AMENDMENT. IF IT FAILS, WE VOTE ON THE MAIN
ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: UNLESS THERE'S MORE AMENDMENTS.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WAS GOING TO ASK TO PUT THE AMENDMENT
UP, WHICH IS NOW UP.
>> ON AMENDING POLICY ORDER WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT IS SUBMITTED
BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER:

Sobrinho-Wheeler to amend

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I CHARTER WROTE THIS LAST WEEK,
MANY POINTED OUT THIS AREA IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR MANY YEARS.
IT IS LONG OVERDUE THAT SOMETHING MOVES FORWARD. I'M NOT SURE
THIS POLICY ORDER IS THE CORRECT WAY TO ACHIEVE THE ZONING THAT WE
ARE LOOKING FOR. I WILL VOTE PRESENT ON THIS. ASKING THE RESIDENTS
AND CITY STAFF TO LOOK INTO THIS. IT SEEMS I VOTED AGAINST THE 3 4
MILLION MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY WENT. HOPEFULLY,
THE NEW COUNCIL COMING IN JANUARY WILL LOOK INTO THIS AND COME UP
WITH A PLAN THAT IS GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL THE DIFFERENT
PARTIES INVOLVED, ESPECIALLY TO THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE ADJACENT TO

THE AREA. I DON'T THINK THIS POLICY ORDER AS WRITTEN IS THE RIGHT WAY
TO PROCEED. I WILL VOTE PRESENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I HAD MY HAND UP FROM THE
PREVIOUS ROUND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. VICE MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EMAILS TO
THIS EFFECT AS WELL. I WANT TO CONFIRM WITH THE CLERK THE ONLY
ACTION THE CITY COUNCIL CAN TAKE, REFER TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
AND THE PLANNING BOARD. IS THAT CORRECT?
>> RIGHT NOW, IT IS A POLICY ORDER THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TO VOTE
TO BASICALLY ADOPT THIS INTO THE NEXT STAGE. LET ME BACK UP.
ZONING AMENDMENTS ARE GOVERNED BY 40 A. OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
GENERAL LAWS. THERE ARE CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO
SUBMIT ZONING PETITION. ONE ENTITY IS A CITY COUNCIL. A SINGLE CITY
COUNCILLOR DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT IT. WHAT IS HAPPENING
NOW, COUNCILLOR NOLAN HAS SUBMITTED A POLICY ORDER THAT THE CITY
COUNCIL THEN SUBMIT A ZONING AMENDMENT. THE COUNCIL COULD VOTE
UP OR DOWN ON THE POLICY ORDER. ONCE THE POLICY ORDER HAS BEEN
ADOPTED, IT IS THEN GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS WHERE IT HAS TO GO
TO THE PLANNING BOARD AND ORDINANCE COMMITTEE AND ON THE TIME
FRAMES WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH FROM 40 A.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT. WHEN I
ASKED THAT QUESTION LAST WEEK, IT WAS IN THE BOOK AND SAID REFER TO
ORDINANCE AND PLANNING BOARD. I THOUGHT. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
I WILL YIELD BACK. I HAVE OTHER COMMENTS TO MAKE, BUT I WANT TO
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING INTO US
HAD THE SAME UNDERSTANDING AS THE CLERK. WE COULD VOTE UP AND
DOWN. I THOUGHT IT WAS WE WOULD REFER TO ORDINANCE AND
PLANNING BOARD FOR FULLER DISCUSSION. I YIELD BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I WILL TALK ABOUT ENVISION FOR A MOMENT
WHICH LEAD TO THE STATE ALEWIFE IS IN. ENVISION POLICY ORDER THAT I
WROTE STATED PLANNING AND URBAN DESIGN. YOU CAN'T DO ZONING
WITHOUT URBAN DESIGN. YOU HAVE TO TEST DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES. THAT
HAS NEVER HAPPENED. A VERY BEAUTIFUL DRAWING WAS DONE OF WHAT
COULD HAPPEN. THAT'S NOT AN URBAN DESIGN PLAN, IT IS AN ILLUSTRATIVE
PLAN OF MAYBE. URBAN DESIGN PLAN GOES INTO STRATEGIES, GUIDELINES,
GETS INPUT FROM ALL BUILDS ON THE INPUT THAT IS WRITTEN BY ENVISION
BY TALKING TO NEIGHBORS AND LAND OWNERS. IT HAS A VISION OF WHAT
IT'S GOING TO BE. IT INCLUDES OPEN SPACE, WHICH EVERYBODY KNOWS IS
NECESSARY THERE. IT INCLUDES PUBLIC USES, WHICH WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
WE'RE GOING TO NEED AS MANY AS TWO MORE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN
THE CITY. WHERE ARE THEY GOING? THINGS LIKE THAT. IT INCLUDES A
MORE REFINED PLAN AND A STRATEGY OF HOW TO DO IT, HOW TO PAY FOR
IT, HOW TO LINK TO THE MBTA, ALL OF THOSE THINGS.


PAGE 54

May 24, 2021

WHAT WE HAVE DOESN'T DO ANY OF THAT. AND THAT'S WHY I WILL BE
VOTING FOR THIS. IT IS LONG OVERDUE. I WROTE A MEMO TWO OR THREE
YEARS AGO ON THIS OF WHAT WAS NECESSARY. AFTER WE SAW THE INITIAL
DRAWING. AND I SAID, IT DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE. I WILL BE VOTING
FOR THIS AND I KNOW IT IS THE RIGHT MOVE. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING
TO GET A REAL STUDY DONE OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE WORDS THAT
HAVE BEEN CREATED. THERE IS NO PLAN. IT IS WORDS. THEY CAN BE
INTERPRETER ED THOUSANDS OF WAYS. IT DOESN'T ALL HANG TOGETHER
AND VERY LITTLE PUBLIC AMENITY.
I WILL FINALLY SAY MINIMAL PARK SYSTEM WAS PROPOSED IN WORDS AND
IN THE ILLUSTRATIVE PLAN. THAT LAND HAS BEEN FOR SALE AND MAYBE
SOLD FOR SIX OR EIGHT MONTHS. THE CITY DIDN'T MOVE ON THAT. THERE IS
NO PLAN. THERE IS NO STRATEGIES. AND WE HAVE TO GET THAT TO DO THE
RIGHT ZONING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN. I WILL SAY THAT I
WANT TO THANK HER FOR SPONSORING THIS AND WE HEARD THIS IS ONE OF
THE LAST AREAS TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY UNDERDEVELOPED. IT IS A HUGE
POTENTIAL TO HAVE A REALLY SPECIAL MIXED USE STRICT WITH A FOCUS ON
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, OPEN SPACE, GOOD JOBS. IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT
TO PLAN AND SO WE DON'T REGRET ANYTHING LATER. I WANTED TO JUST
SAY THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR LEADING THIS.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, I KNOW YOU HAVE
WORKED HARD ON THIS AREA AND TRY TO ENSURE THE VISION FOR IT ARE
ENACTED, WHICH IS WHY YOU HELP COSPONSOR THIS ALONG WITH
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. I DON'T HAVE TO TALK LONG. VICE MAYOR
MALLON NOTED AND THE CLERK, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS REFERRING IT TO
ORDINANCE AND PLANNING. I THINK AS WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL FORCING US AND WHAT WE ARE
DOING, THIS IS A PLEA TO THE CITY TO SAY WE HAVE ASKED FOR 40 YEARS
FOR ZONING. WE WANT IT AND WE ARE SERIOUS AND REMIND PEOPLE,
WHEN THAT COMES THROUGH, THAT ZONING THAT WE ORDAIN, IT WILL BE
IN PLACE. AND ANYONE CAN THEN THE MORATORIUM IN HERE WILL NO
LONGER BE VALID. WE WILL HAVE ZONING IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THIS. I
WILL NOTE, AS NOTED IN THE LANGUAGE, THERE ARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
THAT ARE ENCODED IN THE REPORTS. OUR HOPE, I KNOW THAT THOSE
MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND I WHO SPONSORED
THIS, WE EXPECT AND ASSUME THE PLANS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE
DISCUSSION. I HOPE IT PASSES. I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE AND I KNOW
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS ORDINANCE. I'M HAPPY TO HOLD FURTHER
DISCUSSION UNTIL THAT HAPPENS. WHEREAS AND THIS LAYS OUT WHY IT IS
NEEDED. IN MY VIEW, LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE 1979 ALEWIFE PLAN AND
2019 ALEWIFE PLAN, LOOK REMARKABLY SIMILAR. YET, WE HAVEN'T
MANAGED TO PUT IN PLACE ZONING TO REALIZE THE VISION. I HAPPY WE DO
TONIGHT. WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND I WILL LOOK TO THE ORDINANCE
CO CHAIRS TO SPONSOR SOMETHING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. UNLESS THERE
ARE QUESTIONS, I MOVE ADOPTION. I WILL NOT DO THAT IF PEOPLE WANT


PAGE 55

May 24, 2021

TO TALK.
>> WHEN YOU SEE A PLAN, YOU THINK THAT IS THE ANSWER, THAT ISN'T THE
ANSWER. THESE PLANS ARE BOTH VERY WEAK. AND THEY ARE NOT URBAN
DESIGN PLANS. THEY ARE NOT STUDIES OF DENSITY AND HEIGHT AND OPEN
SPACE. THEY ARE PLACE HOLDERS. AND THEY ARE SIMILAR BECAUSE
ENVISION PRETTY MUCH DUPLICATED IN MANY PARTS WHAT WAS DONE BY
THE CITY, EVEN CITY WIDE IN THE SUSTAINABLE STUDY THEY DID IN THE '90S.
IT NEVER DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I'M NOT INCLUDING URBAN
DESIGN. I'M SAYING PLANNING. I THINK IT IS A GREAT START, BUT NOT THE
END. THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN. HITTING A WALL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SEEING NOBODY ELSE, WE CAN PROCEED ON
ADOPTION.
>> ON THE VOTE:
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: PRESENT.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: PRESENT.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MOTION PASSES, SEVEN IN FAVOR AND TWO ABSENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THIRD CHARTER RIGHT ITEM.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. IN REFERENCE TO THE CHARTER
RIGHT, I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE FOR INTRODUCING HER
ORDER, IT MENTIONS MANY RESIDENTS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE
REMOVAL OF THE 80 PARKING SPOTS ON MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. AND
THE PLAN DOESN'T DOESN'T MEET ANY HANDICAP PARKING SPACES SINCE
THEY ARE NOT DESIGNATED SPOTS. REDUCTION OF PARKING, RESIDENTS ARE
CONCERNED NO ACCESSIBLE SPOTS WILL BE ADDED. THE ORDER NOTES THAT
RESIDENTS WITH LIMITED MOBILITY WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCESS
SERVICES AND BUSINESSES ALONG THE STRETCH AND FOR SOME, USING A
CAR IS THE ONLY OPTION. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE COMMUNICATED THEIR
CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR LONG TERM VIABILITY WITH THE LOSS OF PARKING.
I'M PLEASED THAT ALL OF THESE ARE NOTED IN THE POLICY ORDER. I'M
PLEASED THE ORDER ASKED FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS.

CALENDAR ITEM # 2
ADOPTED AND REFERRED
TO PLANNING BOARD AND
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE
That Article 20.90- Alewife
Overlay Districts 1-6 of the
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance
be amended to insert a new
section entitled Section 20.94.3Temporarily prohibited uses
(Ordinance #2021-25).
CHARTER RIGHT
EXERCISED BY
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY IN
COUNCIL NOVEMBER 8,
2021

THE VERY LAST ORDERED SECTION STATES... THAT THE REQUEST OF THIS
REPORT DOES NOT IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT PLANNED
ON MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE BETWEEN DUDLEY AND ALEWIFE BROOK
PARKWAY SCHEDULED TO BEGIN THIS WEEK. FOR ME, THIS IS PROBLEMATIC.

PAGE 56

May 24, 2021

IF THE CITY DETERMINES THIS PLAN WAS HALF BAKED OR SERIOUS CONCERNS
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ADEQUATE
TIME TO REVISE THE PLAN AND ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR
EVERYBODY. I OFTEN SAY, SOMEHOW IN THIS DISCUSSION, WE ALL WANT TO
MAKE SURE ALL METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION ARE SAFE, WE HAVE TO
SOMEHOW GET TO WHAT I CALL IS THE UNHAPPY MEDIUM.
WITH THAT SAID, THIS SOLUTION DOESN'T GET US TO THE UNHAPPY
MEDIUM. IT GETS US TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF ONE SEGMENT. MY
TAKEAWAY, WE ARE SO COMMITTED TO THAT DEADLINE WE ARE WILLING TO
SACRIFICE GETTING IT DONE RIGHT. OTHER THING YOU HEARD ME SAID, YOU
CAN DO THE RIGHT THING THE WRONG WAY. AND IF MORE TIME MAY
ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIVE AND COME TO A SOLUTION THAT
CREATES A SAFER PATH FOR CYCLISTS AND ALLOWS SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE
VIABLE AND ALLOWS SENIORS AND THOSE WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS TO
GET AROUND THE AREA. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO LIGHT A FIRE AND
CREATE DEADLINES TO ENSURE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK IS DONE IS
IMPORTANT AND I AGREE THIS IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. I DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THE UNWILLINGNESS TO BUILD FLEXIBILITY INTO THE
PROCESS TO ALLOW US THE SPACE TO ENSURE WE GET IT RIGHT. WE HAVE
SEEN THAT AND NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, I CAN THINK OF CAMBRIDGE
STREET AND THE PHARMACY WHERE WE PROMISE THIS WAS PUT UP THIS
INFRASTRUCTURE. IT WILL BE TEMPORARY. COME BACK AND REVISIT IT. WE
NEVER REALLY DID IT IN A WAY THAT MADE THE BUSINESSES CLOSE TO BEING
WHOLE AGAIN. DOES THIS NOT SEEM LIKE A WISE WAY TO GOVERN. I WON'T
VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR NOLAN'S RAISING
OF THE ISSUES, I CANNOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF IT. NOWHERE IN THIS ORDER
DOES IT SUGGEST OR MAKE ROOM FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TIMELINE IN
AN EFFORT TO INCORPORATE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE ASKED FOR BY
THE FOLKS THAT YOU ARE GOING OUT TO TALK TO. AND WE HAVE SEEN IN
TOO MANY CASES THE OUTREACH IS WOEFULLY INEPT. YOU DON'T ADDRESS
THE ISSUES PROPERLY, I WON'T VOTE FOR THIS ORDER AND I WILL YIELD THE
FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS TOPIC AND ORDER?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. I VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE THE REMARKS AND I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN AND
CONFUSION. I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE HEAR THAT WE MY VIEW WE SHOULDN'T IGNORE THE PLEAS. WE
HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY AND IT WAS A RANGE OF PEOPLE. IT WAS
MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE WHO HAVE BUSINESSES HERE. SOME
ARE BOTH RESIDENTS AND I WANT US TO HAVE A STRONG STATEMENT TO
SAY WE HEAR AND YOU WE WANT AND ASK THE CITY TO DO WHAT THEY CAN.
IT IS ALSO TRUE, I DIDN'T SAY THIS SHOULD DELAY THINGS. I WAS ASSURED
BY TRAFFIC AND PARKING WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT IT, IF THEY PUT IN THE
BIKE LANES NOW, IT HAD TO DO WITH PAINT. IT IS INTERESTING THIS WEEK
AND THE DEADLINE MENTIONED IN THE BIKE ORDINANCE IS MAY 1ST OF NEXT
YEAR. THERE WAS QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE HAD TO DO IT THIS


PAGE 57

May 24, 2021

WEEK. THAT HAS GONE FORWARD. WHAT WE NEED TO SEND A STRONG
MESSAGE, JUST BECAUSE WE PUT IN A BIKE LANE DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE
TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF THE PARKING. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS. I KNOW
THERE'S REAL CONCERN ABOUT SAFETY RELATED TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
I URGE US TO DIG DEEP AND UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MEET THE
CONCERNS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR DEPLOYMENT OF VEHICLES
AND STILL MAINTAIN AND BRING BACK THE PARKING THAT IS SCHEDULED TO
BE ELIMINATED. IT IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME IF YOU INCLUDE ALL
ELEMENTS. THIS IS A PLEA TO SAY WE WE CARE ABOUT RESIDENTS AND
SMALL BUSINESSES, AND YET IT IS TRUE IN SOME OF THE INSTANCES THAT
PEOPLE HAVE FELT THEIR VOICE IS NOT LISTENED TO AND AS COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS NOTED, OUR OUTREACH, WE MAY HAVE DONE IT. PEOPLE ARE
SURPRISED, IT WASN'T EFFECTIVE. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DID OUTREACH, IF IT
WASN'T EFFECTIVE, DO IT AGAIN. AND GIVEN A GROUP OF CITIZENS WENT
ON THEIR OWN TIME AND GOT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO BE AWARE OF THIS
AND SIGN PETITIONS, HIRE THEM TO DO THE OUTREACH. LET THEM KNOW
WE'LL LOOK TO THEIR METHODS TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT STAGE IT WILL
COME. REMEMBER, WE HAD THE SAME SITUATION WHEN WE DID BRATTLE
SITUATION AND SAME SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE STREET. AND WILL NOW
HAVING IT IN UPPER MASS AVENUE. LET'S MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE IT
AGAIN. POP UP SECTIONS ARE MOVING US TO THAT AND I STAND BEHIND
THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE A NETWORK OF BIKE LANES AND THINK CAREFULLY
ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENSURE MEET THE NEEDS OF THE OTHER RESIDENTS
WHO DO NOT RELY ON BIKES AND WALKING. I HOPE WE PASS IT. I
APPRECIATE COMMENTS MADE BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I'M SAD SHE
CAN'T SUPPORT IT, AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR US TO PUSH US TO REMEMBER
THERE OTHER VOICES IN THE ROOM.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: I DON'T THINK I WILL BE VERY LONG. I WANT TO
SAY, FROM THE BEGINNING, THIS HAS TO BE AN URBAN DESIGN PLAN, WHICH
LOOKS INTO ALL THE ACTORS. IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM IN AN EQUALLY
RESPONSIVE WAY FOR ALL ACTORS. I'M ALL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IN EVERY
WAY. BICYCLE SAFETY, PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, WHICH IS SOMETHING I WANT
WORK ON IN THIS TERM BECAUSE I THINK PEDESTRIAN SAFETY IS NOT
LOOKED AT IN THE WAY IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A CITY SO DENSE.
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE WAY THE CITY IS APPROACHING
THIS IS ALL DUE TO THE DEADLINE THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS ALLUDED TO.
THE MEDIAN DOWN THE CENTER IS THE RESULT OF TRAMS THAT WENT IN
I'M ASSUMING 1890S AND 1900, PEOPLE GETTING OFF THE TRAMS WERE HIT
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LANDING SPOT. THAT'S WHY THE MEDIAN IS THERE.
MEDIAN HAS TO GO. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE STREET, CURB
TO CURB, FIND A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FAVORABLY FOR EVERYONE. I
THINK IT CAN BE DONE. CAN BE IT DONE BY MARCH 2022? I HAVE NO IDEA,
PROBABLY NOT.
WE HAVE TO STOP LOOKING AT ALL OUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CHEAPEST
WAY IMAGINABLE. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IT COSTS MONEY TO DO
THINGS RIGHT. AND SAFE. AND GOOD FOR EVERYBODY AS MUCH AS


PAGE 58

May 24, 2021

POSSIBLE. NOW, I SUSPECT THE SOLUTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT HAS
BEEN PRESENTED WILL ALSO HAPPEN BETWEEN HARVARD AND PORTER
SQUARE. IF YOU HAVE SEEN AN UPRISING, MY NEIGHBORHOOD, IT IS
COMING. A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE TONIGHT FROM THAT
FURTHER DOWN NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION. AND
WE HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT INTELLIGENT, LONG TERM SOLUTION. THANK
YOU. I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE POLICY ORDER.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THE
BIKE SAFETY ORDINANCE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, THERE WAS A VERSION IN
2019 AND A VERSION IN 2020. PART OF THE REASON FOR PUTTING IN
DEADLINES WAS BECAUSE THE CITY ACTUALLY HAD A BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE
PLAN AND A BIKE NETWORK AND ALL THINGS FOR MANY YEARS. IT WASN'T
MOVING VERY QUICKLY ON ITS IMPLEMENTATION. SO, WE DISCUSSED AND
VOTED TO PUT DEADLINES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THINGS WERE GOING
TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILT THE WAY THE CITY HAD
THIS NETWORK WOULD BE CREATED.
THAT'S WHERE THE DEADLINES CAME FROM. I'LL SAY OUTREACH, AND I
CRITICIZE THE CITY PLENTY WHEN IT COMES TO PROCESS WHEN I FEEL IT IS
DESERVED AND I KNOW IT IS NEVER PERFECT. CERTAINLY, IT WASN'T
NECESSARILY PERFECT IN THIS CASE EITHER. COUNCILLOR NOLAN
MENTIONED CAMBRIDGE STREET. THERE WAS A WORKING GROUP. THERE
WAS A PROCESS. AND BUSINESSES WERE AT THE TABLE AND RESIDENTS
WERE AT THE TABLE AND BIKE ADVOCATES. I DON'T THINK A CONSENSUS
WAS REACHED. I DON'T KNOW. I HOPE WE CAN REACH SOME TYPE OF
CONSENSUS TO MITIGATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. PART OF THE
PURPOSE OF A QUICK BUILD, PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE AND IT IS
EVALUATED. YOU SEE WHAT CHANGES CAN HAPPEN. I HOPE AND I DON'T
THINK I NEED A MOTION FOR THIS. IF I DO, I WILL BRING IT NEXT WEEK.
I WOULD LIKE I HOPE TRAFFIC AND PARKING CAN PUT OUT SOME KIND OF
FACT SHEET AS TO WHERE THINGS STAND. I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SO
MANY DISCUSSIONS. THERE ARE HANDICAP SPOTS, IN THE LATEST VERSION
THEY ARE ADDING SOME, I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. UNLESS
YOU WERE NOT AT THE RECENT MEETINGS YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT. THERE
WERE OTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND CHANGES AND WERE MADE TO THE
PLAN. I THINK SOMETHING A FACT SHEET OF SOME KIND FOR THE
COMMUNITY WOULD BE HELPFUL. I THINKS THERE A LOT OF
MISUNDERSTANDING. WITH THAT, I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT MY OTHER
COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY. THE ONLY REASON I WOULD BE WILLING TO
VOTE FOR THIS AND I THINK I WILL, THE FACT IT DOESN'T STOP
IMPLEMENTATION. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD, STUFF MOVED FORWARD
ALREADY. IF WE MAKE CHANGES, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT PAINT AND
SIGNAGE. I AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR CARLONE. THE MEDIAN HAS TO GO.
THAT'S A LONG TERM PLAN IS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET WORKING ON.
UNTIL THEN, I THINK THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS. I
AGREE WITH COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS


PAGE 59

May 24, 2021

POLICY ORDER. THE PROJECT IS ALMOST DONE, THANKFULLY. THE REASON IT
NEEDED TO BE DONE NOW IS THAT THE BIKE LANES ARE IN PLACE BEFORE
THE TEMPERATURES GET TOO COLD TO DO THIS WORK. I TOOK THE PLEDGE
TO SUPPORT THE ORDINANCE AS I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES DID. I
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE SO NEGATIVE ON THE PROJECTS WHEN THEY
HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THE ORDINANCE. IN
TERMS OF PARKING, THEY ARE ADDING HANDICAP SPOTS THAT WERE NOT
THERE BEFORE. AND WE PUT METERED PARKING PART OF THE DAY ON THE
SIDE STREETS, WHICH IS THE CORRECT SOLUTION. WE HAVE DONE THAT IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY. WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WE CONTINUE
TO ADD BIKE LANES. PRESERVING CAR STORAGE ON THIS ROAD IS THE
WORST USE OF THIS ROAD SPACE. WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT. WE'RE NOT
GOING TO NEED THE SPACES IN A FEW YEARS. IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN
ACCOMMODATE THE PARKING NEEDS THROUGH THE SIDE STREETS. I'M NOT
COMFORTABLE SECOND GUESSING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. I'M SURE THEIR
ANALYSIS AND HAVE COME TO THEIR CONCLUSION. IF THERE IS A DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION, I'M SURE THEY WILL COME BACK.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO BE SECOND GUESSING THEM ON THESE ISSUES. I
WILL BE VOTING NO. I AGREE WE SHOULD LOOK AT A LONGER TERM
SOLUTION THAT INVOLVES REMOVING THE MEDIAN. IF WE DO THAT, WE
DON'T PUT CAR STORAGE BACK ON THE STREET. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THAT'S NOT THE BEST USE OF THE ROAD SPACE. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE
THE COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTION AND STICK WITH IT. I'M VOTING NOTE.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THE POLICY
ORDER. THE LAST ORDERED AGREES THE REQUEST OF THE REPORTS DOESN'T
IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT PLANNED ON MASS AVENUE
BETWEEN DUDLEY STREET AND ALEWIFE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN THIS WEEK. I
GUARANTEE YOU, TOMORROW MORNING, THEY WILL BE OUT THERE
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT. PEOPLE DRIVING ON MASS
AVENUE, WE GOT EMAILS OVER THE WEEKEND, PEOPLE THIS LANE MERGE
THAT COMES ON TOP OF THEM, AND NEAR ACCIDENTS. THERE IS NO
PLANNING PROCESS. THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED AND I UNDERSTAND IT IS THE
CITY LAW, THE RESIDENTS HAVEN'T BEEN TREATED WITH ANY TYPE OF
RESPECT OR CONSULTATION ON ANY OF THIS. UNTIL AFTER THE FACT. AND
ALL THEIR CONCERNS, HUNDREDS OF PETITIONS AND NAMES ARE BEING
IGNORED. BE QUITE HONEST ABOUT THAT. ABSOLUTELY BEING IGNORED.
NO INPUT. COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, TOMORROW MORNING I
GUARANTEE MORE WORK WILL BE DONE TO IMPLEMENT THIS BIKE LANES.
AND EVERY ONE SPEAKING TONIGHT, A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
THERE ARE. THAT'S WHY THERE SHOULD BE A PAUSE UNTIL EVERYBODY
KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON HOW WE'LL IMPLEMENT
THIS POLICY. TO ME, I DON'T THINK IT IS AT THE RIGHT SPOT THAT PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THIS OR SUPPORTIVE OF IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR THE BICYCLISTS AND
WHAT COUNCILLOR CARLONE SAID ABOUT THE PEDESTRIANS. PEDESTRIANS
IS LIKE OPEN SEASON OF PEDESTRIANS OUT THERE. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.


PAGE 60

May 24, 2021

WE ARE GIVEN FALSE HOPE TO THE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS OWNERS. AND
THE DEATH FOR A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES. NO QUESTION IN MY MIND IT
WILL HAPPEN. IF THAT IS THE WAY WE WANT TO SEE ON THE MAJOR
THOROUGHFARES WITH CLOSED BUSINESSES, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE
REALITY. PEOPLE WHO INVESTED THEIR LIFESAVINGS AND EVERYTHING IN
THE BUSINESSES, THEY WILL BE FINANCIAL HURT. THIS IDEA WE'LL PUT
PARKING METERS ON THE SIDE STREETS TO TAKE AWAY RESIDENTIAL PARKING
FROM THOSE RESIDENTS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED. THAT WON'T SOLVE
ANYTHING THE RESIDENTIAL STREETS BEING USED WITH THE PARKING
METERS. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP AND ONLY GOING TO CAUSE MORE
CONSTERNATION FROM THE RESIDENTS. EVERYBODY SAYS THERE'S A LOT OF
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, BUT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND RAMMING
THIS DOWN EVERYBODY'S THROATS. IT IS UNFORTUNATE AND SO
DISRESPECTFUL TO I THINK WE HAVE A BOOK STORE, 90 YEARS IN EXISTENCE
AT THE LOCATION, I JUST THINK IT IS UNFORTUNATE. I WON'T SUPPORT THIS
POLICY ORDER. IF ANYTHING, WE SHOULD TAKE A COMPLETE PAUSE AND GO
BACK TO SQUARE ONE AND START OVER. I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF THE
BICYCLISTS, PEDESTRIANS AND WANT MOTORISTS ONCE IMPLEMENTED
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD TO ALL THOSE
PARTIES INVOLVED. PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, AND MOTORISTS. I WILL VOTE
NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FURTHER DISCUSSION? HEARING NONE, WE CAN
MOVE TO VOTE THIS UP OR DOWN?

POLICY ORDER NUMBER 2). THIS WAS COMING OUT OF PREVIOUS
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ELECTION COMMISSION WAS BEFORE US. AND
THERE WAS A REQUEST TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE USE OF POLLING
LOCATIONS AND OTHER RELATED THINGS TO THE ELECTION. AND SO, I
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A CONVERSATION,
ESPECIALLY WITH THE ELECTION BEING FRESH AND NOT PUSH IT OUT. AND
THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THE REQUEST. I CHECKED WITH
THEM FIRST AS THE COMMITTEE THERE HAS HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS
AROUND THE USE OF SCHOOL BUILDINGS. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO COME TOGETHER TO HEAR
EACH OTHER ON THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT FROM THE
DISCUSSIONS.

POLICY ORDER #1
That the City Council go on
record recognizing November
18th, 2021 as Pancreatic
Cancer Awareness Day in the
City of Cambridge
POLICY ORDER #3
That the Regular City Council
meeting scheduled for Monday,
December 27, 2021, be and
hereby is cancelled.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS
FORWARD. I THINK IT IS AN IDEAL TIME TO HAVE A ROUNDTABLE AFTER THE
HOLIDAY WEEKEND. MY QUESTION, THIS RELATES TO THE ELECTION
COMMISSION AND SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REDISTRICTING AND SO
MANY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AROUND THAT. THERE IS QUITE A
CONSTERNATION AND CONCERN OVER THE FACT THE STATE HAS COME OUT
WITH A REDISTRICTING, IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PRECINCTS WE HAVE. THEY
ARE SPLIT. AND I WONDER IF THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED TO GET A REPORT
AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE ELECTION COMMISSION IS ON THAT OR IF
THAT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF BRINGING FORWARD TO
THIS ROUNDTABLE. I THINK WITH POLLING, THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GET AN UPDATE. IF SO DO WE HAVE TO AMEND THIS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I CHECKED WITH THE CLERK ON THIS EARLIER.
INCLUDED THE LANGUAGE INTENTIONALLY AND THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS, WE WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER ON THAT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO. I THINK IT ENCOMPASSES IT AND I STATED THE CITY MANAGER, I
WILL DO AGENDA PLANNING AROUND THIS. AND IF YOU ALL HAVE
QUESTIONS AROUND THE REDISTRICTING, MY HOPE IS THAT THE
COMMISSION WILL BE READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO
THAT. IF NOT, IF THERE ARE VERY IF YOU THINK THE QUESTIONS WILL

REQUIRE DETAILS, I RECOMMEND YOU LETTING ME KNOW.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: OKAY. THANK YOU. THERE WILL BE A CALL TO SEND
QUESTIONS AND THAT CAN BE PART OF THE AGENDA, IF THAT MAKES SENSE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WILL ALLOW QUESTIONS PLEASE DO SEND ME
QUESTIONS, SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE TO ANY OF THE POTENTIAL
TOPICS. IT IS ONLY A TWO HOUR MEETING.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I APOLOGIZE, ARE ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS
TELEVISED? GREAT. THIS WILL BE TELEVISED. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? HEARING NONE... CLERK? DO
WE HAVE TO MAKE THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION OR ASK TO MAKE THIS
TELEVISED? I WANT TO CONFIRM? WE CHANGED THE RULES.
>> UNDERSTANDING IS ALL ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS ARE TELEVISED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CHANGED THE RULES TO REQUIRE THAT. I WANTED
TO BE COVERED. MOVE TO ADOPT.

COUNCIL FROM HEATHER HOFFMAN IN CONNECTION WITH THE CITY
COUNCIL'S MEETING ON NOVEMBER 1. THE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT IS IN
THE FILE. THE CITY SOLICITOR STATES I'M REQUESTING THE COUNCIL VOTE
TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY SOLICITOR TO DRAFT A RESPONSE TO THE
COMPLAINT FOR APPROVAL BY THE COUNCIL NO LATER THAN THE CITY THE
CITY COUNCIL'S MEETING OF NOVEMBER 29TH. WE HAVE A ROUNDTABLE TO
APPROVE. THE SUGGESTED LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE AROUND THIS, I
THINK WE SHOULD SUSPEND THE RULES TO BRING A LATE ORDER FORWARD
SO THAT WE CAN VOTE TO AUTHORIZE THIS RESPONSE. I SUGGEST WE DO A
ROLL CALL ON SUSPENSION AND THIS IS THE LANGUAGE THAT I WILL
ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR.

MEETING ON NOVEMBER 8, 2021. IT IS THE PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
WE WANT TO ADD A DATE? GO AHEAD.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I GUESS I'M OPEN TO ADDING A DATE, I'M NOT
SURE IF WE NEED TO. I WANTED TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE
COMPLAINT. THE APPLICATION AND PETITION ISSUE WAS RESOLVED
THROUGH ME EXERCISING MY CHARTER RIGHT. THAT WAS DEFERRED BY ONE
WEEK AND THEN THE TWO COMMITTEE MEETING REPORTS ACTUALLY WERE
FIXED PRIOR TO THE MEETING. I BELIEVE PERHAPS MS. HOFFMAN WASN'T
AWARE OF THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO ACCESS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING, THE SOLICITOR WILL
RESPOND. THE PROCESS IS TO HAVE HER RESPONSE TO THE COMPLAINT. I
THINK SHE'LL INCORPORATE WHAT MOST OF WHAT YOU STATED. AND THE
PURPOSE IS WE WERE ADVISED THIS IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH GIVEN OPEN
MEETING LAW AND EVERYTHING, WE AS THE COUNCIL HAVE TO VOTE TO GET
OUR SOLICITOR TO RESPOND TO THAT COMPLAINT FROM THEIR OFFICE.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I'M HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS. I WOULD THINK PART
OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION IS TO RESPOND TO AN OPEN MEETING LAW
COMPLAINT. I'M CURIOUS I'M NOT SURE IF I VOTED ON THIS KIND OF
DIRECTION. IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO? ANYTIME THERE'S AN
OPEN MEETING LAW COMPLAINT, WE HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY SAY PLEASE
RESPOND.
>> THROUGH YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, I DON'T SPECIFICALLY HAVE HAVEN'T
LOOKED UP THE PROCEDURE FOR AN OPEN MEETING LAW COMPLAINT.
FROM MEMORY, I BELIEVE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THE BOARD IS APPRISED
AND THE BELIEVE THE SOLICITOR IS LOOKING FOR A FORMAL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT SHE RESPOND ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL,
WHICH IS THE BODY THAT THE COMPLAINT IS MADE AGAINST.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND WE SHOULD BE
APPRISED. THAT WOULD BE A COMMUNICATION SAYING HERE IT IS. I'M
HAPPY TO VOTE FOR IT. THAT MIGHT BE CLARIFIED SO IN THE FUTURE WE
DON'T HAVE TO VOTE ON THIS IF THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC REFERRAL. THANK
YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: A QUICK COMMENT. I DON'T RECALL EVER
HAVING TO DO THIS BEFORE IN THE EIGHT YEARS. I'M NOT QUESTIONING
DOING IT TODAY, I'M JUST ADDING THAT INFORMATION. I KNOW WE'RE
DOING SOME THINGS MORE CORRECTLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAN
POSSIBLY BEFORE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I WILL CLARIFY IT. I WILL CLARIFY IT FOR
THE FUTURE. WE HAVE A LATE ORDER BEFORE US.

RECOGNIZE HER. AND I HOPE THROUGH THE PROGRAM THE WE DO IN THE
