▪ The City of Cambridge’s capital spending/public investment is a direct reflection of its priorities as a
community and is shaped by many inputs.
▪ In making bonding decisions, the City must consider not only its debt policies but also constraints on
operating budget growth (i.e., debt service costs crowding out other priorities) and tax levy growth.
▪ Looking ahead, there are several large public investment projects in the FY24-FY28 bond schedule;
most are associated with existing commitments or deferred maintenance.
▪ Even without adding projects to the FY25-FY28 bond schedule, the City is at risk of approaching or
exceeding internal debt policy limits in upcoming years.
▪ Emerging needs from ongoing program areas (e.g., School Buildings, BEUDO, Combined Sewer
Overflow Control, Municipal Facilities, Complete Streets) will require changes to our bond schedule
such as adjusting project timelines and/or scope.
▪ Decisions about the FY25 capital budget will affect future public investments bond schedules, as well
as our operating budget and debt service costs, for several years.
▪ We will be working to prioritize and determine tradeoffs required to meet community needs and
preserve financial flexibility.
▪ Today, we are sharing updated projections for the FY24-FY28 bond schedule. We will be bringing
proposed FY25 capital appropriations and loan authorizations for the Council’s approval in May 2024.

City Council approves a $90M loan authorization for a construction project for the FY25 capital budget
Starting in FY25, 10-year bonds are issued for this project ($30M / year for 3 years) at a 3% true interest cost (based on
construction spending)
Each of the 3 bond issuances then incur 10 years of debt service costs (repayment of debt principal + interest), starting the
year after the associated bond issuance. Assume that debt principal is repaid evenly across a 10-year period

The City must consider not only its internal debt policies, set to maintaina
long-term financial health and flexibility…

…it must also consider constraints on its operating budget growth
and tax levy growth
We will need to moderate operating budget growth and tax levy growth to avoid eroding our excess
levy capacity. As a component of the operating budget, debt service costs must be moderated as well.

The Council passed Complete Streets & Vision Zero policies in 2016:

Complete Streets
& Vision Zero

▪ The Complete Streets program ensures that streets are designed and
operated to enable safe access for all users (pedestrians, bicyclists,
motorists, and transit users) of all ages and abilities
▪ Vision Zero calls for the elimination of fatalities and serious injuries resulting
from traffic crashes
The Council passed the Ordinance in 2016 with amendments in 2020, which:

Cycling Safety
Ordinance

Building Energy
Use Disclosure
Ordinance
(BEUDO)
Combined Sewer
Overflows (CSO)


▪ Supports the City’s commitment to Vision Zero and the construction of a
connected network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City
▪ Aims to increase the rate that separated bike lanes are created by adding
requirements for the installation of ~25 miles of separated bike lanes
The Council passed the Ordinance in 2014, with amendments in 2023:

▪ Key goal: Reduce the City’s greenhouse gas emissions
▪ BEUDO will require large municipal buildings to reach Net Zero Emissions
by 2035, while all municipal buildings must reach Net Zero Emissions by
2050
Following the MA State Variances for CSO Discharges to the Charles River
Basin and the Alewife Brook/Upper Mystic River Basin, the City is collaborating
with MWRA, Somerville, MassDEP and EPA to develop a CSO Control Plan
for the 12 CSO outfalls the City owns & operates
