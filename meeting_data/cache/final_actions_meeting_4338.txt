RE:

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance – Proposed Amendments

SANDRA CLARKE
Deputy Director
Chief of Administration

KHALIL MOGASSABI
Deputy Director
Chief Planner

Please find attached proposed amendments to the Building Energy Use Disclosure
Ordinance. The Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) was
adopted in 2014 and requires energy and water reporting from commercial
properties over 25,000 square feet and residential properties over 50 units. This
regulates approximately 1,100 buildings in Cambridge which are responsible for
approximately 75% of the building sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
The ordinance has successfully increased transparency and awareness of energy
and water consumption by the regulated buildings. BEUDO includes a provision
requiring that the Community Development Department review the impact of the
ordinance on energy performance of covered properties, and recommend
amendments to improve building energy performance if it has not improved
significantly. Analysis performed in 2018 concluded that energy performance of
covered properties had not improved significantly and therefore CDD initiated a
performance requirement policy development process with participation of over
35 unique entities, representing private commercial and residential building
owners, universities, affordable housing providers, and green building
professionals. The attached proposal is the result of this collaborative process.
These proposed BEUDO amendments are intended to introduce GHG
performance requirements for BEUDO properties and achieve science-based
GHG reductions consistent with other leading cities including Boston, New York,
and Washington D.C. The performance requirements:
•

Cambridge, MA 02139
Voice: 617 349-4600
Fax: 617 349-4669
TTY: 617 349-4621
www.cambridgema.gov

Eliminate GHG emissions from regulated properties by 2050, with the
following intermediate targets compared to an individual 2018-2019
baseline for most buildings:
o 20% by 2025
o 40% by 2030

Community Development Department

o 60% by 2035
o 80% by 2040
o 90% by 2045
•

Provide multiple compliance pathways including energy efficiency
improvements, electrification, on-site renewable energy, off-site
renewable energy, electricity grid improvements, and alternative
compliance payments.

•

Provide flexibility including an optional early baseline to account for early
action, alternative compliance timeframes for laboratories and affordable
housing, and portfolio level compliance for campus owners and affordable
housing.

•

Leverage technical support and access to state and federal financial
incentives through the existing Building Energy Retrofit Program.

The attached proposal for amendments to BEUDO represents an essential step in
Cambridge’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. The Net Zero Action Plan
adopted in 2015 and updated in 2021 identifies BEUDO performance
requirements as an integral part of a comprehensive suite of actions which
together will phase out GHG emissions from new buildings, many existing
buildings, and much of the energy supply system in Cambridge. This Plan has
been created and updated by a Net Zero Task Force representing stakeholders
throughout the community and is being overseen by the Climate Protection
Advisory Committee. Both stakeholder groups have urged the prompt
advancement of strong BEUDO performance requirements.
We are pleased to present these amendments to move forward the discussion of
emission reductions from the largest buildings in Cambridge based on a
comprehensive and collaborative stakeholder engagement process.

Exemptions: A Covered Property will be exempted by the Department from the
requirements of 8.67.100 if it qualifies as one of the following:
(a) New construction: For Covered Properties that receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Covered Properties shall be exempt
from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the five years following the conclusion of this
Baseline period. The performance requirements for each subsequent five-year
period shall be determined by a linear reduction to net zero emissions by 2050.
(b) A Net Zero Emissions Building;
(c) Vacancy: The Covered Property is fully vacant for the full year;
(d) The Covered Property is to be fully demolished within the forthcoming calendar
year;
(e) Financial Distress: Owners of a financially distressed Covered Property may apply for
an extension until the end of the current compliance period. Owners must provide a
form of third-party verification to substantiate an exemption request due to
financial distress. A building is considered in financial distress if it meets one of the
following criteria:
(i) The Covered Property is qualified for sale at a public auction due to arrears of
public taxes within two years of the start of the compliance period.
(ii) The Covered Property is controlled by a court-appointed receiver due to financial
distress.
(iii) The Covered Property is owned by a financial institution through default by the
borrower.
(iv) The Covered Property has been acquired by deed in lieu of foreclosure.
(v) The Covered Property has a senior mortgage which is subject to a notice of
default.
The following building type-specific compliance pathways shall be permitted:
(a) Campus:
(i) A Campus may choose to comply with the requirements of Section 8.67.100 at
the level of each Covered Property or at the level of the aggregate Campus

greenhouse gas emissions. Campus Owners must determine their Baseline
according to the method by which they intend to comply with the requirements.
Owners may request to adjust their Baseline to include in the aggregate Campus
any new buildings that receive their Certificate of Occupancy after the start of the
Baseline years.
(ii) If the Covered Property that is part of a Campus is included in an institutional
comprehensive plan and a corresponding energy management plan, and these
plans have reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions from buildings at the institutional
level by the required amount for that compliance period, then the Covered
Property shall be considered to be in compliance. To show compliance with this
pathway, the Owner must provide copies of the institutional comprehensive plan,
institutional energy management plan, and the completed institution-wide
greenhouse gas inventory for buildings for the compliance period.
(b) Laboratories and Affordable Housing:
(i) Laboratories and Affordable Housing shall have the option to comply with the
following alternative compliance schedule:
1. Compliance Period 1: 2027 to 2033; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 66.7% of the default Baseline
2. Compliance Period 2: 2034 to 2040; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 33.3% of the default Baseline
3. Compliance Period 3: 2041 to 2049; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will
not exceed 16.6% of the default Baseline
4. Compliance Period 4: 2050 onwards; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions are
net zero.
(ii) Laboratory and Affordable Housing owners choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit documentation to the Department showing
that the Covered Property qualifies as a Laboratory or Affordable Housing at the
start of each 5-year compliance period.
(iii) Laboratories and Affordable Housing choosing to follow the alternative
compliance schedule shall submit a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan to
the Department four years prior to the start of each alternative compliance
period detailing how the greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirement for
that compliance cycle will be met.
(iv) For newly constructed Laboratories and Affordable Housing that choose to follow
the alternative compliance schedule and receive an initial Certificate of
Occupancy after the start of the default Baseline years, the Baseline shall be the
average Greenhouse Gas Emissions of the first two full calendar years following
the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. Such Laboratories and Affordable
Housing shall be exempt from the requirements of 8.67.100 for the seven years
following the conclusion of this Baseline period. The performance requirements
for each subsequent seven-year period shall be determined by a linear reduction
to net zero emissions by 2050.
(v) For Laboratories and Affordable Housing that request an alternative Baseline
pursuant to 8.67.100 (2), the adjusted performance requirements shall be as
follows; annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions will not exceed the indicated

City Councilor BEUDO Ques�on and Answer Following April 12, 2023 Ordinance Commitee Hearing
Councilor ques�ons are listed in italics followed by staﬀ responses in regular text
Covered Properties
1. Are all nonproﬁts now exempt (religious, educational institutions, charities, etc.)?
Nonproﬁt buildings that meet the BEUDO size thresholds are not exempt, but under the
proposal if they are under 100,000sf then they are placed on the 2050 net zero trajectory, and
any building may apply to the Review Board for an individual hardship compliance plan that is
deemed jus�ﬁed. Given the range of nonproﬁt BEUDO property owners that include both small
community organiza�ons and large ins�tu�ons, allowing for case-by-case ﬂexibility is important
given the diversity of our city.
2. Residential is still required to meet goals by 2050 except for Condominiums. You mentioned that you
will diﬀerentiate between large residential property owners who you believe can meet the requirements
by 2050 and those who may face challenges in meeting these goals. What criteria will be used? Is there
a list of properties that you already have identiﬁed? Will this be legally defensible if challenged by those
deemed capable of meeting the goals we are setting and are not given an exemption or additional
leeway in meeting the goals?
The only proposed dis�nc�on for residen�al proper�es is condominiums, which would be
exempt. All remaining rental proper�es that are subject to BEUDO (50+ units) would be covered
on a gradual 2050 net zero trajectory. As with all covered proper�es, an individual residen�al
property can apply for an individual hardship compliance plan from the Review Board if
necessary.
3. How diﬃcult is it to address commercial condo concerns and include commercial condos along with
residential condominiums?
In contrast to residen�al condominiums, commercial condos are some of the highest-emi�ng
BEUDO buildings (for example, One Hampshire St: 30,000 tons/year; Mt Auburn Hospital: 10,000
tons/year) so it is important that they remain covered under the amendments. It is expected
that commercial condos also have greater capacity to meet the BEUDO requirements, and they
can pe��on the Review Board to address building-speciﬁc challenges.
4. I am concerned about unintended consequences, speciﬁcally applying these to large apartment
buildings and other commercial buildings will most likely lead to tenant/small business displacement
while property owners are making the improvements. This will also lead to future increases in rental
costs which will be driven by property owners’ desire to recoup their costs, making it even more diﬃcult
for lower- and middle-income families and small businesses to remain in Cambridge. Could we include all
residential buildings in the exemptions allowed for condominiums?

a

Most other building performance standards include all residen�al buildings over a certain size
threshold. The City’s amendment proposal maintains single-owner rental residen�al proper�es
under BEUDO for the following reasons:
a. BEUDO performance requirements for rental proper�es gives them a predictable pace of
emission reduc�ons between 2030 and 2050, facilita�ng advanced planning and
supported by City resources
b. Single-owner rental proper�es have centralized decision-making which facilitates capital
planning and upgrades
c. Lower emission buildings can be healthier and more comfortable to live in and come
with lower energy costs for tenants unable to make upgrades on their own
5. I thought it was very interesting that the city has 40 properties that will need to comply with BEUDO. I
also appreciate the observation that allowing carbon oﬀsets will allow us to avoid making “bad quick ﬁx
investments” rather than allowing for more time to ﬁnd the right solutions for the longer term. Could we
get a bit more detailed workplan for what the BEUDO amendments would mean for the City’s buildings?
As a city how much will we need to start putting aside annually in our budget to meet these goals for our
own buildings? What are the tax implications?
It will be a signiﬁcant challenge for the City to meet the 2035 goals, but we are commited to do
this. However, it will require the use of vPPAs and carbon oﬀsets.
•

Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (vPPAs) will signiﬁcantly reduce the City’s GHG
emissions from electricity consump�on by providing 100% renewable electricity from
new renewable energy projects. The remaining emissions from on-site fossil fuel
combus�on are more challenging to eliminate quickly.

•

For 2035, the reason for using carbon oﬀsets is due to the complexity of large capital
projects. It will be very diﬃcult to conduct HVAC retroﬁts on the City’s largest buildings,
such as CRLS, War Memorial, Main Library, and the Water Treatment Plant by 2035. The
ﬂexibility to apply carbon oﬀsets is important to allow us to reach 2035 goals without
having to priori�ze quick-ﬁx par�al electriﬁca�on projects that do not actually improve
the eﬃciency or address other signiﬁcant needs for the buildings.
o

While it may be technically possible on some buildings to perform limited-scope
conversion of natural gas boilers to electric, there are a number of signiﬁcant
poten�al downsides to this approach:


Unless accompanied by other improvements, simply changing to an electric
boiler will be less eﬃcient than current systems



Does not address overall building systems, many of which are past their useful
life or failing. Would s�ll require future improvements



May trigger an electrical service upgrade, which will be cost and �me intensive



Even a limited scope project could require reloca�on of occupants for up to a
year, while not no�ceably improving user experience or comfort



•

Preferable to convert these HVAC systems to electric as part of a comprehensive
phased plan of building renova�ons towards the 2050 target date. This allows
full systems improvements which will reduce GHG emissions, make the
buildings more eﬃcient, and address user needs and comfort.

Through two ongoing parallel studies, the Municipal Facili�es Improvement Plan (MFIP)
and School Assessment & Masterplan, we will con�nue ongoing phased building
renova�on projects to achieve net zero emissions for the por�olio by 2050.

Financing and Incentives:
1. Have we thought about oﬀering incentives for people who reach their goal faster? I don't know what
that would be, but just wondering if it was discussed.
The CDD team has considered oﬀering addi�onal incen�ves but ul�mately decided that it would
be overly complicated to create a secondary set of targets that would reward building owners for
moving faster than the exis�ng proposed set of targets. Building owners that meet their goals
ahead of schedule will beneﬁt by being in compliance for subsequent years, ge�ng recogni�on
for ac�ng earlier, and contribu�ng to solving our global climate crisis.
2. The $10 million fund that will be used to support residents and property owners make the shift – is that
$10million annually or one time allotment? Can you provide some additional details about what it may
be used for, eg. consultant fees vs. incentive assistance?
The $10M is expected to be spent over a 5 year period from 2025-2029, or about $2M/year. It
will be used to help smaller BEUDO commercial buildings and BEUDO residen�al buildings make
plans and access technical support and ﬁnancial incen�ves to achieve their emission reduc�on
trajectories over �me. This could include covering the cost of energy audits and reviewing results
to then make capital project improvement plans over �me, taking into account the emissions
proﬁle of each building, capital improvement needs, and alignment with state and federal
incen�ves.
3. PACE – Can you tell us more about PACE and how it can help us meet the goals?
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) is an addi�onal ﬁnancing mechanism that, if Cambridge
opts in, would be available to commercial buildings and residen�al buildings with 5 or more
units. PACE loans are administered through MassDevelopment and payments are collected via
property tax bills (though the City is not a party to the loan). The main advantage of PACE
ﬁnancing for clean energy projects is that the loan rides with the property for up to 20 years,
enabling retroﬁts with long-term payback periods to pencil out even if the current owner may
sell the property before the investment has paid back, since the loan payment and any energy
savings will con�nue to accrue to the new property owner.

4. Bloc Power – I heard that there are no upfront costs and they provide ﬁnancing but what is the long
term cost to the residents / property owner?
The BlocPower ﬁnancing approach is an energy services model where the property owner(s)
have no upfront cost and a predictable lease payment over �me followed by a buy-out op�on for
the installed measures. The speciﬁc cost depends on the scope of work being done and the
circumstances of the building; in some cases, the monthly lease payment may be less than
exis�ng energy bills thanks to energy eﬃciency, solar, and/or lower-cost fuels (e.g. improved
insula�on, buildings transi�oning oﬀ of oil or electric resistance), but in other cases the monthly
payments may be higher. The maintenance and replacement costs of exis�ng systems should
also be taken into account in comparing long-term costs.
Carbon Credits/Oﬀsets:
1. Are we able to identify a set of oﬀsets, eg. restricted to a local area, that we can verify and designate
as the only options for investment by our property owners and institutions to address the criticism that
not all carbon credits are equal?
See separate memo on carbon oﬀsets
Enforcement and Review
1. How will we be monitoring and enforcing the ordinance? Will it be self-reporting by the property
owners, or will we be employing additional city staﬀ to review and enforce? What are the budget
implications?
Repor�ng of BEUDO data will con�nue to be done using the Federally-supported Energy Star
Por�olio Manager so�ware and the Building Energy Analysis Manager (BEAM) pla�orm which
allow for standardiza�on and build-in quality control of reported data. While data is selfreported, owners can opt to have their reports link directly to their u�lity accounts and thirdparty veriﬁca�on of the baseline year and ﬁrst year of each compliance period is included in the
proposed amendments. Enforcement will be carried out using these data pla�orms for input and
the Viewpoint system used by Inspec�onal Services and other departments for tracking. The
Community Development Department currently has one full-�me employee dedicated to
BEUDO administra�on and will be hiring a second staﬀ person in FY24 to add capacity to these
du�es as well as the development and provision of informa�onal resources and connec�ons to
technical support.
2. On the issue of emergency fossil fuel backup systems allowed until 2030 - Are we certain that they will
not be necessary beyond 2030? Is there harm having them in place if they are not actually used except in
an emergency?
The proposed exemp�on of emissions from fossil fueled emergency backup systems will be
included in the proposed 2031 review. At that �me, the impacts of the backup generators along

a

with the technical and economic feasibility of alterna�ves will be considered to determine
whether the exemp�on should be extended.
3. A review schedule of 2031 is too late. Would there be any reason not to review this policy in 2028
which would be in line with the review timeline in the current ordinance - 5 years. At that time, the
industry will have evolved, there’d be an experience base, and two years of data on the large buildings
would be in hand to inform any adjustments.
Yes, a 2028 review would allow for planning and adjustments in advance of the 2030 compliance
period. However, under the current proposal only the largest buildings will have performance
requirements to meet before 2028, so performance data will be limited. Therefore, an addi�onal
review is recommended a�er the 2030 compliance period which includes all covered proper�es.
Policy Design and Impacts
1. Why are we attempting to meet net zero by 2035, 15 years ahead of Boston and the Commonwealth?
What makes us so special? I heard testimony that other cities have a 2035 goal - What other cities are
committed to 2035 here and nationally?
Staﬀ are not aware of other ci�es in the US that have commited to a 2035 net zero target. In
line with recent calls from the Interna�onal Panel on Climate Change for accelerated ac�on,
many leading local and na�onal ins�tu�ons and corpora�ons are commi�ng to near-term
targets with ﬂexibility measures built in:
•

Harvard aims to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and MIT aims to achieve net zero
emissions by 2026—both made possible only with their use of high-quality global carbon
oﬀsets.

•

Walmart (excluding their supply chain) commits to reaching zero emissions in their
opera�ons by 2040, without the use of global carbon oﬀsets, but notes in the ﬁne print
that mee�ng this goal is dependent on many factors, including “innova�on and
technology that is not available today”.

2. Who was a part of the process in crafting the most recent proposal? Can you clarify whether any
climate science leaders and residents who are not BEUDO building owners were included?
There was signiﬁcant engagement across all stakeholders, including climate science leaders,
residents, and the Cambridge Climate Commitee (then CPAC) at diﬀerent stages in the process
leading up to the original 2021 amendment proposal. The change from a 2050 to a 2035 net zero
target further represented the climate ac�vist perspec�ve, going beyond where the state, Boston,
and other ci�es around the country have gone. Work has been done since to determine how to
feasibly achieve this target, with an emphasis on the building owners and operators who will have to
meet them. In sum, the proposed approach is based on science-based targets backed by signiﬁcant
research and engagement.

3. Eversource and state resources – Cambridge is already well ahead of the curve compared to other
municipalities in Massachusetts. By pushing ahead for 2035 on our own, aren’t we essentially asking
Eversource to put our needs over other communities ﬁrst? Are we essentially hoarding energy resources
at the detriment of our neighboring communities?
In its presenta�on to the Economic Development and University Rela�on Commitee, Eversource
showed data indica�ng that Cambridge commercial and industrial electricity use is much higher
than the state averages. So while Eversource’s electricity incen�ves have been higher in
Cambridge, they are so in propor�on to the amount of electricity consumed (see table from
Eversource below). Furthermore, it is important to remember that the electrical grid is a
connected system that is not limited by municipal boundaries; investments in the grid in
Cambridge have impacts on neighboring communi�es and vice-versa. Eversource earns a return
on its infrastructure investments, so making investments in Cambridge is not necessarily
detrimental to other communi�es. Finally, even if the net zero deadline for large buildings is
accelerated to 2035, the needed investments in the grid will be spread out over �me as buildings
decarbonize using diﬀerent methods, including the poten�al use of carbon oﬀsets and district
energy systems that are not reliant on the local electrical grid.

4. I worry that these well intended goals may make Cambridge less competitive compared to other
communities without such aggressive timelines and that by raising the cost of building and doing
business in Cambridge at such an expedited pace we will see innovative new businesses go elsewhere.
Can you provide any assurances that this will not be the case?
While internalizing the cost of carbon emissions will come at a price, the broader economic
impacts of BEUDO amendments depend on the ul�mate content of the amendments along with
decisions of property owners in context of broader economic factors at the regional scale. While
the City cannot control these factors, Cambridge is lucky to have a very robust local economy
and the City has commited to providing technical support to covered proper�es with an
emphasis on helping to provide access to state and federal incen�ves to mi�gate the cost of

5. Do the ﬂexibility mechanisms you discussed (deferments of payments, multiple exceptions, review

challenged as a “tax”?
The 2021 memo from the City Solicitor was par�cularly focused on the use of alterna�ve
compliance credits (ACCs) and their impact on reducing GHG emissions as intended by the
broader ordinance. As long all compliance mechanisms under the ordinance directly lead to GHG
emission reduc�ons, then they would not be construed as a tax.

Net Zero and BEUDO: The Role of Carbon Offsets
Carbon offsets are a promising tool to help BEUDO properties achieve our net zero goals
Carbon offsets entered the BEUDO amendment conversation when the target date for achieving net zero
emissions was accelerated from 2050 to 2035, driving the need for additional flexibility in compliance
mechanisms. Under the current proposal, carbon offsets would be allowed to be used by buildings on
the 2035 trajectory in limited amounts to offset on-site fossil fuel emissions beginning in 2030 and
phasing down to 0 by 2050.
We must be diligent in our evaluation of carbon offset projects and ensure they meet high quality
standards. By doing so, we can reduce global emissions while investing in communities and supporting
emerging innovation and technology.
Carbon offsets are at an inflection point and we need to prepare for the changing landscape
Carbon offsets are a critical tool for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions while investing in the
most marginalized communities on the path to decarbonization, and demand for offsets continues to
grow. But existing offset projects vary in their rigor and credibility due to the challenge of ensuring
rigorous implementation in unregulated markets. For example, forestry conservation projects have faced
scrutiny about whether they truly reduce emissions compared to business as usual. On the other hand, a
voluntary carbon capture and sequestration project may be a good example of lasting emissions
reductions.
The integrity of carbon credits has been recognized internationally as a serious problem, leading to
significant efforts to develop market governance systems which are expected to continue over the next
several years. Last month, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM or Integrity
Council), released its Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) and Program-level Assessment Framework as a
“significant step forward for consistent transparency by requiring programs to publish comprehensive
information in an accessible manner so all stakeholders can understand how projects issuing CCPlabelled carbon credits impact emissions, society and the environment.”
Additionally, there are a number of rating agencies that are developing grading systems to evaluate
projects and flag risks. The four major rating agencies are:
•
•
•
•

Sylvera
BeZero
Calyx Global
Renoster Systems

Sylvera and Renoster specialize in nature-based projects while BeZero and Calyx assess a broader range
from cookstoves to methane capture.
Determining offsets criteria for BEUDO buildings will take time
Given the current inflection point in the global carbon offset market and the maturation of offset
governance expected to occur, having several years to detail BEUDO carbon offset criteria through a
regulatory process including additional public input will help Cambridge better identify acceptable
offsets for BEUDO compliance from either global or local sources.

Please see the attached Options Outline for a staff analysis on the pros and cons of setting criteria for:
1. Participation in global carbon markets
2. Restricting offsets use to existing local/regional markets, or
3. Creating a new local carbon fund
The key challenges of implementing rigorous offset standards and securing sufficient offset supply are
currently present within each considered option.
We also understand that BEUDO buildings may need support in identifying and accessing offsets that
meet the amendment criteria, and the City will consider options to provide this support, similar to the
facilitation of access to high-quality renewable electricity through the community aggregation program.

Op�on 1: Allow Global Carbon Oﬀsets Subject to Stringent Quality Criteria
Approach: Permit the largest commercial BEUDO buildings to use global carbon oﬀsets, subject to stringent
criteria that can ensure, to the extent possible, that the oﬀsets are of high quality and reduce emissions.
Risks: The quality of many oﬀset projects under exis�ng protocols is uncertain, as are their actual emissions
reduc�ons. Oﬀset projects typically receive their cer�ﬁca�ons from several private, NGO-operated oﬀset
protocols, each with diﬀerent stringency and approval processes. As a result, it is diﬃcult to determine if
oﬀset projects, even with cer�ﬁca�on, meet the proposed quality criteria. Most oﬀsets are bought and sold
as private transac�ons, not on an exchange, further reducing transparency; it appears that exis�ng exchanges
do not necessarily adhere to quality criteria.
Beneﬁts: Allowing global carbon credit would create further op�ons for BEUDO building owners to meet
emissions goals. Using an established protocol would streamline administra�on of the oﬀsets. BEUDO
investments could ﬂow to countries in need of clean energy and environmental support.
Example projects: Improved cookstoves to households in Guatemala (VCS-cer�ﬁed); Brazil forest
conserva�on (VCS-cer�ﬁed); wastewater methane capture at Texas agribusiness facili�es (VCS-cer�ﬁed); wind
farm project in Indonesia (Gold Standard-cer�ﬁed)
Poten�al methods to mi�gate risks: The applica�on of stringent criteria for oﬀsets would disqualify
ques�onable oﬀset projects and help ensure that oﬀsets used for BEUDO compliance are of high quality.
Consultant work for BEUDO amendments has iden�ﬁed overarching criteria for high-quality oﬀsets, based on
a review of best prac�ces from the GHG Management Ins�tute and the Stockholm Environment Ins�tute. The
criteria encompass:

•

Conduct an examination of the current offset protocols (e.g., American Carbon Registry, California
Compliance Offset Program, VCS, etc.) and understand how stringently these criteria are applied.
The quality of carbon offsets is a topic of global interest, and new international initiatives are working to
define protocols for high-quality offsets. Cambridge can follow these efforts and utilize a new or revised
offset protocol that meets the stringent quality criteria listed above.
Determine which protocol to apply when determining eligibility of offsets purchased for BEUDO
compliance, and what potential additional criteria would be required to ensure high quality, real
emissions reductions. Investigate the size of the market of projects that meet these criteria. Determine
approval process for any additional criteria.

Op�on 2: Allow Only Regional and Local Carbon Oﬀsets, Subject to Similar Quality Criteria
Approach: Allow the largest commercial BEUDO buildings to purchase oﬀsets from projects in New England
or another limited geographic region, similarly using criteria and cer�ﬁca�ons to ensure high quality.
Risks: As with global carbon credits, oﬀset project cer�ﬁca�ons are provided by several private, NGOoperated protocols, making it important to inves�gate that the projects meet the proposed quality criteria
and that they represent real emissions reduc�ons.
Beneﬁts: Investments from BEUDO buildings could poten�ally provide health and economic beneﬁts to the
region. Using oﬀsets that are local to the region could poten�ally improve transparency and veriﬁability, as
compared to global oﬀsets. For example, such an approach could draw on New England’s robust clean energy
tracking and point-source emissions repor�ng to help ensure addi�onality for such projects.
Examples of project veriﬁca�on in New England: As is generally the case with global carbon credits, there is
no established marketplace for oﬀsets in New England. However, the veriﬁca�on protocols described in
Op�on 1 have registered several dozen cer�ﬁed projects exist in New England, and there are nonproﬁt-run
programs to support New England forestry projects through the sale of carbon credits.
•

•
•

•

The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) certification has registered approximately 20 projects in New
England. The Climate Action Reserve also has a directory of project developers and brokers for
buying offsets.
The American Carbon Registry has registered 30 projects in New England.
RGGI, the Northeast cap-and-trade requirement for power plants, has an offset-approval process for
projects in the Northeast, to allow energy generators to use a small amount of offsets; currently, no
power plant operator is doing so.
Broader to the US, California’s cap-and-trade requirements allow regulated entities to use a small
amount (<8%) of offsets to meet their requirements, and half of the offset projects must be within
California. Other projects for California compliance have been developed across the US and globally.

Example projects: Landﬁll gas capture in Connec�cut (CAR-cer�ﬁed); forest conserva�on trust in Maine (CARcer�ﬁed); forest management in Maine (American Carbon Registry) and New Hampshire (American Carbon
Registry); farm methane capture in Vermont (CAR-cer�ﬁed); forest management in Michigan (for California
compliance)
Poten�al mi�ga�on measures:
Any New England-speciﬁc oﬀset would need to meet the same criteria described above to help ensure high
quality and to result in real emissions reduc�ons:
Poten�al next steps
•

•
•

Examine the current offset verification protocols, as above, and determine which would be
appropriate for New England-specific projects, and additional desired criteria. As above, the City
would also draw on international efforts to define new protocols for high-quality offsets.
Examining California’s protocols for ensuring that half of compliance offsets have California-specific
environmental benefits may also provide an example approach as well.
Engage project developers and verifiers to determine potential project volumes in New England.

Risks
•
•
•
•

Cost of program design and administration and potential duplication of international offset
protocol efforts
Legal complexity and potential roadblocks to local/third party administration
Uncertainty around supply of local GHG reduction projects which can lead to verifiable offsets
Uncertainty regarding uptake of local offsets and revenue into program

Beneﬁts

Additional local benefits such as green jobs and investment opportunities, accelerated GHG
reductions and health benefits

Mi�ga�on measures

The Guardian, 18 January 2023
Investigation into Verra carbon standard finds most are
‘phantom credits’ and may worsen global heating
• Only a handful of Verra’s rainforest projects showed evidence of
deforestation reductions, according to two studies, with further
analysis indicating that 94% of the credits had no benefit to the
climate.
• The threat to forests had been overstated by about 400% on average
for Verra projects, according to analysis of a 2022 University of
Cambridge study.
• Gucci, Salesforce, BHP, Shell, easyJet, Leon and the band Pearl Jam
were among dozens of companies and organisations that have bought
rainforest offsets approved by Verra for environmental claims.
• Human rights issues are a serious concern in at least one of the
offsetting projects. The Guardian visited a flagship project in Peru, and
was shown videos that residents said showed their homes being cut
down with chainsaws and ropes by park guards and police. They spoke
of forced evictions and tensions with park authorities.

“The investigation indicated that many claims
based on the rainforest credits, which are generated
by predicting deforestation that would have
happened in the absence of the conservation
projects, were largely meaningless, putting
organisations that buy the offsets at risk of
greenwashing. Verra heavily disputed the
findings and said it remained committed to
rainforest conservation schemes.”
“The US non-profit said it would stand by current
methods for producing rainforest offsets in the
interim even though authors of Verra’s own rules
for the carbon credits say they are flawed and open
to exploitation, potentially allowing tens of
millions of worthless carbon credits to be issued
and sold to companies in the meantime.”

Net Ecosystem Exchange is a universal metric
• Respiration of the ecosystem Reco
• Plus Gross Primary Production (GPP)

NEE = Reco + GPP
• Positive NEE values indicated emissions of CO2 from the vegetation to the atmosphere, and negative values
indicate CO2 sequestration. (The positive NEE values occurs mostly at night and is associated with Reco when
the sun isn’t catalyzing the photosynthesis reaction).
• NEE is measured by Eddy Covariance and includes soil CO2 respiration of the ecosystem (Reco) and
photosynthesis (GPP).
• It is a scientifically rigorous “gold standard” for measuring carbon sequestration within natural and urban
ecosystems.
• Carbon offsets can be purchased based on NEE measurements through a Cambridge MA based company,
Planet Alpha Corporation. This is one among several alternatives that might deliver “real” carbon emissions
reductions and co-benefits. This is part of on-going D-Lab student team is investigations. But carbon offsets

MIT’s Climate Leadership
• Given the uncertainty of the current carbon offsets market fairlures, carbon
offsets are a dubious substitute for reducing carbon emissions on MIT’s campus.
• MIT can best demonstrate its climate leadership and its dedication to its students,
our “future generations,” by supporting the BEUDO Amendment
• This is a matter of acting in THIS DECADE to reduce our own emissions to zero as
quickly as it possible, not to expect special accommodations for supposed
hardships.
• Leaders at Boston University, Cornell, Columbia and Stanford and other eminent
colleges universities have already shown the way. MIT has this responsibility to
learn from others and undertake aggressive climate action / emissions reductions
now.
• Support for the BEUDO Amendment is in line with MIT’s Climate Leadership and
is in the best interests of our students at MIT and beyond.
• We can do it!
