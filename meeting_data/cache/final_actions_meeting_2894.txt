>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT. PURSUANT TO THE
RULE, IN THE EVENT OF 20 OR MORE SPEAKERS, AMOUNT OF TIME
ALLOCATED IS TO MINUTES AND INDIVIDUALS CANNOT ALLOCATE TIME TO
OTHER SPEAKERS. I ASK YOU STATE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, AND THE ITEM
YOU SPEAK ON. CLERK WILSON, I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY PULLING UP THE

THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU.
Public Comment

>> MR. CLERK: FIRST SPEAKER FOR TONIGHT'S PUBLIC COMMENT IS JOE.
>> THEY HAVE NOT YET JOINED THE ZOOM. WE'LL START WITH LINDA. GO
AHEAD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> I'M A MEMBER OF THE PORTER SQUARE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. I
HAVE LIVED ON MASS AVENUE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE FOR TWO YEARS. AND
TWO AND HALF YEARS. AND MY QUESTION IS IN REFERENCE TO THE
CONCERNS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF 25 MATURE
STREET TREES. I WANT TO ASK HOW A PROGRESSIVE, WEALTHY AND YET
DIVERSE CITY LIKE CAMBRIDGE, SO RICH IN INTELLECTUAL FIRE POWER

Jun 1, 2020

APPARENTLY CAN TAKE FOR GRANTED THE ELIMINATION OF ROUGHLY 16
ACRES OF TREES A YEAR, WHICH HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 15 YEARS OR SO
WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO MITIGATE THE LOSS AND SUSTAIN THE CITY'S TREE
CANOPY. I'M CALLING ATTENTION TO AN EFFORT IN ROXBURY LAST YEAR
WHERE LOCAL RESIDENTS MANAGED TO STOP THE ELIMINATION OF
SOMETHING LIKE 250 TREES ALONG THE BOULEVARD. AND I'M ALSO CALLING
ATTENTION TO LAST AUGUST AGAIN, A YEAR AGO, A BIG ARTICLE IN THE
"NEW YORK TIMES," LOOKING AT CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING
BOSTON, STARTING WITH RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND LOOKING AT IMPACTS
WHAT THEY CALL ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM THAT IS ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> AND OTHER GREENERY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WANT TO SAY, VICE-MAYOR MALLON HAS JOINED FOR
THE RECORD. AND THE NEXT PERSON SIGNED UP IS JOHN.
>> MR. CLERK: I WILL PAUSE TO FIX ONE TECHNICAL ISSUE.
>> JOEL HAS SINCE JOINED. IF WE CAN CALL ON THEM NEXT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M JOEL, I LIVE IN THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD
AND I HAVE BEEN ACTIVITY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I TALK ABOUT THE
PROPOSED NAME CHANGE AND YOU HAD MAIL AND COMMENT ABOUT THIS
OVER A LONG TIME. I WANT TO SAY, HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS, THE FIRST IT
IS ESSENTIAL WE GET RID OF THE AGASSIZ NAME. IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT
AND INSULT AND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGACY. ABOUT THE PROCESS
AND YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT, IT BEGAN OVER A YEAR AND HALF AGO.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS TRUNCATED BY THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE
PANDEMIC, BUT NONETHELESS, EFFORTS MADE BY OUTREACH AND MANY
PEOPLE WERE REACHED. AS YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, THERE
ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET -- FEEL THEY DON'T GET REACHED OR
SAW THE MATERIAL OR DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.
NONETHELESS, WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CHIMED IN, THEIR VOICES SHOULD BE
HEARD, BUT THE PROCESS CERTAINLY WAS EXTENSIVE.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS TIME TO CHANGE THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAME.
AND THE PROCESS LED TO AN OVERWHELMING SUPPORT TO CHANGE IT TO
MARIA BALDWIN AND SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT WHAT ABOUT
THIS PERSON AND THAT PERSON. WELL, SHE HAD A LONG AND VERY
DISTINGUISHED ASSOCIATION WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD, NONE OF WHICH
WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES.
FURTHERMORE, IT NAMES THE NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER A WOMAN AND
NAMES A NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER A PERSON OF COLOR. SO, WHEN YOU
COMBINE THOSE FACTORS WITH HER DISTINGUISHED HISTORY HERE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, IT CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT NAMING IT AFTER MARIA
BALDWIN IS A WONDERFUL THING TO DO. I THINK A TRIBUTE TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, A TRIBUTE TO THE CITY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR
ATTENTION. THAT'S IT. BYE.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON JEN?
>> WE HAVE TOM. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> I'M TOM AND JILL IS NEXT TO ME. WE LIVED IN HERE SINCE 2007 AND ON
THE HARVARD FACULTY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS AND WENT TO COLLEGE
THERE AND HEARD THE AGASSIZ FOREVER. AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO
SUGGEST THAT WE LIKE TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH WE CAN
TAKE PRIDE IN THE NAME AND WE LIKE THE IDEA OF BALDWIN. I'D LIKE TO
ECHO WHAT MR. BARD SAID AND MAKE FEW OTHER POINTS. I'M A SOCIAL
SCIENTIST IN THE HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCHER AND I WATCH THIS PROCESS
AS I HAVE MANY IN WHICH WE COME TO CONCLUSIONS.
IT WAS CARING, IT WAS FRIENDLY AND RESPECTFUL, AND AS FAR AS I CAN
SEE, IT RESULTED IN A VERY CLEAR CONSENSUS THAT THE NAME SHOULD
CHANGE AND THAT THE NAME SHOULD CHANGE TO THE BALDWIN
NEIGHBORHOOD.
AS ALWAYS, THE PROCESSES ARE ALSO IMPERFECT. WE DID A SURVEY THAT
WAS IMPERFECT. IT WAS NOT PRESENTED BRILLIANTLY, TOO MANY NAMES
IN IT BECAUSE ONE PERSON PUT A LOT OF NAMES INTO IT AND THEY
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. IT WAS A PIECE OF THE EVIDENCE AND IT
ADDED TO A CONSENSUS THAT WAS CLEAR. THERE'S A SUGGESTION MADE
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RANK-CHOICE ELECTION OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT GOING TO AND I'D LIKE TO SAY SIMPLY, I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS
SUGGESTION. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS, MAJORITY OF
RESPONDENTS AND MAJORITY CAME UP FOR CHANGE AND THE BALDWIN
NAME. YOU LOOK AT RANK-CHOICE ELECTIONS AS THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
POINTED OUT WITH THE ADAMS PRIMARY ELECTION, THE PERSON IN THE
LEAD IN A RANK-CHOICE ELECTION VIRTUALLY ALWAYS WINS. NO NEED TO
DO MORE.
NAMES CHANGE. I WAS TOMMY, THEN THOMAS, AND NOW I'M TOM. AND
THERE ARE MANY GOOD REASONS FOR CHANGE AND NONE AGAINST AND WE
ARE FIRMLY IN FAVOR OF CHANGING IT TO BALDWIN.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, WE HAVE
SARAH BOYER. TO REMIND YOU, TWO MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY. PLEASE
STATE THE ITEM THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING ON.
>> HI, I'M SARAH BOYER, LIVE ON ANTREM STREET AND SPEAK ABOUT THE
TREES THAT -- THE TREES AT THE TOBIN SCHOOL AND AT JEFFERSON PARK
THAT THE CITY IS THINKING OF KILLING.
AS TREES GROW THEY HELP STOP CLIMATE CHANGE BY REMOVING CARBON
DIOXIDE FROM THE AIR AND RELEASING OXYGEN INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I LOVE MY STREET, ANTREM STREET IN INMAN
SQUARE. THE WHOLE STREET IS SIDED BY TREES, WHICH GIVE US SHADE ON
HOT DAYS, PROVIDE HOMES FOR BIRDS, SQUIRRELS, AND OTHER CRITTERS,
AND BRING US BEAUTY IN ALL SEASONS. DURING THE PANDEMIC, WHAT
SAVED ME WAS BEING IN THE WOODS, HIKING IN A FOREST, AND SEEING
HOW ALL LIVING THINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER.


PAGE 3

Aug 2 2021

LOW-INCOME PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TAKING THE BRUNT OF THE COLLECTIVE
IRRESPONSIBILITY TO THE PLANET. IN THIS CASE, PEOPLE WHO LIVE AT
JEFFERSON PARK. IF THIS WAS HAPPENING IN WEST CAMBRIDGE, PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE STOPPED THIS FROM EVER BEING DEBATED. WE MUST STOP
KILLING OUR TREES. NEW TREES CAN BE PLANTED, BUT THEY TAKE YEARS TO
GROW TO FULL MATURITY. WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME ANYMORE.
THIS IS SOMETHING, ONE THING, THAT MUST BE SAVED, OUR TREES FOR OUR
CHILDREN AND GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ANN MCGOVERN MACADAM.
>> THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CITY MANAGER'S
AGENDA ITEM TWO. REGARDING THE LANDMARK DESIGNATION
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ALBERTA SCOTT HOUSE AT 28 UNION STREET.
AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE DESIGNATION OF THE ALBERTA
SCOTT HOUSE AS A CAMBRIDGE LANDMARK. I AGREE WITH THE HISTORICAL
COMMISSION DESIGNATION REPORT AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
LANDMARK DESIGNATION BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS WITH
ALBERTA SCOTT, WHO IS THE FIRST BLACK GRADUATE -- DURING THE
RESIDENCE IN THE HOME AND FOR THE IMPORTANT ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE
WOODS AND PAYNES FAMILY DURING THE POST CIVIL WAR PERIOD. TWO
OTHER BLACK FAMILIES AND THE ARCHITECTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
HOUSE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION DURING THE
EARLY INDUSTRIALIZATION PERIOD OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALSO
JUSTIFIES THE LANDMARK DESIGNATION FOR ITS ARCHITECTURE. AND I JUST
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE YOU WILL DESIGNATE
THIS SPECIAL PROPERTY A CAMBRIDGE LANDMARK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT COUNCILLOR TOOMEY IS
HERE FOR THE RECORD. NEXT PERSON I HAVE ON HERE IS SUZANN.
>> SHE HAS NOT JOINED. NEXT PERSON ON THE CALL IS JONATHAN HARRIS.
GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HI, JONATHAN. GO AHEAD.
>> YES, I'M TESTIFYING ON POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6. I'M JONATHAN HARRIS,
9 MARIE AVENUE IN THE INMAN AREA. I'M A SEARCH RESEARCHER IN TUFTS
WHERE WE HAVE ONGOING RESEARCH ON FOREST AND BIOMASS.
RESEARCHERS FROM THE INSTITUTE HAVE PRESENTED FINDINGS ON THE
IMPORTANCE OF MATURE TREES TO THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF
ENERGY RESOURCES, MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AS
WELL AS TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN
EUROPE. THE PRIMARY CONCLUSION FROM THE STUDIES CONCERNS THE
VALUE OF MATURE TREES AND MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT WHEN MATURE
TREES ARE CUT THE DAMAGE CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR BY REPLANTING -AND TREES ARE RENEWABLE RESOURCE AND THE TRUTH IS NOT SIMPLE. A
PROJECT THAT REMOVES A TREE 18 INCHES DIAMETER AND REPLACE IT WITH
A SMALLER TREE, FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER, WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY
ECOLOGICAL LOSS. THE STANDING TREE IS ABOUT 64 TIMES AS MUCH

PAGE 4

Aug 2 2021

BIOMASS AS THE SMALLER ONE AND STORE ABOUT 16 TIMES AS MUSH
CARBON ANNUALLY AND IN THE URBAN AREA, THE LOGIC APPLIES TO
CANOPY, SHADE, AND HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION BENEFITS. THERE'S NO
PROCESS FOR RECORDING THE MATURE TREES THE VALUE THEY DESERVE IN
PROJECT PLANNING IN CAMBRIDGE. A TREE IS LIABLE TO BE IN THE WAY OF
AN IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND THEREFORE MUST BE REMOVED. THIS IS
THE CASE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, INMAN SQUARE AND AT THE TOBIN
SCHOOL, JEFFERSON PARK, AND KENDALL SQUARE. DEEPLY FELT OPPOSITION
TO THE TREE REMOVAL IS OVERWRITTEN. I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER NUMBER
6 TO TREAT TREES AS ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M CONCERNED
THAT IT MAY BE TOO VAGUE GIVEN THE DETERMINATION BY THE CITY
MANAGER'S OFFICE TO IGNORE THE VALUE OF TREES IN THE DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON WHO I HAVE -- ACTUALLY. NAOMI, YOU
CAN DO IT BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLY NOT A SIMILAR LIST.
>> I COULDN'T UNMUTE. NEXT. WE HAVE DEB.
>> GO AHEAD. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK. MY DAUGHTER, JACKIE,
IS ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS OF FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. A PROGRAM FOR
YOU'RE YOUTH IN CAMBRIDGE. WORKS THREE OTHER CO-FOUNDERS AND
EDUCATORS. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE PROVIDES POSITIVE AND SAFE SPACES FOR
SCHOLARS TO INTERACT WITH PEERS AND PARTAKE AND LEARN A VARIETY OF
THINGS. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE PROGRAM IS CREATED AND DEDICATED TO
PROVIDING POSITIVE MENTORSHIP TO SCHOLARS, WHILE DISMANTLING
WHITE SUPREMACY CULTURE AND DISENFRANCHISES THE BLACK AND
BROWN YOUTH. SCHOLARS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ATTEND
FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. WORKSHOPS INCLUDE FINANCIAL LITERACY,
ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SOCIAL JUSTICE EDUCATION, COMMUNITY RELATIONS,
HEALTH, WELLNESS, AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT, WITH THE INTENTION OF
DIMINISHING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE IS A POSITIVE
IMPACT FOR THE SCHOLARS IN THE CITY AS WELL AS MY DAUGHTER, JACKIE,
WILL, DEBBIE, AND KINNEY, THEY PUT WORK INTO IT AND I REALLY WISH AND
HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ALLOWING THEM GRANT MONEY FOR THE
PROGRAM. THEY CAN CONTINUE THEIR VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> NEXT WE HAVE OBI. IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, PLEASE GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF FUNDING FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE,
POLICY ORDER 195. AND AS A MENTOR, I HAVE SEEN CHILDREN WHO MAY
HAVE NOT KNOWN EACH OTHER PREVIOUSLY CONNECT AND FORM
FRIENDSHIPS. IT IS ALSO AFFORDED ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
CHILDREN FROM OTHER SCHOOLS, CHILDREN HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO GO,
WHICH KEEPS THEM OFF THE STREETS. PARENTS CAN FEEL A SENSE OF
SECURITY KNOWING THEIR KIDS ARE IN A SUPPORTIVE ATMOSPHERE. I KNOW
FIRST-HAND WHAT A POSITIVE INFLUENCE IT HAS HAD ON OUR CHILDREN.
SO, AGAIN I'M IN SUPPORT OF FUNDING POLICY ORDER 159 AND I HOPE THE

PAGE 5

Aug 2 2021

CITY COUNCIL WILL PASS THE MOTION TO FUND FNH. THANK YOU FOR
LISTENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> SORRY FOR THAT PAUSE. NEXT, WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER. GO AHEAD, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M CHRISTOPHER, 17 LAUREL STREET AND
COMMENT ON THREE ITEMS. FIRST, I WILL COMMENT ON CITY MANAGER
AGENDA ITEM 2. IT IS ON LANDMARKING OF UNION STREET. I THINK
LANDMARKING A PROPERTY IS A VALUABLE THING IN CAMBRIDGE. I THINK IT
OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK IT OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES WHEN WE
CAN USE THEM AS PUBLIC GOOD. I THINK THAT LANDMARKING OWNED
HOUSES BECAUSE THEY MEET CRITERIA THAT APPLY TO 75% OF THE HOUSES
IN CAMBRIDGE IS NOT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND COULD BE HARMFUL. I
ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT LANDMARKING OF THIS PROPERTY IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES WE HAVE FOR CAMBRIDGE AND PUBLIC
GOOD AND THINK ABOUT THAT ELEMENT.
AND SECOND THING I WILL COMMENT ON, POLICY ORDER 2, I BELIEVE, ON
E-BIKES. IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD ALREADY, I THINK THEY ARE SUPER
VALUABLE AND CAN REPLACE THOUSANDS OF VEHICLE MILES OF CAR TRIPS IN
CAMBRIDGE EVERY YEAR. I HAVE ONE, GOT IT THREE MONTHS AGO AND
HAVE RIDDEN MORE THAN 650 MILES ON. GREAT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
AND WE HAVE TO PASS STATE LEGISLATION TO LEGALIZE THEM BECAUSE
THEY ARE IN A WEIRD LEGAL STATE RIGHT NOW. THIRD THING, I WANT TO
COMMENT ON TREES. TREES ARE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T THINK
ANYONE IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATION, IN THE CITY, QUESTIONS THAT. SO
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE'S A LOT OF IT. WE ARE IN A SITUATION
WHERE WE DEAL WITH ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE, FLOODING, WE DEAL
WITH ALL KINDS OF CHARACTERISTICS, LOOK AT THE TOBIN SCHOOL, ONE
CONCERN THAT LED TO THE REMOVAL OF MATURE TREES WAS THAT -- THEY
NEED TO INSTALL A WATER STORAGE TANK BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE IS
INCREASING FLOODING. THE AMOUNT OF TREES WE KEEP IS TINY IN
PROPORTION TO THE POSITIVE BENEFITS. THESE ARE NOT THINGS WE HAVE
TO HOLD IN COMPETITION. WE HAVE TO DO ALL THE THINGS TO THE BEST OF
OUR ABILITY AND KEEP THEM IN ACCOUNT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANKS.
>> NEXT PERSON ON THIS LIST IS NOT IN THE ZOOM.
>> NEXT WE HAVE MIA. UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE
CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL. I'M MAYA, IN THE BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND I STARTED THE INITIATIVE TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, A TEAM OF CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY DEVELOPERS AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL MEMBERS
AND RESIDENTS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO ENGAGE IN A THOUGHTFUL,
THOROUGH, AND EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. WE CREATED ONLINE CONTEXT,


PAGE 6

Aug 2 2021

ENCYCLOPEDIAS, FILLED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE LEGACIES OF BALDWIN AND AGASSIZ. GAVE
EXAMPLE OF OTHERS, LIKE THE PORT, THAT CHANGED THEIR NAMES AND
MORE. WE SENT FLYERS TO 98% OF THE HOUSES AND INFORMING THEM OF
A CITY-WIDE SURVEY AND THAT RECEIVED OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR
THE BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD. IT WAS FOLLOWED BY OTHER VARIANTS OF
THE NAME.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND CITY HAVE SPOKEN. IT IS TIME TO MAKE
IMPORTANT HISTORY AND CHANGE THIS NAME IN HONOR OF MARIA
BALDWIN. TO THE PEOPLE THAT HATE TO SEE THE AGASSIZ GO, THERE ARE
TOWNS, STREETS, GLACIERS, ET CETERA, NAMED AFTER HIM AND AS A
HARVARD STUDENT, I CAN TELL THERE'S A LOT OF HIM ON CAMPUS. HISTORY
CAN NEVER CHANGE, IN A COUNTRY BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF WHITE
SUPREMACY, WE HAVE TO BE CRITICAL ABOUT WHAT AND WHO DESERVE TO
REPRESENT THE SHARED CURRENT VALUES. WE LIVE IN A DIVERSE
COMMUNITY, REALITY THAT AGASSIZ FOUGHT HARD AGAINST. THE SAME
COMMUNITY THAT BALDWIN WORKED HARD FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME AND LET'S CHANGE THIS NAME. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE KATE FRANK. IF YOU
CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. KATE FRANK, UNMUTE
YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> NOW AM I ON?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY. IT STILL SAYS MAYA'S NAME. I'M HONORED, BUT I'M DEFINITELY
NOT MAYA. ANYWAY, I'M KATE FRANK, I LIVE AT 53 CRESCENT STREET AND
LIVED IN THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD SINCE 1972. I HAD A BRIEF START IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN 1960 IN FURNISHED HOUSING. I'M HERE TONIGHT
REPRESENTING MYSELF, BUT ALSO THE COMMITTEE THAT HAS MET MAYA
AND SEVERAL OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE REFERRED TO. I DON'T WANT TO
DUPLICATE WHAT THEY ALREADY SAID. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A VERY
DIFFICULT PROCESS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC.
THE KIND OF ENGAGEMENT WE PREFERRED WOULD HAVE CALLED FOR
FACE-TO-FACE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS LIKE DOOR KNOCKING OR GROUP
GATHERINGS, WHICH AFTER THE INITIAL FIRST MEETING, WE WERE NOT ABLE
TO HAVE. AND THAT WAS LIKE A STONE ON OUR PROCESS. WE DID WHAT
WE COULD UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE NOT AS FAVORABLE AS WE'D
LIKE.
IT IS NOT REALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT MENTIONING THAT BECAUSE THINK
THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF PEOPLE OPPOSING IF YOU WERE TO INQUIRE ON
AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, IT'S THAT I THINK QUITE THE OPPOSITE. I THINK IT IS A
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS PROUD OF WANTING TO WELCOME DIVERSE
GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE ARE, HOWEVER, ARE UNAWARE THERE IS
A SYSTEMIC IMPACT OF RACISM THAT IS RETAINED WHEN YOU RETAIN A
NAME ONCE YOU KNOW BETTER. THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A RACIST WAY
OF THINKING. IT IS HARD TO EXPRESS HOW STRONG LY I FEEL ABOUT THE

PAGE 7

Aug 2 2021

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF HOW WE USE ZONING ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY.
>> OKAY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS JAMES NEXT.
>> YES. GO AHEAD.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M JAMES, ATTORNEY WITH OFFICE AT 675
MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ITEM THREE UNDER
APPLICATIONS AND PETITIONS. THE CURB-CUT APPLICATION FOR THE
REAGAN INSTITUTE. IT IS 624 MAIN STREET, BUT THE PROPOSED CURB-CUTS
ARE ON ALBANY STREET. THE STREET AS FRONTAGE ON PORTLAND, MAIN
AND ALBANY, THEY WERE REVIEWED EXTENSIVELY. AND WE ARE SELECTED
TO ACCOMMODATE VEHICLE ACCESS INTO THE NEW UNDERGROUND
PARKING GARAGE AND THE LOADING DOCK.
YOU MAY BE AWARE THE REAGAN INSTITUTE IS A NONPROFIT SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND MIT. IT
IS FUNDED BY PHILANTHROPY, AND THE MISSION IS FOCUSSED ON THE
TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE AROUND THE WORLD. THE SPECIAL
PERMIT IS CONCLUDED, REAGAN IS PURSUING AN APPLICATION FOR
BUILDING PERMIT. APPROVAL OF THE CURB-CUT APPLICATIONS IS A
REQUIRED COMPONENT OF THE BUILDING PERMIT PROCESS. WE REQUEST A
TIMELY ACTION ON THE APPLICATION IN ORDER THAT THE CONSTRUCTION
SCHEDULE CAN BE MAINTAINED AND THE PERFECT WORK OF THE INSTITUTE
CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. UP NEXT, WE HAVE HIBA EDDAIF.
>> HELLO. I'M AT 154 PROSPECT STREET. HI, MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND
HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE
CAMBRIDGE YOUTH COUNCIL AND IN SUPPORT OF EVERYBODY SPEAKING FOR
CHARTER RIGHT TWO. AND WE THE COUNCIL SUPPORT THIS NAME CHANGE
-- SORRY. FOR THE RECORD, CHARTER RIGHT 2, NOT POLICY ORDER 150 THAT
I SPEAK ON. AND TO CHANGE THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAME IN HONOR OF
MARIE BALDWIN. WE DON'T CONDONE THE PROPAGATION OF THE AGASSIZ
NAME AND THE DISCRIMINATORY HISTORY IT HOLDS. THE CAMBRIDGE
YOUTH COUNCIL AND THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS INDEBTED TO MARIA
BALDWIN, PRINCIPAL, EDUCATOR, AND A PROUD PART OF THE CITY'S
HISTORY, WHO DOESN'T ONLY REPRESENT -- SORRY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: EXCUSE ME. GO AHEAD.
>> DOESN'T ONLY REPRESENT THE CITY STRIVES TO BE, BUT CREATED AND
CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMUNITY IN A WAY FEW HAVE, LEAST OF ALL
AGASSIZ. THE COUNCIL AND YOUNG PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE, WE SERVE TO
REPRESENT SUPPORT THE WORK OF MS. COUNTER AND THOSE BEFORE HER
THAT WORK TO RID THE CITY OF AGASSIZ NAME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TIME AND CONSIDERATION. WE HOPE YOU LOOK FAVORABLE UPON


PAGE 8

Aug 2 2021

CHARTER RIGHT TWO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK FRED ->> FRED HAS NOT JOINED. CANDY, GO AHEAD.
>> YES. I'M CANDY. 18 RICE STREET IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE. A STREET THAT
HAS A LOT OF TREES AND THE CITY HAS RECENTLY ADDED MORE. AND IT IS
JUST A WONDERFUL THING TO HAVE TREES ON YOUR STREET AS WE ALL
KNOW. SO, I'M CLEARLY SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER... IS IT 6?
ABOUT THE TREES. I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER. I THINK
THAT RETAINING MATURE HEALTHY TREES MUST BE A PRIORITY, NOT AN
AFTERTHOUGHT. AND I READ SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THAT THE TREES ARE
ALREADY -- THEY HAVE STARTED TO REMOVE TREES AT TOBIN. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE TIMELINES ARE, BUT IF THAT IS THE CASE, WILL THAT BE PAUSED
UNTIL THIS IS -- THIS POLICY ORDER IS DETERMINED? OR WILL THEY BE
GRANDFATHERED? CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND DITTO WITH JEFFERSON
PARK.
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS LIKE WHY REMOVING 144 TREES, GOOD
DESIGN, IF THESE ARE FORWARD-THINKING, AWARE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE
PRACTICING THIS PROFESSION TODAY, THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT GOOD
DESIGN WORKS WITH EXISTING TREES. IT DOESN'T CLEAR THEM AWAY FOR
EXPEDIENCY OR TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GET A BIG TRUCK ON SITE. VERY
SHORT-SIGHTED THINKING.
DEVELOPERS AND ARCHITECTS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TREES FURTHER
UPSTREAM IN THE PROCESS AS ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS
POLICY ORDER WILL FORCE THEM TO DO THAT. AND THE COUNCIL NEEDS TO
BE GOOD ANCESTORS AND PROTECT THE TREE CANOPY THAT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO OUR QUALITY OF LIFE TODAY AND TO GENERATIONS TO
COME. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS ANN-CHARLOTTE NEXT?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME. HI. GOOD EVENING. I LIVE ON 10 SACRAMENTO
STREET AND SPEAKING ON THE PROPOSED AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD
CHANGE. I'M HOPEFUL YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED,
ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MATTER WAS TABLED FOR A MONTH TO NOW VOTE
IN FAVOR OF RENAMING THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD, THE BALDWIN
NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS A VOTE THAT CARRIES A GREAT DEAL OF
SIGNIFICANCE. I THINK ONE THAT WILL BE ESPECIALLY REMEMBERED. YOUR
VOTE TODAY WILL OFFICIALLY ESTABLISH A NEIGHBORHOOD NAME AFTER
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EDUCATORS OF HER ERA. EDUCATOR, IF SHE
DID EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID 100 YEARS AGO TODAY, WOULD BE APPRECIATED
FOR HER VALUES AND COMMITMENT TO EDUCATING CHILDREN OF ALL RACES
AND BACKGROUNDS.
100 YEARS LATER, MOST OF US DON'T SHARE AGASSIZ'S VALUES. IF HE DID
WHAT HE DID 100 YEARS AGO TODAY, HE WOULDN'T TEACH AT HARVARD OR
ANY UNIVERSITY. THE EVIL WHITE supremacy LIVES ON IN THE COUNTRY AND
THAT IS A MUCH GREATER PROBLEM AND ONE THAT IS A LOT HARDER TO GET


PAGE 9

Aug 2 2021

RID OF THAN REMOVING HIS NAME FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK
YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JOHN, FOLLOWED BY JACKIE
MURPHY.
>> JOHN, YOU DO HAVE THE FLOOR. PLEASE DIAL STAR 6 TO UNMUTE.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I'M JOHN, I SPEAK
ABOUT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6. I'M IN FAVOR, WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER.
ONE PROBLEM IN CAMBRIDGE IS -- OUR PROBLEM IN CAMBRIDGE IS AREN'T
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SAVE THE TREES, WE DON'T RECOGNIZE WHAT
THEY NEED TO THRIVE. I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS IN OP-ED CURRENTLY
UP IN CAMBRIDGE DAY. ONE GENERAL MISUNDERSTANDING IS THAT TREES
ARE SOLITARY BEINGS, THEY DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN, INDEPENDENTLY.
A WORK OF FOREST SCIENTIST S, IT SHOWS THAT TREES COMMUNICATE AND
SHARED RESOURCES THROUGH THE ROOTS AND AIR AND LARGE TREES,
NURTURE SMALL ONES AND SMALL ONES DEPEND ON LARGE ONES TO REACH
POTENTIAL. THIS NEW SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING MEANS THAT OUR
POLICY OF REPLACING LARGE TREES WITH GREATER NUMBERS OF SMALL
TREES IS AS MISGUIDED AS THE POLICY OF REPLACING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
TEACHERS WITH GREATER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WITH THE HOPE THEY
DEVELOP INTO TEACHERS. THEY CAN'T REPLACE THEM. CAMBRIDGE'S TREES
NEED OUR HELP. WE NEED TO SEE THEM AS A SYSTEM, A COMMUNITY IN
WHICH THE OLD TREES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AND WE HAVE TO VALUE THE
MOTHER TREES MORE HIGHLY THAN WE DO. THE SYSTEM CAN BREAK DOWN
WITHOUT THEM. IT SEEMS TO BE.
IN SPRING LAST YEAR, CAMBRIDGE HEEDED SCIENCE AND PAUSED ALL
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE SHOULD NOW BE
WILLING TO HEED THE SCIENCE, PAUSE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT THE
TOBIN SCHOOL, JEFFERSON -- THE PLAN FOR REMOVAL ARE IRREPLACEABLE.
IT IS A TREE EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT AS SUCH. THANK
YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JACKIE MURPHY, YOU ARE NEXT.
>> JACKIE, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI, JACKIE MURPHY. ONE OF THE CO-FOUNDERS OF FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE.
IN JANUARY OF 2020, THE FOUR OF US SAT A TABLE AND CREATED FRIDAY
NIGHT HYPE AND LAUNCHED IN 27 DAYS. THE SCHOLARS ARE EXCITED AND
WE KNEW IN THE MOMENT WE HAD CREATED SOMETHING POWER. AND
MAGICAL. SINCE JANUARY, THE PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO GROW AND
EXPAND. DURING THE PANDEMIC, IN REMOTE LEARNING, WE WERE ABLE TO
PROVIDE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE... IN A DIGITAL FORMAT VIA ZOOM. LAST
SUMMER WE HELD TWO-MORE THAN EVENTS SOCIALLY DISTANCE IN
COLLABORATION WITH COMMISSIONER BARD. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE PROVIDES
A SAFE SPACE FOR -- (INAUDIBLE). PARTAKE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT
ACTIVITIES. THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE PROGRAM IS CREATED AND DEDICATED
TO PROVIDE POSITIVE MONITORSHIPS AND DISMANTLING... (INAUDIBLE).


PAGE 10

Aug 2 2021

CURRENTLY THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT
WHAT PROGRAM AND INTERVENTIONS WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR
SCHOLARS IN THE CITY. THERE IS NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL WHEN
THE PROGRAM EXISTS AND THAT PROGRAM IS FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. OUR
TEAM NEEDS THE SUPPORT FOR RESOURCES AND FUNDING. WE CONTINUE
TO CALL... A MILLION DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE EVENTS HAPPEN, CALLING
FAVOR TO FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ALL OF US HAVE PUT IN
HUNDREDS OF OUR DOLLARS TO KEEP THE PROGRAM AFLOAT, WHILE LONG
HOURS FOR FREE. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE, THE TEAM, SCHOLARS, AND MENTORS
NEED THE FUNDING FROM THE CITY TO KEEP THIS PROGRAM AS STRONG AS
IT IS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE OLIVIA COUNTER.
>> HI, MAYOR SIDDIQUI. I SPEAK ON CHARTER RIGHT 2. I WAS NINE YEARS
OLD WHEN MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHANGED FROM AGASSIZ TO BALDWIN.
AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY... I'M IN FAVOR AND I HOPE YOU ALL
VOTE TO PASS RENAMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO BALDWIN, IT MAKES
SENSE BECAUSE THIS IS THE NAME OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND
HONORS THE LEGACY OF MS. BALDWIN, THE CONNECTION TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY. CHAMPION FOR WOMEN AND
ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK WOMEN. AGASSIZ MADE GREAT SCIENTIFIC STRIDES
AND LIKEWISE PERPETUATED HARMFUL AND RACIST IDEOLOGIES THAT HAVE
IMPLICATIONS TODAY AS ONE OF THE FEW BLACK RESIDENTS, IT SICKENS ME
TO HEAR ANY SUPPORT OF THE MAN WHO IS DISGUSTED BY PEOPLE THAT
LOOK LIKE ME OR MY FAMILY. WE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
TO SCIENCE AND HOLD THE LEGACY ACCOUNTABLE. I DON'T BELIEVE THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OUTWEIGH THE DISGUSTING VIEWS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.
THE COMMUNITY WOULD NEVER HOLD SOMEONE LIKE HIM IN HIGH REGARD
TODAY. HIS NAME AND LEGACY DO NOT SERVE TO REPRESENT OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT SPEAKER IS KEN REEVES.
>> YES, GOOD EVENING TO MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND THE COUNCIL. I HAVE
COME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CAMBRIDGE BRANCH OF THE NAACP.
REALLY TO SHARE WITH THE CITIZENS OUR COMBINED GRIEVE AT THE DEATH
OF ROBERT MOSES. AND THE CAMBRIDGE BRANCH HAS PREPARED A TRIBUTE
TO HIS LIFE AND LEGACY. AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER AND A LEADER IN
EDUCATION AND CAMBRIDGE CITIZENS, WE THE MEMBERS OF THE
CAMBRIDGE BRANCH MOURN THE LOSS OF BOB MOSES, WHO TRANSITION
FROM THIS LIFE ON SUNDAY, JULY 25, 2021. A CIVIL RIGHTS GIANT IN OUR
MIDST AND A CHAMPION FOR QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL AMERICAN
CHILDREN.
BORN IN HARLEM, NEW YORK, IN 1935, SPENT SIGNIFICANT LAST HALF OF THE
LIFE AS A CITIZEN ACTIVIST HEADQUARTERED IN CAMBRIDGE. MOSES WAS
AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY ORGANIZER, HE WAS SMART, HE WAS KIND, HE
WAS HUMBLE, HE WAS SERIOUS, AS A HUMANITARIAN AND A MAN WAY
AHEAD OF HIS TIME. A WONDERFUL SPOUSE TO HIS WIFE, DEVOTE FATHER
TO HIS CHILDREN, AND DEVOTED GRANDFATHER TO HIS SEVEN

GRANDCHILDREN.
BOB AND JANET MOSES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE ATTENDEES AT MANY CAMBRIDGE
NAACP EVENTS OVER THE YEARS AND HAVE FULLY ENGAGED CITIZENS
STRIVING TO MAKE CAMBRIDGE LIVE UP TO ITS HIGHEST POTENTIAL AND
PROMISE. BOB AND JANET ESTABLISHED THE ALGEBRA PROJECT IN
CAMBRIDGE, IT GREW FROM BOB'S VOLUNTEER TEACHING AT THE DR.
MARTIN LUTHER KING SCHOOL AND GREW OUT OF THE RECEIPT OF A GRANT.
BOB WAS COURAGEOUS AND ENDURED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND JAILED
DURING THE EARLY CIVIL RIGHTS WORK. HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE
STUDENT ON VIOLENT -- AND AN ORGANIZER OF THE 1964 FREEDOM
SUMMER, WHICH BROUGHT NORTHERN COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ASSIST WITH
VOTER REGISTRATION IN MISSISSIPPI. HE STUDIED AT HARVARD LATER. AND
AS I MENTIONED, FOUNDED THE ALGEBRA PROJECT. THOSE WHO KNEW HIM
BEST IT EMPATHIZE HIS UNUSUAL -- THE UNUSUAL STYLE OF LEADERSHIP AS
THE ORGANIZER WHO DECRIED LEADERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MAYOR? I APOLOGIZE. CLERK ADVISE ME TO
ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- I SEE A HAND. THERE'S AN ECHO.
>> I MOVE TO SUSPEND THE RULES. I WAS TRYING TO GET A MESSAGE TO
YOU TO ALLOW FORMER MAYOR KEN REEVES TO FINISH HIS REMARKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW? CLERK, ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO ALLOW FORMER
MAYOR KEN REEVES TO CONCLUDE -- ALLOW HIM TIME TO CONCLUDE
PUBLIC COMMENTS. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.

Councillor Simmons Motion to
allow former Mayor Kenneth
Reeves to finish his public
comment

>> I THANK YOU, COUNCILLORS AND MAYOR. THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST
-- AN ORGANIZER WHO DECRIED LEADERSHIPS. HE OFTEN TOOK HIS PLACE AT
THE BACK OF THE ROOM AT NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS IN THE PORT IN
CAMBRIDGE. HE WAS A MAN OF THE PEOPLE AND HE WANTED TO HEAR AND
SEE THE PLIGHT OF THE DISENFRANCHISED BY CLOSE OBSERVATION AND
DEEP LISTENING. OFTEN CHARACTERIZED AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER... AND
THE PEER OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR, BOB MOSES HAD A UNIQUE
APPROACH TO ADVOCACY, WHICH EMPHASIS RESULTS FIRST AND FOREMOST.
CAMBRIDGE HAS HAD AND MANY FORMIDABLE CITIZENS, BUT BOB MOSES
WAS IN A CLASS OF HIS OWN. STRONG, RESOLUTE, PRAGMATIC, LOVING,
AND SORELY MISSED. REST IN PEACE BOB MOSES. THANK THE CITY FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO LAY UPON THE RECORDS OF THE CITY THESE WORDS ON
THIS VERY SAD OCCASION. AND TO SAY THAT -- I WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO
JANET MOSES EARLIER THIS WEEK. SHE KNOWS THE CITY IS WITH HER AND
THE FAMILY AT THIS MOST DIFFICULT TIME.
I DO WANT TO SAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF NAACP, ON THE TOPIC OF
RENAMING THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD, MARIA BALDWIN AND THE NAME
IS PRONOUNCE ED -- THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRINCIPAL AS A
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOL AND WHITE FACULTY IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND WILLIAM DUBOIS, THE FOUNDER OF THE NAACP WAS THE EDITOR OF
THE CRISIS MAGAZINE, WHICH IN 1918, HAD ON THE COVER THE PICTURE OF


PAGE 12

Aug 2 2021

MARIA BALDWIN TO HERALD THIS FACT. MARIA BALDWIN HAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF CAMBRIDGE AND IN THE HISTORY
OF AMERICA. I DO WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT HER BROTHER SERVED AS AN
ELECTED MEMBER OF CAMBRIDGE CITY GOVERNMENT. SO, IT IS A GOOD
NAME, THIS BALDWIN NAME, FOR CAMBRIDGE AND FOR THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, I SEE HEATHER HOFFMAN.
>> HELLO. HEATHER HOFFMAN, 213 HURLEY STREET. SPEAK YOU FROM THE
RALLY YOU OUGHT TO BE AT, WHERE WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE CITY CAN
TREAT ALL THE RESIDENTS BETTER. I'M SORRY YOU ARE NOT THERE.
I WANT TO SPEAK FOR ONE MOMENT ABOUT BOB MOSES. I DIDN'T KNOW
HIM. I READ HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHERE HE CONNECTED HIS CIVIL RIGHTS
WORK AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALGEBRA PROJECT AND HOW THE
TWO WERE INTERTWINED. IT MAKES ME VERY SAD THAT THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE HAS PRETTY MUCH DISDAINED THE ALGEBRA PROJECT. IT
WOULD BE A GREAT TRIBUTE TO HIM IF WE EMBRACED IT AND ITS IDEALS.
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TREES. AS I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE VARIOUS
ELOQUENT SPEAKERS AT THE RALLIES, IT HAS BECOME VERY CLEAR TO ME
THAT ONE OF THE MESSAGES THAT WE SEND TO POOR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY
POOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, WE DON'T MUCH CARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE
THEY DON'T GET BEAUTIFUL PLACES TO BE. THEY GET ASPHALT. A WHOLE
LOT OF ASPHALT. BUSY STREETS. AND I THINK WE OWE THEM BETTER. THEY
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CHERISH THEM JUST AS WE MUCH CHERISH
PEOPLE IN EVERY OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD. LISTENING TO A RESIDENT OF
RINDGE TOWERS TALKING ABOUT HOW LITTLE GREENERY THERE IS AROUND
WHERE SHE LIVES. AND YET, THE CITY COULD CHANGE THAT. THE CITY
COULD PUT TREES RIGHT UP FRONT WHEN ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, SASKIA
JAMES?
>> HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> HI. I SPEAK TONIGHT IN REGARDS TO POLICY 141 AND 166. THE
REPARATIONS FUND THAT WAS PUT FORTH BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND
COUNCILLOR NOLAN. AND ALSO THE WAR ON DRUGS PROPOSAL POSITIONED
FORTH BY COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. AND I WANT TO SPEAK IN REGARD TO
ASK FOR MORE TIME AND FOR A VOTE ON THIS TO BE TABLE UNTIL
SEPTEMBER SO THAT MORE COMMUNITY INPUT FROM RESIDENTS CAN BE
GATHERED AND POSITIONED BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL -- BEFORE YOU HAVE
A VOTE SO INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS LANGUAGE WITHIN
THE POLICIES THAT REFLECT ONE OF HISTORICAL RECKONING. TO INCLUDE
LANGUAGE THAT WILL RECOGNIZE CAMBRIDGE'S ROLE IN SLAVERY AND
WHAT DOES REPARATIONS MEAN WITHOUT HISTORICAL RECKONING AND
WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CAMBRIDGE'S ROLE IN THAT, INCLUDING
EXAMINATIONS WITH COLLEGES HERE, THE USE OF SLAVE LABOR, THE


PAGE 13

Aug 2 2021

PUSHING OUT OF PEOPLE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN DESCENT, AS PROPERTIES
WERE DONE OVER, SUCH AS DANEHY PARK, WHICH IMPACTED AFRICAN
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN THAT AREA AND DISPLACEMENT AS PROPERTY
SKY-VALUED AND HOW IT OCCURRED OVER AND OVER DOWN TO THE
FOUNDATION OF SLAVERY AND PUSHING OUT OF BLACK COMMUNITIES IN
THE CITY. A VERY COMPLEX CONVERSATION WITH MULTIPLE INPUTS
NECESSARY. WE ARE HOSTING CONVERSATIONS WITH CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS IN REGARDS TO EXAMINING EQUITY THROUGH INTERSECTIONAL
LENS AND EXAMINING RACIAL EQUITY THROUGH THAT AND WE ASK FOR
ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE TWO MATTERS AS WAS THE ONE--RESEARCH TO
THE WAR ON DRUGS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE MELISSA.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M CALLING YOU FROM RIGHT OUTSIDE CITY HALL AT
THE RALLIES. THE TWO RALLIES THAT ARE TAKING POLICE THIS AFTERNOON,
BOTH SCHEDULED TO BE AWAY FOR PEOPLE TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AND
SPEAK TO THE CITY, WITH THE CITY, AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY.
AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY, THE WORD THAT COMES TO MIND AS I HAVE
STOOD THROUGH THIS, THE WORD COMPASSION. AND COMPASSION IS
SOMETHING THAT REALLY MEANS THAT WE DO CONSTANTLY SHOW THAT -WE DO CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE NOT A DIVIDED CITY. WE ARE NOT
A DIVIDED PEOPLE. WE ARE A PEOPLE THAT HAVE GREAT, GREAT
CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US. UNLESS WE CAN REALLY BEGIN TO SHOW BETTER
-- DEMONSTRATE BETTER COMPASSION FOR EACH OTHER, I'M FEARFUL THAT
THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON THE STEPS JUST AREN'T
GOING TO BE SOLVED IN THE WAYS THAT ALL OF US WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THEM SOLVED. AS SOMEONE WHO SHOWED UP THERE AND BEGAN -- PART
OF THE PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR THE TREES RALLY, I WANT TO INDICATE
THERE IS A CONNECTING THREAD THAT I HOPE YOU WILL KEEP IN MIND.
THAT IS, AS A CITY HAVING GREEN SPACE, HAVING SHADE TREES CAN SAVE
OUR LIVES. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT GREENING INTERVENTIONS
IN CITIES ACTUALLY SERVE TO REDUCE VIOLENT CRIME, SPECIFICALLY THE
GUN VIOLENCE THAT OUR CITY'S YOUTH SPOKE ABOUT TODAY.
SO I HOPE YOU WILL NOT DO WHAT SOME OF THE SPEAKERS DID, WHICH IS
TO SUGGEST THAT WE LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE AGENDA ITEMS.
>> I FOCUS ON GUN VIOLENCE AND TREES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
BYE-BYE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SUZANNA SCHELL?
>> HI, THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M A RESIDENT OF HARVEY STREET,
TWO BLOCKS NORTH OF RINDGE AND ADJACENT TO RINDGE -- DEVELOPMENT
OF IQHQ. AND I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 9 AND IN SUPPORT OF
TREES. AS YOU KNOW, A COALITION OF NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND
NONPROFITS HAS BEEN MEETING WITH THE DEVELOPER AND TOGETHER WE
HAVE MADE TERRIFIC PROGRESS ON A BEAUTIFUL NEW VISION FOR THE OPEN


PAGE 14

SPACE SURROUNDING JERRY'S POND. IT IS TIME FOR THE CITY TO INVEST
PUBLIC RESOURCES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO RINDGE AVENUE ON THE SOUTH
SIDE OF JERRY'S POND, INCLUDING SIDEWALKS, PROTECTED BIKE LANES AND
TREE CANOPY. THE CITY HAS NEGLECTED THIS AREA OF CAMBRIDGE WHILE
OTHER PARTS HAVE RECEIVED MAJOR STREET-SCAPE IMPROVEMENTS. AS A
RESIDENT, I WATCHED TREES BEING CUT DOWN, ESPECIALLY VERY LARGE OAK
TREES WHEN THE PUBLIC HOUSING WAS RENOVATED A FEW YEARS BACK. A
BLOCK AWAY, IS JERRY'S POND AND THERE ARE FEW TREES THERE. I THINK
WE COULD HELP TO MEND THIS BY COMMITTING MORE RESOURCES TO THE
STREETS SCAPE AND IMPROVEMENTS HERE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE JAMES WILLIAMSON.
>> HI. CAN YOU...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAN'T HEAR YOU, JAMES.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO.
>> YOUR CONNECTION IS POOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THE CONNECTION IS NOT STRONG. THE CONNECTION
IS GOING IN AND OUT.
>> YOU ARE HEARING ME SOMETIMES AND NOT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU ARE GOOD RIGHT NOW. GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY. FIRST, I LIVE AT JACKSON PLACE AT JEFFERSON PARK WHERE I WAS
A TIME PRESIDENT OF THE TENANT COUNCIL. I WANT TO SAY I FIND IT VERY
HEARTENING, THE INTEREST THAT PEOPLE SHOW IN THE ENVIRONMENT HERE
AND THE FUTURE -- AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TREES AND WHAT PEOPLE
CALL THE TREE CANOPY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INTEREST. I WISH THAT
THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN SORT OF MARGINAL INTEREST IN TRYING TO
SAVE TREES THAT CAN BE SAVED, BUT I WISH THERE WAS THE SAME LEVEL OF
INTEREST ACROSS THE BOARD ON THE PART OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING
THE PLANNING AT THE HOUSING AUTHORITY.
AND I THINK THE POLICY ORDER THAT IS FOCUSSED MAINLY ON THE TREES AT
THE TOBIN, IT DOES TALK ABOUT INFLUENCING WHERE THE CITY HAS
INFLUENCE. AND THE CITY -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST WILL BE ASKED
TO FUND, IN PART, THE PLANS, THE PROJECT HERE, AND THERE WILL BE
OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THE CITY ARE INVOLVED. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS
POLICY ORDER SIX COULD BE SHARPENED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHEN
OUR MONEY IS BEING USED TO ENHANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN
CAMBRIDGE, IT OUGHT TO INCLUDE UNDERSTANDING TREES AS ESSENTIAL
INFRASTRUCTURE JUST AS WE ASK THAT BE DONE AT THE TOBIN.
I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ON THE RINDGE AVENUE FINANCING, I
DID SEND A SUGGESTED LANGUAGE FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD SAY,
WHATEVER MONEY GOES FOR AND SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT
THE COMMUNITY'S -- DIVERSE COMMUNITY COMES UP WITH BY WAY OF


PAGE 15

DEMOCRATIC AND INCLUSIVE PROCESS. HOPEFULLY A CONSENSUS CAN BE
REACHED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT UP, I DON'T
THINK MIKE IS IN THE ZOOM.
>> MIKE AND NICOLE HAVE AREN'T JOINED. IF WE CAN GO BACK AND CALL
ON SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE SKIPPED.
>> HI, MY NAME IS RAYSCHELL. SPECIFICALLY FOR 161, TO RENAME THE
BASKETBALL COURTS AT PEMBERTON STREET AFTER MY SON WHO WAS SHOT
AND MURDERED THERE. A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE HOME ON CHESTER
STREET. AND ALSO THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE WHICH IS A GREAT INITIATIVE TO
HELP YOUNG KIDS STAY OFF THE STREETS. THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> I'M LOOKING FOR THE NEXT PERSON WHO IS ON THE CALL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TAKE YOUR TIME.
>> NEXT PERSON.
>> I'M HERE. I'M KINI. BORN AND RAISED IN CAMBRIDGE. A SCHOOL
COUNSELOR AT THE CAMBRIDGE STREET UPPER SCHOOL SINCE 2012 AND A
MENTAL HEATH CLINICIAN SINCE 2004. I'M FUNCTIONING AS THE
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOL DEPARTMENT INTERIM YOUTH ADVOCATE
SPECIALIST UNDER THE EQUITY AND INCLUSION OFFICE. A MOTHER OF A
12-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND CAREGIVER TO MY 16-YEAR-OLD NIECE. THANK YOU
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS ORDER 159, ASKS YOU TO FUND OUR
MENTORING PROGRAM, FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. IT CONNECTS CAMBRIDGE
MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH TO EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH ACTIVITIES
AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH MENTORSHIP. WE PROVIDE
SCHOLARS WITH OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCLUDE ENTREPRENEURSHIP,
FINANCIAL LITERACY, SOCIAL JUSTICE EDUCATION, ACTIVISM, COMMUNITY
RELATIONS, ARTS, YOGA, ACADEMIC, AND MORE. WITH THE INTENTION OF
DIMINISHING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND VIOLENCE THAT IS OCCURRING IN
CAMBRIDGE. WE FUNCTION AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE TO ADDRESS THE
NEEDS OF THE MIDDLE-SCHOOL YOUNG PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE. AS A
COUNSELOR I WORK WITH MANY CAMBRIDGE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE
ENDED UP IN JAIL OR DEAD.
MOST OF THEM EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF TRAUMA IN THEIR LIVES.
WORKING WITH THEM, I TRY TO FIND RESOURCES THAT WOULD SUPPORT
THEM AND ENDED UP FINDING VERY FEW. THE RESOURCES DIDN'T EXIST.
GIVEN THIS AS WELL AS OTHER INEQUITIES IN THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC
SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM, MYSELF AND OTHER EMPLOYEES, CREATED
FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. SINCE THE FOUNDING, WE HAVE FUNDED FRIDAY NIGHT
HYPE FROM OUR POCKETS, THE SUPPORT OF FRIENDS, PARENTS OF THE
YOUTH AND SMALL GRANTS. WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THIS
PROGRAM WITHOUT SUSTAINED FUNDING. CAMBRIDGE IS IN A CRISIS AND
YOUNG PEOPLE HURT. WE NEED PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO STAY IN PLACE
TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH A HOLISTIC APPROACH. IF YOU ARE


PAGE 16

Aug 2 2021

INVESTED IN YOUNG PEOPLE, WE NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK
TAKE A YEAR, IT IS LONG-TERM. WE HAVE TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER.
BEHAVIOR IS A FORM ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I STILL DON'T SEE MIKE. WE'LL GO TO
YOUR LIST.
>> NEXT WE HAVE PAULA. IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ORDER NUMBER 159, FRIDAY
NIGHT HYPE, EQUITY ROADMAPS. AND I'M A CAREGIVER TO A 13-YEAR-OLD
AND -- MY GRANDSON. AND MY KIDS GREW UP HERE. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE IS
A VERY POSITIVE THING FOR THE KIDS IN THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CATCH THE KIDS AT A YOUNG AGE AND A LOT OF
POSITIVE MENTORS IN THAT PROGRAM.
YOU KNOW, WE NEED A LOT OF FUNDING TO KEEP IT GOING. WE CAN'T JUST
START SOMETHING AND THEN HAVE IT END BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY TO
KEEP IT GOING. RIGHT. WE ALL KNOW THE CITY HAS THE MONEY AND I'M
HERE IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF HAVING THAT FUNDED IN AN ONGOING
FUNDING, NOT JUST A ONE-TIME FUND. AND I NEED IT TO BE LIKE... OKAY,
NOT RIGHT NOW, JUST FUND IT RIGHT NOW AND ONCE YOU BECOME -- YOU
KNOW, ELECTION YEAR IS OVER, IT HAS TO COME BACK ON AGAIN. NO. WE
NEED A PERMANENT FIX AND WE NEED THAT FUNDED ONGOING. IT IS A
POSITIVE THING IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK IT NEEDS TO STAY. BUT IT
NEEDS FUNDING IT OR IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE ANYMORE. I'M IN TOTAL
SUPPORT OF 159, FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE DEBBIE.
>> NEXT, WE HAVE AMY. GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI, I'M AMY. A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND I HAVE TWO CHILDREN THAT
LIVE HERE CURRENTLY, TWO TEENAGERS. I'M CALLING IN TODAY TO SUPPORT
POLICY ORDER 159, NOT 150 AS IT SAYS. MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT. I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE. I HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
AND HALF OR SO, THE PROGRESS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS MADE. THE
IMPACT THEY HAD ON OUR YOUTH. I'M ACTUALLY QUITE SAD THAT MY SON
IS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND BECAUSE HE WILL GO INTO HIGH SCHOOL. I WISH
THIS PROGRAM WAS STARTED EARLIER. AND THIS PROGRAM FUNCTIONS AS
A PREVENTIVE MEASURE TO DEGREES NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY HAVE
QUALIFIED PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE PROGRAM AND ARE HERE TO HELP
AT-RISK YOUTH. HERE TO HELP AND JUST LET THE KIDS HAVE FUN IN A SAFE
ENVIRONMENT, SAFE SPACE AND EVERYTHING GOING ON RECENTLY, THIS
PROGRAM IS NEEDED MORE THAN EVER. AND THEIR FUNDING NEEDS TO
STAY LONG-TERM, NOT SHORT-TERM.
AND I HOPE THAT YOU ALL HEAR THIS MESSAGE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
MY TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.

>> NEXT WE HAVE KATHY WATKINS. IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> I LIVE AT 90 FAUCET STREET IN CAMBRIDGE AND I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT
POLICY ORDER 162 ABOUT ADDRESSING THE INCREASE GUN ACTIVITY. I'D
LIKE TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 164 ABOUT CHANGING THE
PRACTICES IN THE PROJECTS IN THE CITY SO THAT TREES ARE TREATED AS AN
ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD THIS BEFORE,
LOWER-INCOME PEOPLE NEED TREES JUST AS MUCH AS WEALTHIER PEOPLE
AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CREATING GHETTOS OF LOW-INCOME
PEOPLE IN AREAS OF THE CITY, NORTH CAMBRIDGE, THE PORT, LOTS OF
AREAS WHERE I LIVE IN THE QUADRANGLE, WHICH IS NOT ALL LOW-INCOME,
BUT CERTAINLY NO TREES HERE.
THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF STUDIES ABOUT HOW THE LACK OF TREES ADDS TO ILL
HEALTH, SUCH AS ASTHMA, AND THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST
PUSH UNDER THE RUG ANYMORE. PLEASE STOP CUTTING DOWN THE TREES
AND STOP GIVING MONEY TO PROJECTS WHERE THIS IS OCCURRING. AND
FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER 165, PLEASE DON'T
BUILD LABS RIGHT NEAR HOUSING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> DEBBIE, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND ALL CITY COUNCILLORS FOR
GIVING ME THIS TIME TO SPEAK. I'M DEBBY AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF
FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE, POLICY ORDER 159. AND I'M ONE OF THE
CO-FOUNDERS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, I'M A MOM. A MOM OF THREE
CHILDREN WITH MY YOUNGEST BEING 14. JUST LEAVING MIDDLE SCHOOL.
AND I JUST -- I KNOW YOU HEARD A COUPLE OF OTHER FOUNDERS SPEAK.
WHAT I WANT TO SAY, HOW IT CAME ABOUT.
THIS WAS IN BACK IN 2019, MYSELF, WITH THE FAMILY LIAISON, WILL ADAMS,
HAD AN EVENT AT THE SCHOOL. AT THE TIME I WAS A TITLE 1 FAMILY
LIAISON. I'M THE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST AT CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS AND WE HAD AN EVENT FOR CAREGIVERS AND STUDENTS. AND
ONLY THE STUDENTS SHOWED UP. AND WE DIDN'T GET ANY CAREGIVERS.
WHAT WE NOTICED WERE THE KIDS THAT SHOWED UP, THEY ARE THE KIDS
THAT REALLY HAD DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSECURITIES AT HOME. ONE OF
THEM BEING FOOD.
AND SO, THEY ATE. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING. I ALWAYS SAY IT WAS THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL EVENT THAT I HAVE BEEN TO. AFTER THEY ATE, THEY
GRADUALLY WENT OVER TO THE BASKETBALL COURT AND PLAYED. JUST
PLAYED. THEY WERE JUST -- I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE.
AND SO WILL AND I DECIDED, WOW, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT THING IF WE
CAN DO THAT ALL OF THE TIME. WE HELD A MEETING. LO AND BEHOLD,
OTHERS WERE THINKING THE SAME THING. AND THAT'S HOW FRIDAY NIGHT
HYPE BECAME. WE POUR OUR HEARTS, MIND, EVERYTHING INTO FRIDAY


PAGE 18

Aug 2 2021

NIGHT HYPE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. I APOLOGIZE, EACH
SPEAKER HAS TWO MINUTES. CAN YOU READ OFF WHO IS NEXT?
>> WE HAVE CALLED ON EVERYBODY WHO APPEARS TO BE IN THE ZOOM. I
CAN CALL ON THE NAMES OF FOLKS THAT WERE SKIPPED IN CASE THEY WERE
WAITING TO GET ON. WE HAVE JEN JAMES? I DON'T SEE JEN. WE HAVE ARI?
ERIC? GERALD? SUSAN? DINAH? COLLIE? MADELINE? JOHANNA? SHERRY
ADAMS? SASHADA. VICKY? HASSON? DANIEL? NICOLE? JANINE?
ALEXANDRA? FRED MYER? ADAM GOLD? MIKE NAKAGAWA. AND NICOLA
WILLIAMS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THAT CONCLUDES PUBLIC COMMENT. I WILL
ENTERTAIN THE MOTION TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE MOTION BY
COUNCILLOR CARLONE TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

Motion to close Public
Comment.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO -- PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED. WE
MOVE TO SUBMISSION OF THE RECORD FOR THE REGULAR CITY COUNCIL
MEETING HOLD ON MAY 10 AND 24. ON THE MOTION BY COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS TO ACCEPT THE MINUTES FROM THE MEETINGS, WE'LL DO A ROLL

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RECONSIDERATIONS. THERE ARE NONE.
MOVING TO THE CITY MANAGER'S AGENDA. PLEASURE OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

Motion to accept the records

AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 1. (READING CITY
MANAGER'S ITEM NUMBER 1). COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER, YOU HAVE
THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I HAD A QUESTION
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE CITY FOR THE PAST YEAR IS TALKING ABOUT
CREATING AN ALTERNATE PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE THAT WOULD HAVE ITS
OWN LINE AND HANDLE SOME EMERGENCY CALLS COMING IN THROUGH THE
EMERGENCY LINE. SO, I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IF THAT GRANT FUNDING

CAN BE USED FOR THAT AND IF THE CITY STARTED TO EXPLORE ANY DETAIL
HOW CITIES THAT HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS ALREADY, LIKE EUGENE,
OAKLAND, DENVER, THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT HANDLE THAT EMERGENCY
DISPATCH PIECE AND IF THAT IS THE NEXT STEP OF THE CITY.
>> THE CITY MANAGER JUST GOT -- LOST HIS CONNECTION. I WILL JUST
START AND CHRISTINA CAN FILL IN. THIS BASICALLY IS A FORMULA-DRIVEN
GRANT. BASICALLY HAS VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE MONIES
CAN BE USED FOR OR CAN BE UTILIZED BASED UPON THE STATE STATUTE AND
REGULATIONS. I WILL LET CHRISTINA SAY, BUT I THINK THE LEVEL OF
FLEXIBILITY IS LIMITED. IF I MISSPOKE, YOU CAN CORRECT ME. MY DAYS OF
RECALLING THE GRANT AND PURPOSES ARE PRETTY FINITE. CHRISTINA?
>> THANK YOU. THE GRANT IS A FORMULA GRANT AND BASED ON THE 911
EMERGENCY CALLS IN THE CENTER AND SPECIFIC FOR THE USE. THINGS LIKE
DISPATCHERS, TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE FUNCTIONS OF
DISPATCH, THICK OUR CAD SYSTEM AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THERE IS
PROBABLY ABOUT 20,000 THAT CAN BE USED FOR THINGS THAT WOULD
SUPPORT FIELD OPERATIONS. WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE FURTHER
DISCUSSION BUSY THAT. TYPICALLY THE FORMULA IS BASED ON THE CALLS
AND BASED ON SUPPORTING PCAPs, PUBLIC ANSWERING POINT FOR THE
CITY.
>> NOTHING THAT LIMITS TO POLICE OR FIRE. JUST GENERALLY DISPATCH.
LIKE THE HEART PROPOSAL COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT?
>> CHRISTINA: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT IS FOR THE
PCAP OPERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IT DOESN'T SUPPORT ANY OF THE POLICE
OR FIRE OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD. WE CAN'T PAY FOR POLICE RECORD
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH THIS GRANT BECAUSE IT IS SPECIFIC TO 911. IN
THE EVENT OR THROUGH DISCUSSIONS AND BEING A MEMBER OF THE CITY
MANAGER'S TASK FORCE, TO MY RECOLLECTION, ONE RECOMMENDATION IS
HIRING A SOCIAL WORKER FOR THE 911 CENTER. THAT MIGHT BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE RELATED IN THE PCAP AND
INTEGRATED AND SUPPORT FIELD SERVICES. IF YOU FOLLOW ME.

Transmitting Communication
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to the
appropriation of the Adult and

Massachusetts Department of

Education (DESE) in the amount
of $1,190,717.00 to the Grant
Fund Human Service Programs
Salary and Wages account
($1,145,357.00), to the Grant
Fund Human Service Programs

used for ESOL services.

appropriation of the Family
Shelter grant received from the
Department of Housing and
Community Development
(DHCD) in the amount of
$664,250.33 to the Grant Fund
Human Service Programs Other
Ordinary Maintenance account
which will be subcontracted to
the Cambridge YWCA.

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I THINK SO. AND THE QUESTION IS, IT
IS NOT ABOUT FIELD SERVICES, THAT ALTERNATE PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE IS
THE DISPATCH PIECE. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE USED FOR THAT. THE
OTHER PIECE, IF THE CITY STARTED TO TALK WITH OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE A
PROGRAM LIKE AND HOW THE DISPATCH WORKS. WE HAD A CALL ABOUT
THIS WITH STAFF A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND MOVING FORWARD. I'M
CURIOUS ABOUT HOW FAR DOWN THE LINE WE HAVE GONE LOOKING AT THE
DETAILS. IF WE HAVEN'T, WE HAVEN'T AND THAT'S FINE. JUST CURIOUS.
>> CHRISTINA: I WAS CORRECTED, THE LICENSED SOCIAL WORKER WOULDN'T
FIT INTO THE GRANT. MY APOLOGIES. TO YOUR POINT, THERE ARE
DISCUSSIONS, THE CITY MANAGER MET WITH THE BLACK RESPONSE AND
OTHER INTERNAL MEETINGS AND SO FORTH. THE DISPATCH COMPONENT, IF
IT IS GOING TO BE PERFORMED BY OUR DISPATCHER STAFF IN THE PCAP,
THERE IS CONSIDERATION THERE. IT IS PERFORMED OUTSIDE OF THE CITY


PAGE 20

Aug 2 2021

AGENCY OR DISPATCH, IT WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANTS.
>> CITY MANAGER: I GUESS I CAN JUMP. I APOLOGIZE. THIS IS AN
EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS GRANT. IT WILL BE USED FOR THE
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ONLY. I DON'T THINK IT IS ELIGIBLE FOR
ANYTHING ELSE. AS I STATED AT THE LAST MEETING, THE 911 SYSTEM RIGHT
NOW, WE DO NOT SEE LEAVING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THAT WOULD
STAY. IN ANY RECOMMENDATION IN THE ECC DEPARTMENT. THAT'S WHERE
WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE
IS ANYONE NOT USING ECC AS THE COMMUNICATIONS GROUP AND THERE IS
NO INTENT TO GIVE UP THE ECC PORTION OF ANY SYSTEM WE PUT IN.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANKS. IT MAKES SENSE. TRYING TO
GET A SENSE OF HOW IT CAN INTEGRATE INTO THE GRANT IN EMERGENCY
SERVICES. I YIELD BACK. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER HANDS UP ON THIS? NOT MINE. I
ACCIDENTALLY RAISED IT. I DON'T SEE ANY. ROLL CALL ON THE
APPROPRIATION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE APPROPRIATION?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.

>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM 2. A COMMUNICATION
ON THE -- I'M SORRY. I MISS MY NOTES. (READING CITY MANAGER'S ITEM
NUMBER 2). THIS IS PULLED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND TO CHARLES SULLIVAN, I FOUND THIS LANDMARK
DESIGNATION REPORT EXTRAORDINARY. THIS EVENING IT IS AN EVENING OF
HISTORICAL REVIEW, NOT ONLY ABOUT ALBERTA V SCOTT, BUT MARIA
BALDWIN AND MR. MOSES AS WELL. AND I'M HOPING THAT ALL THE
COUNCILLORS READ THIS RICH DOCUMENT. ALBERT A SCOTT, THIS
DESIGNATION IS IMPORTANT TO ME, AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT
EARLIER ON, THERE WAS AN ORGANIZATION THAT I HEADED WITH -- I HAD
WITH KATHLEEN AND CORRINNE, BLACK HISTORY LOST AND FOUND, AND
ALBERTA V SCOTT IS ONE OF THE HEROINS THAT WE RAISE UP FOR
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. THE STORY IS EXTRAORDINARY SAD. SHE DIED AT A

PAGE 21

Aug 2 2021

YOUNG AGE. SHE WAS ABLE TO MAKE HISTORY AND JUST BRINGING HER
FORWARD IN THIS WAY I THINK IS IMPORTANT THROUGH THE DESIGNATION
OF THIS PROPERTY. THERE IS A LARGER THAN LIFE-SIZE PICTURE OF HER IN
THE CAP AND GOWN, WHICH IS CERTAINLY A DECENT TESTIMONY, BUT THIS
GOES SO MUCH FURTHER.
I'M JUST PLEASED TO SEE THIS, TO HAVE READ THE REPORT, TO READ ABOUT
THE PEOPLE THAT OWN THE PROPERTY PRIOR TO ALBERTA SCOTT AND HER
FAMILY, AND THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS IMPORTANT
DESIGNATION. SO, I WOULD LIKE TO FROM -- ANY ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION FROM MR. SULLIVAN, CHARLES SULLIVAN, IF HE WANTS TO
GIVE MORE HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT THIS PROPERTY. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT,
AFTER WHICH I WILL MOVE THE POLICY ORDER THAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE
REPORT FOR THAT DESIGNATION.
>> GOOD EVENING. I THINK THE LANDMARK REPORT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.
WRITTEN BY MY COLLEAGUE, SARAH BURKES. ALBERTA SCOTT WAS AN
emblematic FIGURE, A GRADUATE AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO OTHER
MINORITY RADCLIFFE STUDENTS. DISTINGUISHED STUDENT AND
DISTINGUISH GRADUATE OF THE LATIN SCHOOL AND INVITED TO TEACH AT
AN INSTITUTE AND SPENT ONLY A SEMESTER THERE BEFORE SHE BECAME ILL
AND CAME BACK TO CAMBRIDGE AND DIED AT AGE 27. THE HOUSE THE
PARENTS RENTED, WAS A MODEST HOME ON UNION STREET. BUT IT
SYMBOLIZES THE CHARACTER OF A VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AT THE END OF THE 19TH AND THE
BEGINNING OF THE 20TH AFTERNOON. IN A NEIGHBORHOOD, AT THE TIME,
HAD A STRONG AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THE DEVELOPMENT
PRESSURES IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE ELSEWHERE IN
THE CAMBRIDGE. IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THIS HOUSE -- TO LOSE ITS
FEATURES AND POSSIBLE TO ALLOW EXPANSION IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY
WHICH IS THE LANDMARK DESIGNATION WOULD PROMOTE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I THANK HIM FOR THE REPORT.
AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE EVENING THAT WE'LL RAISING UP THE
IMPORTANT WOMEN. ONE OTHER WOMEN THAT IS PROMINENT IN
RADCLIFFE HISTORY, IS EVA, RECEIVED PH.D. FROM RADCLIFFE. VERY LITTLE IS
KNOWN FOR HER. I SEE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HANDS RAISED. AFTER THE
DISCUSSION, I RESPECTFULLY MOVE WE ADOPT THE POLICY ORDER
EMBEDDED IN THE REPORT. FOR NOW, I YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUES AND
AFTER WHICH I MOVE FOR THE ADOPTION OF THIS POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU, DIRECTOR SULLIVAN AND COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS FOR THIS. I WILL BE BRIEF. IT IS VERY EXCITING. I AGREE WITH THE
TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT DESIGNATION. IT
REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE UPLIFTING HISTORICAL FIGURES.
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS KNOWS, I SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS WORKING ON A
BOOK TO ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN, THIS IS A FIGURE IN
THAT AND RESEARCHING THE HISTORY OF RADCLIFFE, MOST PEOPLE DON'T
REALIZE, IT IS BECAUSE HARVARD DIDN'T LET PEOPLE IN. THERE IS A HISTORY

THERE. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN WITH TOO SHORT A LIFE AND
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND GLAD FOR THE LEADERSHIP SHOWN ON
NUMBER OF AREAS ABOUT THE HISTORICAL COMMISSION. I KNOW
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS PUSHED FORWARD ON THIS. THANK YOU AND I
YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THROUGH YOU TO MR. SULLIVAN, I
WAS VERY MOVED BY THIS REPORT. LEARNING ABOUT SOMEONE I KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT. CHARLIE, FORGIVE ME, I
MIGHT BE IGNORANT ON THIS, BUT DO WE HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE ON
THE WEB WE HAVE DESCRIPTIONS OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND WHY WE
CONSIDER THEM HISTORIC. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, IF YOU ARE ON THE
STREET, YOU SEE A PLAQUE, IS THERE A WAY TO LEARN ABOUT IT RIGHT
THERE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD? DO WE HAVE SOMETHING -- I KNOW IN
BOOKS WE DO, BUT DO WE HAVE THAT IN THE FORM OF A WEBSITE?
>> MR. SULLIVAN: THIS HOUSE IS ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TRAIL. SO
THERE IS A DESCRIPTIVE MARKER IN FRONT. ALL MARKERS ARE ON THE
WEBSITE. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MARKERS AND ALL THE OTHER ONES
MAINTAIN. WE DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FIND ON
YOUR SMART PHONE AND READ OFF AUTOMATICALLY BY BEING IN A
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. THAT IS SOMETHING WE DREAM ABOUT. WE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH THAT YET.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I JUST THINK A
PROGRAM LIKE THAT WOULD BE BRING THE STORIES TO LIFE THAT
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, AND I BELIEVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN, BROUGHT
FORTH. THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK. THANK YOU, MAYOR SIDDIQUI.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY LIKE TO
PRESENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL THE POLICY ORDER THAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE
PRESENTATION, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS. ORDERED THAT THE ALBERTA
SCOTT HOUSE AT 28 JUNE STREET BE DESIGNATED A PROTECTED LANDMARK
-- AS RECOMMENDED BY THE VOTE OF THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORICAL
COMMISSION ON MAY 6, 2021. THE LAND DEFINE -- (READING FROM THE
DOCUMENT). PREMISES DESCRIBED IN A DEED RECORDED IN THE BOOK.
(READING FROM THE DOCUMENT).
THE HOUSE IS BUILT IN 1866, EXHIBITS THE BROAD ARCHITECTURE AND
ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE CAMBRIDGE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS
NOW FINALLY KNOWN IN PART AS THE PORT. AS AN EXAMPLE OF
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION DURING THE EARLY INDUSTRIALIZED PERIOD OF
THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND SIGNIFICANT FOR THE IMPORTANT
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WOODS, SCOTT AND PANE FAMILY DURING THE POST
CIVIL WAR PERIOD AND THE BLACK POPULATION IN CAMBRIDGE WAS
INCREASING AND BE IT FURTHER ORDER, THE EFFECT OF THIS DESIGNATION
SHALL BE THE REVIEW OF HISTORICAL COMMISSION AND THE ISSUANCE OF
CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS... SHALL BE REQUIRED BEFORE ANY
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY CAN TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE DESIGNATED

PREMISES FOR ANY ACTION CAN BE -- AFFECTING THE APPEARANCE OF THE
PREMISES THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE FROM A PUBLIC WAY. AND MAKING
DETERMINATIONS THAT THE COMMISSION SHALL BE GUIDED BY THE TERMS
OF THE FINAL LANDMARK REPORT, THE PREMISES OF SECTION 7, STAND IN
CRITERIA OF SAID REPORT AND THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS OF CHAPTER 2.78,
ARTICLE THREE OF THE CAMBRIDGE MUNICIPAL CODE. I MOVE THE
ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSED POLICY ORDER.

>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.

City Manager’s Agenda #2
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to a
recommendation of the
Cambridge Historical
Commission to approve the final
Landmark Designation Report for
the Alberta V. Scott House at 28
Union Street.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WITH THAT, WE ARE DONE WITH THE CITY MANAGER'S
AGENDA. WE'LL MOVE TO THE CALENDAR. THERE'S TWO CHARTER RIGHT
ITEMS ON THE CALENDAR. THE FIRST ONE IS COMMUNICATION
TRANSMITTED FROM THE CITY MANAGER RELATIVE TO AWAITING REPORT
ITEM NUMBER 21-41. CLOSING MASS AVENUE FROM PROSPECT STREET TO
SIDNEY STREET ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EVENINGS. IT IS EXERCISED BY
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WILL MOVE THIS TO THE TABLE. WE ARE
HAVING CONTINUED CONVERSATION. IT LOOKS LIKE CLOSING OFF MASS
AVENUE MAY NOT BE THE OPTION, BUT TALKING ABOUT OTHER SIDE STREETS
AND HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THIS. IT IS A CHARTER RIGHT. I WILL ASK WE MOVE IT TO THE TABLE
AND LET ME CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ON THAT. I SEE A HAND UP. I THINK COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I VOTE FOR TABLING THIS, BUT I
WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUE EXPLORING AND CONSIDERING CLOSING MASS
AVENUE. I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT WE ARE ONLY TALKING
ABOUT THE SIDE STREETS. IS THERE NO CONSIDERATION AT ALL FOR CLOSING
MASS AVENUE, EVEN FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME.


PAGE 24

Aug 2 2021

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WOULD SAY, I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT AS
-- WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND THE CITY LOOKED INTO THAT. THERE
ARE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT IT AND EVEN SOME FOLKS FROM THE BID HAD
CIRCLED BACK AND HAD CONCERNS ABOUT IT. I THINK PROBABLY ANYTHING
IS ON THE TABLE. RIGHT NOW, NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE AND WE ARE -IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MASS AVENUE WOULD POTENTIALLY BE AN OPTION.
THAT'S THE ORIGINAL -- THAT WAS MY HOPE AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO
WORK THROUGH IT. WE ARE NOT READY TO -- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
OTHER THINGS. THE CITY'S INITIAL REPORT WAS NO THAT MASS AVENUE
CAN'T BE CLOSED. WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT AND TALKING ABOUT
OTHER POSSIBILITIES. I WOULD LIKE THE TIME TO DO THAT AND HOPEFULLY
BY THE TIME WE GET BACK IN SEPTEMBER, WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT
OUT THERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. MOTION TO PLACE
THIS ON THE TABLE. AND WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON THE MOTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL).

Calendar #1
A communication transmitted
from Louis A. DePasquale, City
Manager, relative to Awaiting
Report Item Number 21-41,
regarding a report on closing
Mass Ave from Prospect Street to
Sidney Street on Friday and
Saturday evenings.

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO CHARTER RIGHT TWO. ENDORSEMENT OF
THE AGASSIZ NAME BEING CHANGED IN HONOR OF MARIA BALDWIN.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: I COULDN'T BE EXCITED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO
VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AFTER AN INSPIRING CAMBRIDGE WOMAN. I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE
EFFORT FROM THE BEGINNING AND I TOTALLY LOVE THIS EFFORT IS SPURRED
BY -- MAYA COUNTER. 20 YEARS AGO, A YOUNG PERSON THAT LED US, AN
8TH GRADER, WHO INITIATED THE NAME CHANGE OF HIS SCHOOL TO BE
BECOME THE MARIA BALDWIN SCHOOL. I WAS IN THE ROOM, CHEERED AND
INSPIRED BY THE VOTE 20 YEARS AGO. IT IS OVER DUE AND WE ARE AT THE
POINT OF THINKING ABOUT CHANGING THE NEIGHBORHOOD NAME. I
EXERCISED MY CHARTER RIGHT BECAUSE RESIDENTS WERE TAKEN OFF
GUARD, I BELIEVE THE CONCERNS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BY THIS ACTION. I BELIEVE IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN ABOUT THE PROCESS,
LEARN ABOUT THE PLAN AND KNOW WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED. THERE'S

PAGE 25

Aug 2 2021

ALMOST CONSENSUS, NOT UNANIMOUS, THE AGASSIZ NAMED SHOULD BE
REMOVED AND THE EXTENSIVE PROCESS INDICATES A PREFERENCE FOR THE
NAME TO BE BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD. I NOTE THE SCHOOL USED TO BE
CALLED AGASSIZ SO THE CHANGE IS IN LINE. I WANT TO NOTE I BELIEVE THE
CITY, NOT THE NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP OR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR
ADVOCATES, THE CITY COULD AND SHOULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF
OUTREACH TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT AND
FELT INCLUDED. COVID INTERVENED, IT WAS DIFFICULT AND YET THE CITY
DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE
NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP AND VOLUNTEERS STEPPED IN AND TOOK ON MORE
THAN REASONABLY EXPECTED. WE OWE THEM GRATITUDE AND THE
PROCESS HAPPENED. WITH MORE TIME, I BELIEVE MORE PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND ARE SUPPORTIVE. THIS WON'T BE THE LAST
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET OR BUILDING TO BE RENAMED. THE COLLEAGUES
ARE WORKING ON MANY OTHER THINGS TO BE RENAMED AND ON BOARD
AND THRILLED WITH THAT EFFORT. I HOPE THAT WE MAKE SURE WHEN WE
WORK ON THE PROCESS WE CAN APPLY TO ANY NAME CHANGE IN THE
FUTURE SO THERE ARE -- THEY ARE NOT SURPRISED. I LOOK FORWARD TO
VOTING FOR IT TONIGHT AND I YIELD. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M GLAD TO HAVE COUNCILLOR
NOLAN ON BOARD. I WANT TO JUST FIRST START BY THANKING MAYA
COUNTER, SHE TOOK IT, THE MAYOR BROUGHT ME INTO THIS CONVERSATION
SOME TIME AGO WHEN MAYA COUNTER REACHED OUT AND SAID IT IS
SOMETHING SHE WANTED TO DO. THE MAYOR KNOWING I HAD A KEEN
INTEREST AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MAYA COUNTER FOR A LONG
TIME. I THINK ABOUT TWO YEARS. MAYBE MORE. THAT'S IMPORTANT. I
UNDERSTAND AND I HEAR WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID ABOUT CITY
INTERVENTION. WE REALLY WANTED THIS TO BE AS ORGANIC AS POSSIBLE.
IF YOU DID NOT SEE AS MUCH HANDS-ON AS YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED,
PLEASE UNDERSTAND IT WAS IN PART BECAUSE WE REALLY WANTED THIS TO
BE WHERE IT STARTED, WHICH IS NEIGHBORHOOD-DRIVEN AND WANT TO
RESPECT THAT. I CAN'T SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH TO MAYA COUNTER, AND
THE AGASSIZ NEIGHBORHOOD. WE TALKED ABOUT MARIA BALDWIN, THIS IS
A WOMAN, AS IS THE CASE OF ALBERTA SCOTT. SHE DID EXTRAORDINARY
WORK, CAME OUT OF CAMBRIDGE, WENT TO SCHOOL, LIVED ON CLARK
STREET FROM 1882 TO 1888. WENT TO TEACHER SCHOOL TO BECOME
EDUCATED TO BECOME A TEACHER. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE, DECEMBER 4,
1880, WILLIAM HAZEL REMARKED IN THE CAMBRIDGE CHRONICLE HOW THE
COLORED CITIZENS, WHICH WE WERE REGARDED AS, WERE OUTRAGED
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE WAS SO SLOW ABOUT POINTING A BLACK
PERSON TO THE POSITION OF TEACHERS. THERE WERE TWO CANDIDATES.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY AND SEE AND RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE,
THAT HISTORY. MARIA BALDWIN WORKED WITH NOTABLES LIKE FRANCIS
HARPER, PAULINE HOPKINS, DOING RICH AND EXTRAORDINARY WORK, NOT
LIMITED, BUT INCLUDING THE FOUNDING OF THE LEAGUE FOR WOMEN
COMMUNITY SERVICE. TURNING THEIR WORK TOWARD THAT OF BETTERING
THE CONDITION OF YOUNG GIRLS. THEY WERE TALKING SPECIFICALLY OF


PAGE 26

Aug 2 2021

YOUNG BLACK GIRLS.
VERY SOON THE CITY COUNCIL WILL BE IN THE POSITION OF A REPORT BY THE
MONUMENTS, MARKERS, MEMORIALS, AND PUBLIC ART COMMITTEE. IN
THAT COMMITTEE WHERE WE LOOKED AT MONUMENTS AND PUBLIC ART IN
THE CITY, WE CAME UP WITH A DEFINITION OF HOW TO LOOK AT THE
MONUMENTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT SHAMEFUL ACTS. I BRING THAT UP TO
DRAW ATTENTION TO AGASSIZ. YOU HAVE THE THIRD BULLET POINT,
ENGAGED IN WORK, AND/OR EFFORTS THAT PROMOTE THE VIOLENCE OF
WHITE supremacy OR HIERARCHY OF HUMAN VALUE BASED ON RACE,
GENDER, AND/OR OTHER ASPECTS OF HUMAN IDENTITY, INCLUDING
CATEGORIES AND THE CITY'S NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE. WE THINK
OF LOUIS AGASSIZ, epitomize MORE SHAMEFUL ACTS THAN HIS. I'M PLEASED
TO SEE THIS BEFORE US. THIS IS AN ORGANIC PROCESS. STARTED BY A
YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. HAD A STRONG
INVESTED INTEREST IN THE COMMUNITY. AND BY VOTING FOR THIS, WE ARE
LIFTING UP MARIA BALDWIN, A HEROIN OF HER TIME, WE ARE LIFTING UP
THE WORK OF A YOUNG WOMAN, THE YOUNG BLACK WOMEN, WE SAY WE
WANT ORGANIC CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT. IT DOES ALL OF
THOSE THINGS. I LEAN IN AND HOPE THAT THIS COUNCIL WILL
UNANIMOUSLY VOTE ON AND APPROVE THE NAME CHANGE TO THE MARIA
BALDWIN NEIGHBORHOOD. MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I SEE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S HAND?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME RIGHT. I REALLY WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND YOURSELF AND MAYA AND OTHERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET THINGS RIGHT A LITTLE BIT IN OUR CITY. I
HOPE WITH THIS VOTE TONIGHT, WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY TO FINALLY
CHANGING THE NAME OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. I'LL JUST
COMMENT, IT HAS BEEN REALLY A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS ON THIS AND MAYA AND OTHERS, AND REALLY IT IS ORGANIC. THIS
CAME FROM THE COMMUNITY. I THINK -- I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE
WORK THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS CONTINUES TO DO BECAUSE IT REALLY
DOES MATTER. IT IS MORE THAN A NAME. AND SO, I WANT TO ECHO WHAT
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE STEPS
BEYOND THIS.
IF THERE ARE NO OTHER HANDS, ON A MOTION TO ADOPT THIS, WE'LL DO
ROLL CALL.

THREE. (READING APPLICATION 3). COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, YOU HAVE
THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO PULL THIS
PARTICULAR ONE BECAUSE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROJECT THAT THE COUNCIL
ISN'T WEIGHING IN ON OTHERWISE BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING THE SPECIAL
PERMIT AT THE PLANNING BOARD. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PROJECT
IS DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM NEWTOWN COURT, WHICH IS
NOW SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY BIO-TECH AND TECHNOLOGY
BUILDINGS. FOR THE MOST PART, DO NOT PROVIDE ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY TO THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE THERE. WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE INSTITUTE TO GET SOME REASONABLE
ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ARE MAKING
AVAILABLE FIVE KINDERGARTEN SPOTS, SOME COMMUNITY SPACE, THEY ARE
DOING A GREEN ROOF. AND THEY RELOCATED THE OPEN SPACE SO IT FACES
NEWTOWN COURT, WHICH IS REALLY GOOD.
ON THE DOWNSIDE, THEY ARE CREATING 100 ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES
WITH THIS PROJECT. AS YOU KNOW, IT IS DOWN THE STREET FROM BOTH
THE KENDALL SQUARE T STOP. AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT MUCH MORE
TRANSIT-ORIENTED THAN ADDING 100 PARKING SPACES. I THINK WE
SHOULDN'T TAKE THESE PROJECTS FOR GRANTED. THEY REALLY ALTER OUR
CITY IN VERY SIGNIFICANT WAYS. AND AS WITH ALL THESE LARGE
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS, A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE HOUSING
MARKET THAT LEADS TO GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENTS OF OUR
RESIDENTS. THIS IS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY EVALUATE THIS
PROJECT. I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ARE AT LEAST LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT
AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF IT MOVING FORWARD AS WE
VOTE ON THIS CURB-CUT.

HE IS LEAVING BEHIND. THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS
MOVEMENT, TO VOTER RIGHTS, TO REALLY UNWAVERING DEDICATION TO
MATHEMATICS EDUCATION. SO, I THINK HE REALLY IS LEAVING BEHIND THIS
ENORMOUS LEGACY. IT IS UP TO FUTURE GENERATIONS TO LIVE UP TO IT.
AND JUST THE WEEKEND BEFORE HE PASSED, I WAS AT MAGAZINE BEACH
WITH THEM, THE OPENING OF MATH TALKS. THEY DID AN EXHIBITION
ACROSS THE BRIDGE THROUGH MATH TALKS, WHICH HIS SON HAS FOUNDED.
AND HIS LEGACY IS REALLY LIVING ON THROUGH THE AMAZING WORK OF HIS

I WAS REALLY SADDENED TO THEN LEARN THE NEXT DAY THAT HE HAD
PASSED. I KNOW OTHERS WANT TO SPEAK, I WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION
THAT BEFORE I GO TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN,
AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR. AND THANK YOU
FOR BEING THE LEAD IN HAVING ME JOIN YOU ON THIS HONOR TO BOB
MOSES. I KNOW HIM BEST AS THE FOUNDER OF THE ALGEBRA PROJECT. I
KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE, FORMER MAYOR AND COUNCILLOR DAVIS,
WERE SO MOVED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD PASSED. AND AS YOU SAID,
LEAVES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGACY. HE FELT A PASSION FOR EDUCATING
ALL CHILDREN, PARTICULARLY CHILDREN OF COLOR. THAT IS WHY HE
STARTED AND RAN THE ALGEBRA PROJECT OVER AT THE KING OPEN SCHOOL.
THAT'S JUST IN ADDITION TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS WORK THAT PRECEDED ALL OF
THAT WORK. OF COURSE, HIS WIFE AND FAMILY, BUT PARTICULARLY HIS
WIFE, JANET, WHO HAS DONE EXTRAORDINARY WORK. THESE INDIVIDUALS
LIVED A LIFE THEY -- THAT WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE LIFE, THEY LEAVE US AN
EXTRAORDINARY PATH TO FOLLOW IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD AND
CAN DO. I'M PLEASED THAT FORMER VICE-MAYOR, DENNIS -- THE AREA FOUR
YOUTH AND COMMUNITY CENTER AFTER THE MOSES FAMILY TO TYPIFY AND
TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT AND REMEMBER ON THE WORK OF
THE MOSES FAMILY IN GENERAL, BUT OF BOB MOSES IN PARTICULAR.

IT IS A LOST TO OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND I
HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY FROM FORMER MAYOR REEVES THAT THERE WILL
BE SOME VIGIL THAT WE WILL ORGANIZE TO LIFT HIM UP AND REFLECT ON
THE WORK THAT HE HAS DONE IN OUR COUNTRY, BUT ALSO IN THIS STATE,
PARTICULARLY IN OUR CITY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND
JOIN ANY MEMBER THAT WOULD LIKE TO HELP US IN DOING THIS. AGAIN, A
VERY SAD DAY IN THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO HAVE LOST SUCH A LION IN THE
WORK OF CIVIL RIGHTS. MADAM MAYOR, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN FOLLOWED BY VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID, WE
HAVE LOST AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN. AND REALLY A TREASURE TO OUR
COMMUNITY AND TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I HOPE WE CAN REALLY DO HIM
JUSTICE AS WE REMEMBER HIM AND HONOR HIS LIFE. HE APPEARS IN A NEW
MURAL AT JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY. HE IS MEMORIALIZED ALONG WITH
HIS WIFE JANET ON A MURAL AT STARLIGHT SQUARE. I HOPE WE CAN FIND A
MORE PERMANENT WAY TO REMEMBER HIM. AND WE DO HAVE MISSED
OPPORTUNITIES TO HONOR HIS LIFE ALREADY. THE YOUTH CENTER PAGE ON
THE CITY WEBSITE, DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE NAME OF THE YOUTH CENTER AT
ALL.
THAT'S AN EASY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY HONOR HIM
AND THE FAMILY. WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST IN THAT YOUTH CENTER AND
ALL YOUTH CENTERS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST

PAGE 31

Aug 2 2021

REMEMBERING HIM, BUT REALLY EMBODYING THE VALUE THAT HE PUT
FORWARD -- ALL THE EFFORT HE MADE TO BETTER OUR COMMUNITY. THE
MOSES FAMILY HAS BEEN A REALLY BIG PART OF MY LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE. MY
CHILDREN WERE TENDED TO BY JANET MOSES, SHE WAS THEIR PHYSICIAN -THEY REALLY PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE COMMUNITY AND ACROSS
THE COUNTRY. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE WE HONOR
HIS LIFE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I TOO WANT TO ECHO MY
THOUGHTS AND MY CONDOLENCES TO THE MOSES FAMILY. I GREW UP WITH
SOME OF THEM. AND I HAVE KNOWN THEM FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. AND
ANYTIME ANYBODY PASSES AWAY IN THE CITY WHO HAS DONE THINGS,
PEOPLE KNOW, IT'S TRAGIC AND HARD. IT IS ALWAYS HARD ON THE FAMILIES
TO LOSE SOMEONE. AND THEN THERE ARE FOLKS WHO SORT OF TOUCH
EVERYBODY IN THE CITY. THERE'S A RIPPLE EFFECT WHEN, IN A HOLE
CREATED WHEN SOMEONE PASSES. BOB MOSES IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.
HE MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE, OBVIOUSLY, PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW OR A LOT
OF US KNOW ABOUT HIS WORK NATIONALLY. WITH THE ALGEBRA PROJECT
AND THE ADVOCACY, WHEN YOU CAN INFLUENCE AND TOUCH THE LIVES OF
THOUSANDS OF KIDS AND YOUNG PEOPLE GROWING UP IN THE CITY, IT'S
SPECTACULAR. HE WAS SPECTACULAR. I JUST WANT TO OFFER MY
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VICE-MAYOR MALLON?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND YOURSELF FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD TONIGHT. I THINK
WE WERE ALL DEVASTATED TO LEARN THAT BOB MOSES PASSED LAST WEEK.
I THINK WE ALL THOUGHT HE WOULD BE WITH US FOREVER. AND I
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD HIM SPEAK, I THINK HE TALKED FOR
OVER AN HOUR JUST WITHOUT STOPPING ABOUT HIS WORK OF THE CIVIL
RIGHTS AND WITH MATH MATTERS AND THE ALGEBRA PROJECT. WE ARE SO,
SO LUCKY THAT BOB MOSES AND HIS FAMILY CALLED CAMBRIDGE HOME AND
DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO THE BETTERMENT OF OUR YOUTH AND CHILDREN
HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. SO, MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO JANET MOSES AND
THEIR CHILDREN. ON THIS LOSS THEY ARE FEELING VERY DEEPLY, BUT
REVERBERATING THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. I JUST WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD AND MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
TO THE MOSES FAMILY. THANK YOU AND I YIELD BACK.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I ECHO ALL OF THE WORDS OF ALL MY
COLLEAGUES. DEEPEST CONDOLENCES AND GRATITUDE HE WAS IN OUR CITY.
I HEARD HIM SPEAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND AWED. I TRIED TO CHALLENGE
HIS CHALLENGE TO US, CHANNEL HIS CHALLENGE TO US AND THE WORK ON
THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, WHEN THEY PUSHED US TO DO MORE THAN WE
WERE DOING AND MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN WE ARE DOING. MY PERSONAL
HOPE IS THAT AMONG COUNCIL NOW, THIS IS ONE CITY, THE LOSS
REVERBERATES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO CHANNEL THAT AND I CHALLENGE


PAGE 32

Aug 2 2021

US TO DO MORE TO LIVE HIS DREAM BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT YET MET IT. HE
GAVE US A CHALLENGE IN EDUCATION AND AS YOU NOTED, MAYOR SIDDIQUI,
WE ARE -- WITH MATH WORKS. WE DO SOME WORK AND HAVE TO RAMP IT
UP, PICK IT UP, AND REALLY DO HIM JUSTICE AND HONOR BY HAVING OUR
PROGRAMS REALLY BE AS EFFECTIVE AS YOU WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD BE.
THANK YOU AND I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR NOLAN. THANK YOU TO
EVERYBODY FOR THEIR WORDS. DEEP CONDOLENCES TO THE MOSES FAMILY
AND MAY MR. MOSES REST IN PEACE AND POWER. ON THE RESOLUTION TO
ADOPT, WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION NUMBER 11. RESOLUTION
FOR THE DEATH OF ROBERT, LB, FAVREAU. I THINK ABOUT WHAT HAS
HAPPENED FOR THE LAST MANY YEARS, BUT SPECIFICALLY TO -- THE LOSS WE
HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR. ROBERT AND THESE ARE BIG HOLES IN THE
COMMUNITY. AND WE ARE JUST OUTSIDE. THERE WAS A RALLY ON GUN
VIOLENCE. SAYING THEIR NAMES. I HAVE TO ADMIT, DURING THIS TIME, I
HAVE FELT REALLY -- IT IS HARD TO THINK HOW DO I MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
HOW DO WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE? I THINK THE KEY IS LISTENING. AND
THE KEY IS BEING THERE FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE
SUFFERING. AND KEEPING OUR KIDS IN MIND. AND KEEPING OUR KIDS THE
PRIORITY. AND I KNOW ALL OF US -- I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN COMING
TOGETHER, MANY OF US ON DIFFERENT MEETINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
CHAIRED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN TO
GRAPPLE WITH THIS.

Resolution #10
Resolution on the death of Robert
Moses

I THANK EVERYBODY WHO IS INVOLVED IN THE EFFORT. THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO DO AND WE CAN'T EVER LOSE SIGHT OF THESE YOUNG MEN WHO WE'RE
LOSING. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING. MY HEART GOES OUT TO
ROBERT, HIS FAMILY, HE WAS A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER, WHO LOVED TO
COOK. HAD THE ABILITY TO MAKE EVERYBODY LAUGH AND HAD A DEEP LOVE
FOR HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEM DURING THIS
REALLY, REALLY PAINFUL TIME. I SEE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN
VICE-MAYOR MALLON AND THEN COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, WITH A HEAVY HEART,
I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS POLICY ORDER. IN JULY, 28 YEARS AGO, I LOST
MY SON. THIS REALLY IMPACTED ME. I FELT THE IMPACT IN AN
EXTRAORDINARY WAY. ANY LOSS OF A CHILD IS ALWAYS EXTRAORDINARY.
THIS ONE BECAUSE IT IS ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY OWN SON'S DEATH. I
WAS REALLY MOVED BY. NO PARENT SHOULD BURY THEIR CHILD. NO
PARENT SHOULD BURY THEIR CHILD. I WANT YOU TO SIT WITH THAT FOR A
MOMENT. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN.
IMAGINE THE BURDEN THAT YOU CARRY FOR THE REST OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
OVER THE LOSS OF THAT CHILD. I DID NOT KNOW THIS YOUNG MAN. I DON'T
PERSONALLY KNOW HIS MOTHER, BUT I KNOW HER PAIN, HER ANGUISH, AND


PAGE 33

Aug 2 2021

HER STRUGGLE. I KNOW SHE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED AND
OTHERS IN THIS UNIQUE CLUB OR ORGANIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO
HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN. WHEN DOES IT STOP? WHEN DOES IT STOP?
WE ARE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. I
KNOW I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER MOTHER, A FATHER, OR SIBLING, TO HAVE
TO BURY A FAMILY MEMBER. MY HEART GOES OUT TO MS. FAVREAU IN A
WAY THAT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN UNDERSTAND. I HOPE YOU NEVER
WILL. BUT I KNOW THE pontificating AND THE GRANDSTANDING, WE HAVE
GOT TO DO MORE. TO THE FAVREAU FAMILY AND TO EVERY MOTHER WHO
HAS BURIED THEIR CHILD... I EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. VICE-MAYOR
MALLON?
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. EXPERIENCING JUST A LOT OF
SADNESS TONIGHT. IT WAS VERY, VERY MOVING TO SEE EVERYONE AT THE
RALLY THIS EVENING, ESPECIALLY PARENTS WHO HAVE RECENTLY LOST
CHILDREN TO GUN VIOLENCE OR TO DRUG OVERDOSES. I HAD THE PLEASURE
OF KNOWING BOBBY IN HIGH SCHOOL. HE WORKED WITH ME ON A
CAMBRIDGE WEEKEND BACKPACK PROGRAM BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE
CULINARY ARTS PROGRAM AND I SAW HIM EVERY WEEK, HE WAS FUNNY, HE
WAS JUST A TRUE DELIGHT TO BE AROUND. AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO HIS
FAMILY DURING THIS REALLY DARK, DARK TIME.
I THINK THE MAYOR IS RIGHT. TIME FOR US TO LISTEN AND ALSO TIME FOR
US TO ACT. WE ARE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WHEN WE NEED TO DO
TO PROTECT OUR OWN PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE THAT NO OTHER MOM, NO
OTHER DAD, GRANDPARENT OR CARETAKER GETS THAT KNOCK ON THE DOOR
THAT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED TONIGHT HAPPENS. THE POLICE OFFICER
KNOCKS ON THE DOOR AND DELIVERS THAT NEWS. IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE
NINE OF US, INCUMBENT ON ALL CITY STAFF, INCUMBENT ON OUR NGOs IN
THE CITY, COME TOGETHER AND REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE SURE
THAT NO OTHER CAREGIVER GETS THAT KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND WE DON'T
ADD TO THAT CLUB THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS WAS DESCRIBING EARLIER.
I'M COMMITTED TO THAT. I KNOW ALL OF US HAVE BEEN MEETING AROUND
THE CLOCK AROUND WHAT TO DO. I JUST WANT TO SAY MY DEEPEST
CONDOLENCES TO BOBBY'S FAMILY. I HOPE AS A CITY WE CAN REALLY MAKE
THIS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I HAVE TO TALK MORE ABOUT
THIS LATER WHEN WE GET TO THE POLICY ORDERS. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
MUCH NOW AND CERTAINLY JUST -- COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, THANK YOU FOR
SHARING YOUR STORY AND YOUR PAIN AROUND THIS. I CAN'T IMAGINE AS
THE FATHER OF FOUR, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE.
I DIDN'T KNOW BOBBY. MY SON DID. AT THE RALLY TONIGHT, WHEN WE
WERE -- THEY WERE READING THE NAMES OF THOSE WE HAVE LOST TO
VIOLENCE IN THE CITY, I WAS REALIZED HOW MANY I DID KNOW FROM JESSIE,


PAGE 34

Aug 2 2021

MY FRIEND IN HIGH SCHOOL, STEVIE MARTIN, I WAS HIS SOCIAL WORKER,
CHARLEEN HOLMES, HER SOCIAL WORKER. AND SO MANY OTHERS. IT JUST
SHOWS WHAT A REALLY SMALL CITY WE ARE. AND THAT WE ARE ALL
TOUCHED BY THIS WHEN WE LOSE A YOUNG PERSON AND NOT SIX DEGREES
OF SEPARATION, IT IS LIKE ONE OR TWO.
I'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. HONESTLY, I'M A -- COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, YOU
THREW ME OFF. MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO BOBBY'S FAMILY. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. AS WE SEND OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
TO BOBBY'S FAMILY DURING THIS REALLY DIFFICULT TIME. ON ADOPTING THE
RESOLUTION, WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.

Resolution #11
Resolution on the death of Robert
R. “LB” Favreau, III

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO RESOLUTION 13. THANKS TO MR. BARD
FOR THE FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY AND
WISHING HIM GREAT SUCCESS AS HE ENTERS THE EXCITING NEXT CHAPTER.
THIS IS FILED BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND MYSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
JOINING TOGETHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SERVICE OF OUR COMMISSIONER
BRANVILLE BARD. I CAN PEOPLE PERSONALLY HOW I'M SADDENED HE IS
LEAVING US -- I'M JUST SAD HE IS LEAVING US. I KNOW THAT HE IS NOT
PROBABLY JOINING US BECAUSE HE IS STILL ON MEDICAL LEAVE. I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS SERVICE, THE
SACRIFICE HE MADE. HE CAME HERE TO CAMBRIDGE WHEN I WAS SITTING AS
MAYOR, I TAKE PRIDE AND OWNERSHIP FOR HIM BEING HERE. MAKING THE
GRAND SACRIFICE HIM AND HIS FAMILY TO UPROOT HIMSELF FROM
PHILADELPHIA TO COME HERE TO MASSACHUSETTS.
AND WE ALL KNOW, JULY 27TH, HE ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE LEAVING US
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE TO OUR CITY. IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT LONG,
2017, HE CAME TO JOIN US FROM PHILADELPHIA. WHILE HE WAS HERE, HIS
DEDICATION TO OUR CITY, DEDICATION TO OUR CITY WAS AS IF HE HAD BEEN
HERE LIVING AS A NATIVE CANTABRIGIAN. I ADMIRE THE DEDICATION TO THE
IDEALS OF COMMUNITY POLICING, FOSTER TRUST AND CONNECTION
BETWEEN POLICE OFFICERS OF THE -- OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE
COMMUNITY. ENGAGING IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND BRING CITY LEADERS
ALL TOGETHER.
I THOUGHT I KNOW HIS WORK IS EXTRAORDINARY. WE CALL HIM
COMMISSIONER BARD, HE IS ACTUALLY DR. BARD. A WELL EDUCATED
INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME HERE, AS YOU CAN SEE, HE COULD HAVE GONE
SOMEWHERE ELSE. CAME HERE AND LIVED AMONG US AND WORKED WITH
US. WHEN THE NATION TURNED ITS EYES TOWARD THE PROTEST ACROSS THE
COUNTRY, CALLING FOR POLICE REFORMS, WE LOOKED AT WHAT WE HAD
DONE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE, I BELIEVE AT THE TIME, SEVEN OF THE EIGHT
INITIATIVES SET FORTH BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, WE HAD ALREADY DONE
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP. AND I THINK WE ARE UP TO ALL EIGHT OF THEM. IT

PAGE 35

Aug 2 2021

IS NOT AN EASY JOB TAKING -- TAKING ON THE ROLE OF COMMISSIONER OF
THE LEADERSHIP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CITY. BUT WILLING TO NOT
ONLY TO TAKE THE JOB, TAKE THE CRITICISM, BUT MAKE THE CHANGES.
HARD CHOICES. THE OTHER THING ABOUT COMMISSIONER BARD THAT WAS
EXTRAORDINARY TO ME, HE WAS NOT JUST A ROLE MODEL. HE WAS A REAL
MODEL. HE HAD AN IMPACT ON THE LIVES, HAS AN IMPACT AND WILL
CONTINUE TO DO THIS WHEREVER HE GOES ON YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
THAT HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER GET TO KNOW OR NEVER GET TO MEET.
I JUST REMEMBER, WE WERE AT CARNIVAL ONE TIME, ONE YEAR, AND SHOTS
RANG OUT. IT DEVASTATED MY GRANDDAUGHTER, WHO IS SITTING ON THE
VIEWING STAND. AND THE WORK THAT HE -- HE WAS VERY INTENTIONAL
ABOUT CALMING HERE AND MAKING SURE THAT SHE WAS OKAY. AND I TELL
THAT STORY BECAUSE OVER THE SERIES OF THE YEARS OF HER KNOWING
HIM, SHE THINKS POLICE OFFICERS ARE ALL GO. AND I REMEMBER GOING TO
THE CITY OF BROCKTON, SHE WAS REBUFFED BY THE POLICE OFFICER. SHE
THOUGHT IT WAS OFF BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT TREATMENT HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE. AND SO, I THANK YOU FOR BEING A GOOD FAITH PARTNER
WITH OUR CITY. I THANK HIM AND THE FAMILY FOR CHOOSING CAMBRIDGE,
EVEN FOR THE SHORT TIME HE IS HERE. I WISH HIM ALL THE BEST IN THE
FUTURE ENDEAVORS AND I HOPE THIS COUNCIL WILL ADOPT THIS POLICY
ORDER SAYING TO COMMISSIONER DR. BARD, THANK YOU FOR THE SERVICE.
WE WISH YOU WELL. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE, HOWEVER,
SHORT IT MAY HAVE BEEN. AND CONGRATULATIONS GOING FORWARD. I
YIELD THE FLOOR.
ONE OTHER THING -- I WROTE MY CONNECTION. I WANT TO SUSPEND THE
RULES TO ADD COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AS A SPONSOR TO THE ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SURE. I WILL GO THROUGH EVERYBODY AND THEN WE
CAN DO -- A MOTION ON THAT. GO TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN, COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND THEN
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED TO THIS
RESOLUTION, IF POSSIBLE. I WANT TO THANKS, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY
HEART, DR. BARD FOR SHARING THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF HIS LIFE HERE.
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WITH US, IT WAS A PLEASURE AND
HONOR TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS SO COMMITTED TO
TRANSPARENCY AND TRANSFORMATIONAL JUSTICE. THERE WAS NEVER A
TIME WHERE I WENT TO HIM WHERE I SAID I HAVE THIS CRAZY IDEA AND HE
SAID, NOPE, CAN'T DO IT. CAN'T DO IT. HE WAS REALLY COMMITTED TO
MAKE SURE THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS ON THE FRONT EDGE
OF ANY TRANSFORMATIONAL POLICY. ANY TRANSPARENCY POLICY. AND LIKE
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID, THERE WOULD BE YOUNG MEN IN THE
COMMUNITY, AND YOUNG WOMEN, I THOUGHT WOULD BENEFIT FROM
SITTING WITH HIM AND TALKING TO HIM. AND HE TOOK THE CALLS. HE
MADE THE CONNECTIONS, ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS A KID. HE LOVED
CONNECTING. STILL LOVES CONNECTING WITH THE YOUTH IN THE
COMMUNITY AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE CONNECTION TO HIM


PAGE 36

Aug 2 2021

PERSONALLY.
I WILL NEVER FORGET WHEN I WAS FIRST ON THE COUNCIL, WE WERE
EXPERIENCING A ROUND OF GUN VIOLENCE IN ANOTHER JULY, AND THERE
WAS A SHOOTING ACROSS FROM -- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON. I
SAID TO HIM WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING ABOUT THIS. HOW CAN WE
MAKE SURE IT STOPS. THIS IS SO BOLD DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. HE
SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW. COME TO THE STATION, SIT WITH
THE COMMAND STAFF AND LISTEN TO THE BRIEFING AND YOU CAN HEAR
WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU CAN SEE WHAT WE ARE PLANNING. I JUST
REMEMBER BEING STUNNED. THAT TYPE OF OPEN-DOOR POLICY EXISTED. I
WAS EXPECTING SORT OF -- PLATITUDES AROUND WHAT THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT WAS DOING. THAT'S WHO HE WAS. COMMITTED TO THAT
TRANSPARENCY. COMMITTED TO CAMBRIDGE AND COMMITTED TO SOLVING
CRIMES AND KEEPING THE COMMUNITY SAFE. I WILL MISS HIM. I'M SAD TO
SEE HIM GO. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AT
JOHNS HOPKINS. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THE LEADERSHIP, HIS
PARTNERSHIP, HIS FRIENDSHIP, AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO HIS WIFE
FOR MOVING HERE, FOR PUTTING UP WITH US. MAKING SURE HE WAS
AVAILABLE TO US 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. I WISH YOU ALL THE
BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR NEW ENDEAVORS AND PLEASE DON'T BE A STRANGER.
DEEPLY, DEEPLY THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, DR. BARD,
FOR BEING HERE WITH US FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. I YIELD.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I WANT TO ECHO MY THANKS AND WISHING
THE COMMISSIONER GREAT LUCK IN HIS NEXT CHAPTER. IT IS SAD FOR US TO
SEE HIM MOVE ON. I THINK SOMETHING THAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID
ABOUT -- I REMEMBER WATCHING ALL THE NEWS STORIES ABOUT WHAT WAS
GOING TO NATIONALLY AND POLICE REFORM AND THE THINGS THAT POLICE
DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE DOING. THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE ARE DOING MOST
OF THOSE THINGS, IF NOT ALL. AND A LOT OF THAT HAPPENED IN THE FOUR
SHORT YEARS THAT COMMISSIONER BARD HAS BEEN HERE.
AND WHAT I ALWAYS APPRECIATED OR DO APPRECIATE ABOUT HIM, HE IS
PROUD OF THE WORK THAT HE HAS DONE AND IS WILLING TO DEFEND IT. HE
ALSO IS NEVER -- HE KNOWS THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE ARE NOT PERFECT. HE
KNOWS HE IS NOT PERFECT. HE KNOWS THERE'S MORE WORK FOR US TO DO.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THINGS WE CAN DO
BETTER, I THINK ABOUT THE TASK FORCE THAT -- ALTERNATIVE TO PUBLIC
SAFETY TASK FORCING, THE HOMELESS TASK FORCE, VARIOUS COMMITTEES I
HAVE BEEN ON WITH HIM, THOSE CONVERSATIONS GO DIFFERENT WITH HIM
THAN FROM HOW I HEAR THEY GO IN OTHER PLACES WHERE -- OTHER POLICE
COMMISSIONERS ARE DEFENSIVE AND UNWILLING TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR
AND MAKE CHANGES.
THAT IS NOT COMMISSIONER BARD. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT ABOUT
HIM. AND SO I WILL MISS HIM. I WILL MISS RIBBING HIM ABOUT THE
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE A LOT BETTER THAN THE
PATRIOTS THESE DAYS. MAYBE IT IS GOOD HE IS LEAVING NOW INSTEAD OF
NEXT FOOTBALL SEASON. I WILL MISS HIM. HE IS A GOOD MAN AND A GREAT


PAGE 37

Aug 2 2021

COMMISSIONER AND I WISH HIM THE BEST OF LUCK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR
NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO THANK
COMMISSIONER BARD FOR HIS SERVICE AND WHILE WE DIDN'T ALWAYS GET
ALONG, PARTICULARLY TOWARDS THE END OF HIS TENURE, IT WAS NEVER
PERSONAL FOR ME. I APPRECIATE HIM A LOT AS A PERSON. WHERE WE
DISAGREED WAS ON THE ROLE OF POLICING IN OUR SOCIETY.
UNFORTUNATELY, I DO HAVE TROUBLE WISHING HIM GREAT SUCCESS AS HE
ENTERS HIS EXCITING NEXT CHAPTER BECAUSE THAT'S TO CREATE A
BRAND-NEW POLICE DEPARTMENT AT JOHN HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ->> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE RESOLUTION, WISHING HIM
WELL. IT IS JUST NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU
DISAGREE WITH HIM.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I'M SORRY. I DISAGREE. THIS IS A RESOLUTION
THAT WE ARE VOTING ON. IT DOESN'T SAY WISH HIM WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOUR MANNERS ARE. I'M GOING
TO MOVE ON FROM YOU. THIS IS MY ZOOM CHAMBER. I JUST DON'T THINK
IT IS APPROPRIATE. YOU CAN -- YOU CAN VOTE AGAINST THE RESOLUTION.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I CAN SPEAK MY MIND ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF ORDER, MADAM MAYOR?
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: OUTRAGEOUS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I HAVE STATED WHERE I AM AND I HAVE STATED WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO. I MOVE ON TO OTHER COUNCILLORS WHO SPEAK ON THE
RESOLUTION. I HAVE COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MANY THINGS I
APPRECIATE ABOUT THE COMMISSIONER IS THAT HE WAS WILLING TO
ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A RANGE OF ISSUES, INCLUDING WHEN
THERE WAS TENSION OR MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTION OF DIFFERENT
VIEWPOINTS. I TRULY APPRECIATED THAT AND KNOW THAT IS A STRENGTH
OF A LEADER THAT IS ALL TOO RARE. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT CHANGE IS
NEEDED AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS NECESSARY.
IT TRULY IS A LEADER THAT DID THIS CITY WELL. HAS BEEN NOTED BY
COLLEAGUES BEFORE AND THAT WE WILL HAVE -- A HARD TIME FINDING
SOMEONE WHO IS ABLE TO BRING THAT TO THE CITY IN THE FUTURE. I TRULY
HAVE LOOKED FORWARD TO HAVING HIM BE INVOLVED IN THE UPCOMING
CONVERSATIONS. THERE'S A NUMBER OF THEM WE ARE HAVING AROUND
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND HE REALLY IS SOMEONE WHO BROUGHT TO
THE TABLE A PERSPECTIVE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO LISTEN. HE INVITED
PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN I THINK MANY OTHER
POLICE OFFICERS DO. MANY, MANY YEARS AGO I WORKED WITH THE POLICE


PAGE 38

Aug 2 2021

DEPARTMENTS WHEN I WORKED IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND IT
WAS REMARKABLE HOW OPEN HE WAS. I LEARNED FROM HIM AND I'M
TRULY SORRY HE IS LEAVING AND I CAN'T WORK WITH HIM IN THE FUTURE. I
WILL HIGHLIGHT WHAT VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID ABOUT HE INVITED
PEOPLE IN TO THE DEPARTMENT. UNFORTUNATELY, THREE WEEKS I WAS
ELECTED, COVID HIT AND THE OPPORTUNITY I ASKED ABOUT -- RIDING WITH
OFFICERS OR BEING MORE INVOLVED IN THE DEPARTMENT OTHER THAN ON
ZOOM WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT COULD HAPPEN DURING HIS TENURE. I
KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING HE OFFERED TO ME AS A NEW COUNCILLOR. I
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPED ME DO MY JOB BETTER. I WISH
HIM THE BEST. JOHNS HOPKINS IS LUCKY AND SORRY TO LOSE HIM AND I
APPRECIATE THE FOLKS THAT PUT THIS FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE
ADDED TO THE RESOLUTION AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND THEN COUNCILLOR
CARLONE, AND FOLLOWED BY COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS -MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN IN TERMS OF WISH
ING POLICE COMMISSIONER BARD MUCH SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE
ENDEAVORS. REALLY TO THANK HIM AND HIS FAMILY FOR DEVOTING
SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO THE RESIDENTS OF CAMBRIDGE. I THINK
EVERY PART OF THE CITY THAT ONE WOULD VISIT, IT WAS GLOWING
COMMENTARY ABOUT COMMISSIONER BARD AND HIS ACCESSIBILITY AND HIS
COMMITMENT, ESPECIALLY TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
WHAT HE DID FOR THE MORALE OF THE FORCE AND JUST BEING IN THE
COMMUNITY. HE SHOWED GREAT DETERMINATION, LEADERSHIP, AND
COMMITMENT. I PERSONALLY I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE SEE THE
COMMISSIONER LEAVE AT THIS TIME. JUDGING FROM THE COMMENTS
EARLIER, IT IS CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE WHY A CHANGE IN
COMMISSIONER -- THAT HE PROBABLY SOUGHT FOR. I JUST WANT TO END
ON A BIG THANK YOU TO THE COMMISSIONER AND HIS FAMILY FOR SERVING
THE RESIDENTS FOR THE PERIOD HE WAS HERE. HOPEFULLY, AT SOME POINT
IN THE FUTURE, HE'LL COME BACK TO THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU,
COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR CARLONE?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WILL BE FAIRLY BRIEF. MY
COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN HIGHLY OF THE COMMISSIONER AND I SHARE
THAT POINT OF VIEW. WE MET HIM EARLY IN THE INTERVIEW -- WELL
MID-WAY THROUGH THE INTERVIEW PROCESS. A FEW OF THE COUNCILLORS
WHO ARE STILL ON THE COUNCIL. HONESTLY, CAN I SAY I THINK WE WERE
ALL IMPRESSED WITH HIS STRENGTH AND HIS HUMANITY. HE COULD JOKE
ABOUT HIMSELF IN THAT FIRST MEETING. I THOUGHT -- WOW, THIS IS A
SPECIAL GUY. NOTHING HAS CHANGED THAT OPINION. OF COURSE, THERE
ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND SOME WERE
DISCUSSED EARLIER TONIGHT. IT IS RARE WHEN YOU FIND THAT KIND OF
STRENGTH AND A GENTLENESS AT THE SAME TIME TOWARD PEOPLE. A
FRIENDLY NESS AND WE WILL MISS HIM, BUT HE WAS OFFERED A

PAGE 39

Aug 2 2021

TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T KEEP THE TEAM.
SO WE MOVE FORWARD. AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BUILD ON HIS RECORD.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER?
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. SIMILAR
TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN, I OVERLAPPED WITH COMMISSIONER BARD FOR
JUST MORE THAN A YEAR, MOST IS ON ZOOM. AND IT HAS BEEN A REALLY
CRAZY YEAR TO BE IN AN EXECUTIVE POSITION IN CITY GOVERNMENT. WE
HAD A COUPLE OF OTHER DEPARTURES IN SCHOOL, PUBLIC HEALTH, I CAN
IMAGINE -- BETWEEN THE PANDEMIC AND ALL OF THE CHANGING
SITUATIONS THROUGHOUT AND IN BETWEEN THE PROTESTS AROUND RACIAL
JUSTICE AND POLICING, THE CHALLENGES OF THE PEACE, WE APPRECIATE THE
TIME HERE AND WISH HIM WELL IN BALTIMORE AND NEXT STEPS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I'LL ADD MY FINAL COMMENTS AND SAY...
COMMISSIONER BARD ALWAYS HAD OPEN-DOOR POLICY. ALWAYS PICKED UP
THE PHONE. AND IT WAS REALLY GREAT GETTING TO KNOW HIM. HE'S LEFT
A LOT OF THINGS BEHIND THAT WILL CONTINUE, THE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE
SECTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE WORK RELATED TO THAT. YES, I THINK -BALTIMORE, JOHNS HOPKINS, THEY ARE LUCKY AND I'M REALLY GOING TO
MISS COMMISSIONER BARD. WE'LL ADD -- MOTION TO ADD COUNCILLOR
NOLAN, MOTION TO ADD VICE-MAYOR MALLON ->> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: MYSELF TOO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL ADD COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, VICE-MAYOR
MALLON, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND THEN WE'LL ADD COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: BEFORE WE -- TO CLOSE IT OUT, AGAIN I JUST
WANT TO SAY ABOUT ONE THING ABOUT DR. BARD. HE WAS THE EPITOME
OF BEING A GENTLEMAN. NO MATTER HOW INCONSIDERATE AND IMPOLITE
PEOPLE WOULD BE, HE WOULDN'T RETURN IT. THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
FEATURE. SOMETHING WE ALL COULD MODEL OURSELVES AFTER. HE
WASN'T JUST A ROLE MODEL, HE WAS A REALLY MODEL. AS A SCHOLAR, A
GENTLEMAN, TO YOU COMMISSIONER BARD, IF YOU ARE LISTENING, WE
PRESENT YOU WITH THE ROSES AND WITH THOSE ROSES THERE WILL BE
SOME THORNS. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOUR WIFE AND YOUR
DAUGHTER, WE DIDN'T MENTION GRACIE -- WHEN HE CAME, THEY CAME
WITH HIM AND THEY MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE TO DO THAT. WE WISH
YOU WELL AND IN THE WORDS OF ROBERT FROST -- HOME IS WHEN YOU GO
THERE, THEY HAVE TO LET YOU IN. I HOPE YOU WILL ALWAYS COME BACK,
AND I, I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF, ALWAYS WILLING TO LET HIM IN. THANK
YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. ROLL CALL ON ADDING COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN, VICE-MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, AND THEN
COUNCILLOR CARLONE.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: DID YOU FORGET ME? I WAS THE FIRST ONE.

PROGRAM. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR, FOUNDED BY FOUR EMPLOYEES, ALL
YOU HEARD FROM IN PUBLIC COMMENT. THEY WANT TO CREATE A STRONG
SUPPORTIVE PROGRAM FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AT CAMBRIDGE UPPER
SCHOOL, PROVIDED COMMUNITY MENTORS, SPEAKERS, FOOD AND FUN FOR
6-8 GRADERS. IT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THEY OPEN UP DURING THE
PANDEMIC TO THREE OTHER MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND IT TOOK OFF. THIS IS
FOUR TIMES AS LARGE WHEN IT STARTED AND THE FOUNDERS, HAVE USING

THEIR OWN FUNDS TO PUT THE EVENTS ON. AND RELYING ON STRANGERS
TO PURCHASE ITEMS AND DONATE TIME. MAYOR SIDDIQUI AND MYSELF AND
WITH THE INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT, SPENT THE DAY WITH THE TEAM AND
OVER 100 MIDDLE SCHOOLERS THIS PAST WEEKEND. THE COMMUNITY
MENTORS ON SITE, ALL OF WHOM KNEW THE KIDS BY NAME ALREADY, SPENT
THE FOUR HOURS GETTING TO KNOW EACH ONE. I HAD A WHOLE SPEECH
PLAN ABOUT WHY TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM, BUT WE RECEIVED AN EMAIL
FROM THE MOM OF A PARTICIPATING STUDENT THAT SUMMED IT UP BETTER
THAN I COULD. SHE SAID, CAMBRIDGE YOUTH ARE STRUGGLING WITH
MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN VIOLENCE IS INCREASING. WE NEED PROGRAMS
LIKE FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE THAT FUNCTION AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE THAT
SUPPORTS OUR YOUTH AND PROVIDES THEM A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP AND
MONITORSHIPS THAT HELP TO GUIDE THEM. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT
ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THE CITY, WE MUST
SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE DOING THAT DEEP AND MEANINGFUL
WORK OF ENGAGING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE
ENVIRONMENT. FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE LED BY THE TEAM IS DOING THAT WORK
AND WE SHOULD THEREBY TO SUPPORT THEM 100%. I HOPE THAT OUR
COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US AND SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM, SENDING A
STRONG MESSAGE TO THE CITY MANAGER, BUT TO THE COMMUNITY THAT
WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE YOUTH IN OUR CITY. I WILL YIELD BACK AT THIS
TIME. I WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT HYPE
SHOULD ANY COLLEAGUE HAVE THEM. THANK YOU AND I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN I SEE
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY'S HAND AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN. YOU ARE
MUTED.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: WONDERFUL SPEECH -- COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, IT
IS MY TURN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE FLOOR. I WAS
PLEASED AND HONORED TO COSPONSOR THIS POLICY ORDER. WE TALK
ABOUT CITY SOLUTIONS TO CITY PROBLEMS, USING ORGANIC, FROM THE
GROUND UP, INDIVIDUALS WHO TOO OFTEN HAVE TO GO INTO THEIR OWN
POCKET BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THE JOB AND MAKE IT
HAPPEN, THEY SAY I WON'T WAIT FOR YOU TO DO -- TAKE THIS MEASURE AND
SAVE OUR KIDS. TO RAISE THEM UP, TO LIFT THEM UP AND GIVE THEM THE
POSITIVE OPPORTUNITIES. I'M EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD OF THE
ORGANIZERS, BUT I'M AS EQUALLY PROUD TO SAY COLLECTIVELY WITH OUR
VOICES AND WITH OUR DOLLARS WE SUPPORT YOU. WE WANT YOU TO
MOVE THIS FORWARD AS WE TRY TO WRAP A SECURITY BLANKET OR A
SAFETY NET AROUND THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO THEY CAN HAVE THE RICH AND
WONDERFUL FUTURES THEY DESERVE.
I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT THIS ORDER. I WANT TO THANK
VICE-MAYOR MALLON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND I HOPE THAT WE
WILL UNANIMOUSLY VOTE TO PASS THIS AND THEN WORK TOWARD TO MAKE
SURE IT IS IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK VICE-MAYOR
MALLON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS. SHE IS A BIG PROPONENT AND


PAGE 43

Aug 2 2021

SUPPORTER OF THIS PROGRAM FOR A LONG TIME. AND I DO WANT TO -- THE
BIGGEST THANKS IS TO THE DEBBIE AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO IS RUNNING
THE PROGRAM. THIS IS AS WE WERE AT THE VIGIL TODAY AND LISTEN TO
FOLKS, THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING WE NEED TO DO. IT IS DIRECT
INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY CARE DEEPLY, THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE THAT CARE DEEPLY, BUT REALLY KNOW THE KIDS AND GET INTO -JUST GET IN DEEP WITH THEM AND THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND
CREATE A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS GOING TO PASS. I HOPE THAT -- AS WE HEARD IN
PUBLIC COMMENT, THIS IS SOMETHING SHOULD BE FUNDED ON AN
ONGOING BASIS, NOT JUST WITH A LITTLE MONEY TO KEEP THEM GOING.
SOMETHING TO SUPPORT AND MAYBE SOMETHING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
MODELLING IN OTHER PLACES AND EXPANDING.
AND SO, -- SOME POINT SOON, I WILL SAY. ALTHOUGH, DEBBIE AND OTHERS
MAY CURSE ME NOW THAT I WANT THEM TO DO MORE. THIS IS A FABULOUS
PROGRAM. AND MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE
NEED. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I CONQUER WITH MY COLLEAGUES.
THERE ARE OTHER CLUBS AS WELL. THERE'S A SMALLER PROGRAM THAT
GETS A LITTLE CITY MONEY. I WISH IT GOT MORE, IT IS CALLED "MATH CLUB."
IT HELPS KIDS OF VARIED BACKGROUNDS SORT OF EXCELLING IN MATH AND
NOT FEARING IT. MY WIFE AND I WERE PART OF SAY YES TO EDUCATION, IT
WAS SET UP DIFFERENTLY. THAT EXTRA ATTENTION OF AFTER-SCHOOL
SUMMER PROGRAMS, JUST CARING FOR KIDS, IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE THEIR LIVES. THIS WAS THE ONLY HARRINGTON SCHOOL, WHICH HAD
THE LOWEST SCORES AT THE TIME.
ATTENTION MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. AND ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW
THE PROGRAM IN DETAIL, I TOTALLY BELIEVE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND
WRITTEN. THIS SHOULD BE AS VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID, UNANIMOUS
SUPPORT. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. ALL OF YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: VERY QUICK. I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT ANYTHING.
I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO BROUGHT IT FORWARD AND ALSO THIS IS NOT
ONLY THE PROGRAM WE SHOULD SUPPORT, AS VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID,
THEY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD AND EXACTLY THE THING WE SHOULD
RELY ON. WHEN WE LOOK AT PROGRAMS, SO MANY OF THEM HAVE A
PROVEN TRACK RECORD AND IF IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE TO UPLIFT AND
EXPAND AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REPLICATE IT OR MOVE FORWARD
ON THAT. IT IS THE RARE PROGRAM, IF IT ISN'T WORKING, WE HAVE TO
READJUST. IT IS WORKING SO WELL AND WE NEED TO EXPAND IT AND
PROVIDE FUNDING. IT SAYS A STEADY SOURCE OF FUNDING, NOT JUST A
ONE-TIME THING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I THINK WE HEARD OF THIS IN PUBLIC
COMMENT. I THINK WE MAKE IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO DO THIS WORK. WE
NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER. THIS IS ONE STEP FORWARD. THANK YOU TO
VICE-MAYOR MALLON FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND REALLY HAPPY TO BE


PAGE 44

Aug 2 2021

A PART OF IT AS WELL. WE CAN DO A ROLL CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: MAKING IT UNANIMOUS?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MAKING IT UNANIMOUS.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION, MAKING THE POLICY ORDER UNANIMOUS
UPON ADOPTION?
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.

Policy Order #1
That the City Manager is
requested to confer with the
Department of Human Service
Programs, the Peace
Commission, and other relevant
City departments to explore the
feasibility of providing Equity
Roadmap with regular funding
for Friday Night Hype.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER THREE.
(READING POLICY ORDER NUMBER 3). I WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THIS.
THIS IS SPONSORED BY MYSELF, VICE-MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN, AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I WILL THANK MICHELLE, XAVIER'S
MOM. IT IS SO SAD THAT WE ARE HERE AT THIS POINT TO BE DEDICATING A
STREET CORNER TO A YOUNG MAN WE HAVE LOST IN OUR COMMUNITY.
ANOTHER HOLE WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE WANT HIS MEMORY TO
LIVE ON. AND THERE IS SO MUCH WORK BY ESTABLISHING A SCHOLARSHIP
FUND. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ALSO DEDICATE A PART OF
CAMBRIDGE THAT WILL LIVE ON IN XAVIER'S MEMORY. I REALLY LOOK
FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE DEDICATION COMMITTEE DECIDES. AGAIN,
JUST WANT TO THANK RACHELLE FOR SPEAKING TONIGHT AND EVERYTHING
SHE HAS DONE IN THE WAKE OF THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY. WE ARE HERE TO
SUPPORT HER. I SEE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND THEN VICE-MAYOR
MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK YOU,
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, VICE-MAYOR MALLON, FOR STANDING AND
OFFERING THIS ORDER TO MEMORIALIZE XAVIER LOUIS -- I'M SAYING THE
NAME WRONG. I APOLOGIZE. I SEE THIS MEMORIAL AS A LITTLE MORE THAN
JUST REMEMBERING WHO HE IS OR WAS, BUT NOT FORGETTING WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM.
ONE THING THAT WE DON'T DO WELL ON THE MEMORIALS, MAYBE IT IS
ANOTHER ORDER AT ANOTHER TIME, A TESTIMONY, SOME STORY OR QR
CODE WHERE PEOPLE CAN READ AND KNOW MORE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL
WE ARE ACKNOWLEDGING. THE MOM WHO HAS JOINED THE ORDER OF THE
WAILING WOMEN, I REFER TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE IN MOURNING ABOUT

PAGE 45

Aug 2 2021

THE LOSS OF SOMEONE CLOSE TO THEM. I HAVE SAID IT EARLIER AND SAY IT
AGAIN. MAYBE I WILL KEEP SAYING IT UNTIL SOMETHING DIFFERENT. NO
MOTHER SHOULD BURY HER OWN CHILD. I STAND IN MY COLLEAGUES, IN
THE MEMORIAL OF WHO HE WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE EVEN THOUGH HE
IS NOT PRESENT AND AMONGST US. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS MEMORIAL,
THIS TESTIMONY TO HIS LIFE, WE ARE FORCED TO RECKON WITH SHOULD WE
HAVE NOT SOLVED AND CEASE THIS MADNESS. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO DO.
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER XAVIER OR MR. FAVREAU, THEIR NAMES WERE
MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE PROTEST.
I STAND WITH EACH OF YOU, MY COLLEAGUES, IN TESTIMONY AND IN
SUPPORT OF THIS ORDER. I JUST HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT WE WILL NOT
HAVE TO PUT UP SIGNS TO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST
THEIR LIVES FAR TOO EARLY. I YIELD.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW TO BEST HONOR XAVIER'S MEMORY AND
THE LOSS OF THE YOUNG MAN. I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. I WAS
SO MOVED BY HIS MOM SPEAKING ON THE STEPS OF CITY HALL EARLIER. JUST
BEING SO ANGRY. I WOULD BE TOO. MY HEART JUST GOES OUT TO ALL -- I
FEEL LIKE -- I'M GLAD WE TALK ABOUT THIS SO MANY TIMES TONIGHT. IT
DESERVES TO BE TALKED ABOUT, THE GUN VIOLENCE AND THE LOSS OF
YOUNG PEOPLE, THE DEVASTATION OF THE FAMILIES AND THE RIPPLE EFFECT,
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY MEETING. IT IS HARD. I'M GLAD WE
ARE DOING IT TONIGHT. I'M GLAD WE'RE COMMITTED TO HONORING
XAVIER'S MEMORY AND MAKE SURE NOBODY FORGETS HE DIED THERE,
BEHIND THE PEABODY SCHOOL AT THE BASKETBALL COURTS. ONE THING HIS
MOM SAID, SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE CITY TO DEDICATE A
SCHOLARSHIP TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY FOR ANY
OF THE KIDS. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HONORING HIS MEMORY, THIS IS
A BIG IMPORTANT STEP. WE SHOULD DO MORE. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
ALL THE WAYS WE NEED TO SHOW UP FOR OUR KIDS. ESPECIALLY -- KIDS LIKE
XAVIER. HE WAS GOING OFTEN. HAD THE WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF HIM. HE
WAS -- WE SHOULD SUPPORT THE KIDS, THEIR DREAMS AND ENDEAVORS.
THIS IS ONE SMALL WAY, AS A COUNCIL, WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR THE
FAMILY TO HONOR THE MEMORY, AND WE HAVE TO ENDEAVOR TO FIGURE
OUT OTHER WAYS TO HAVE THAT RIPPLE EFFECT IN A POSITIVE WAY
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO US COMING
TOGETHER TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS WITH OUR
COMMUNITY AND MAKE A REALLY POSITIVE LASTING IMPACT OUT OF A
REALLY HORRIBLE SITUATION. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD
AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME BE A PART OF IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ABSOLUTELY. WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL ON THE POLICY
ORDER.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE ORDER: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER FOUR. ADDRESSING
THE INCREASED GUN ACTIVITY. COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, YOU HAVE THE

That the Executive Assistant to
the City Council confer with the
Dedication Committee to
designate a suitable street corner,
square or the Pemberton
Basketball Courts in honor of

Aug 2 2021

FLOOR?
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY ON
ANOTHER POLICY ORDER I TALK ABOUT THE WAILING WOMEN AND I WILL
BRING YOU BACK FOR A MOMENT. JEREMIAH 9, WAILING WOMEN ARE THE
ONES WHO VOICE THE PAIN AND WHOSE LAMENTS SERVE AS A MEMORY OF
WHAT AND WHO WERE LOST. WHEN I TALK ABOUT WAILING WOMEN, I TALK
ABOUT MOSTLY MOTHERS AND I KNOW THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
SHORT -- NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRIEF OF MEN AND SIBLINGS. WAILING
WOMEN ARE THE ONES THAT SAID, BROUGHT ATTENTION TO WHAT HAD
HAPPENED WITH THE LOSS WAS. THIS POLICY ORDER YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF
YOU, IT IS SPEAKING TO HOW DO WE STOP THAT LOSS.
YOU KNOW, IT PAINS AND FRUSTRATES ME, MADAM MAYOR, TO SAY THAT
EVEN JUST AS THIS PAST WEEKEND AS I WAS REVIEWING TONIGHT'S AGENDA,
THERE ARE REPORTS OF MORE GUN SHOTS IN THE PORT. CLEARLY, WHAT WE
ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THE RECENT WAVE OF GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT
WORKING. IT'S NOT WORKING, LEAVING PEOPLE FRIGHTENED, SCARED,
ANGRY. ONE OF THE SHOTS FIRED A FEW DAYS AGO WAS IN THE HOUSE THAT
IS OWNED BY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY FOR OVER 50 YEARS. THE
SHOTS WENT RIGHT THROUGH THEIR HOUSE. WHERE THEIR CHILDREN ARE.
SOME CASES, AS WITH XAVIER, AND ROBERT FAVREAU, IT CLAIMS PEOPLE'S
LIVES AND ALSO CLAIMING PEOPLE'S COMFORT. THEIR SENSE OF SECURITY.
THEIR FEELING OF BEING SAFE. THIS IS CLEARLY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND
WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT AS AN UNDENIABLE STATE OF EMERGENCY.
I APPRECIATE IT AND I UNDERSTAND THE THREATS THAT WE HAVE COMING
FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT, THIS IS AN
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. AN ENVIRONMENT OF PEOPLE FEELING UNSAFE.
PEOPLE THAT WANT AND LOVE THIS COMMUNITY, THE PORT, RIVER SIDE,
NORTH CAMBRIDGE, LIVING ON TENDER HOOKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
WHEN THE NEXT SHOT WILL BE FIRED.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE MYSELF CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THIS, I'M IN THE WORDS -I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO
TAKE CONCRETE ACTIONS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT
THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES LIVE IN.
I WANT TO THANK MY COSPONSORS, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, MAYOR
SIDDIQUI, VICE-MAYOR MALLON, FOR RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED A
MULTI-PRONG APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS GUN VIOLENCE. WE NEED TO
COME TOGETHER AND NOT PULL APART, PULL IN THE SAME DIRECTION TO
IDENTIFY PROGRAMS, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES THAT WILL CHANGE THIS.
WE CAN DO IT! WE HAVE THE MONEY. I HAVE TO BEGIN TO ASK DO WE
HAVE THE DESIRE?
WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO GET THE GUNS OFF OUR STREETS. WE ALSO
HAVE TO WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IN
SOMERVILLE, BECAUSE THE ISSUE SEEMS SO CLOSELY TIED TO THE CYCLE OF
VIOLENCE. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE WORK FROM OUR DA, SHE HAS
DEPLOYED THE RESOURCES SHE HAS DEPLOYED TO INTERVENE IN THIS RASH


PAGE 47

Aug 2 2021

OF VIOLENCE. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. WE HAVE TO GO SO MUCH
FURTHER. WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS GUN
ACTIVITY AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY.
WE NEED TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING ISSUES. WE NEED PROGRAMMING FOR
MEN AND WOMEN, 18-35 THAT WE SEEM TO MISS. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAFE STREET MEETINGS. WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME
ACTION. WE NEED TO OFFER PEOPLE A DIFFERENT PATH THAT IS -- THAN THE
DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE PATH THEY ARE ON NOW. WE HAVE TO
MAKE A SUSTAINED EFFORT, WE ARE NOT PUTTING A BAND-AID ON THE
PROBLEM AND CALMING THEM DOWN ONLY TO HAVE THEM RE-ERUPT IN
THE SPRING AND SUMMER. I WILL NOTE, WE NEED TO BE WILLING TO BE
BOLD.
IF WE THINK THAT WE -- IF WE THINK WE CAN AND SHOULD IMPROVE THE
SITUATION, WE SHOULD ACT SO. YEARS AGO, THINGS WERE SO BAD IN THE
PORT I CALLED THE CITY TO SHUT DOWN A PARK FOR THE SUMMER. JUST TO
MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THE BAD ACTORS TO HAVE A PLACE TO
CONGREGATE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I TOOK A HIT FOR DOING THAT. AND
I WILL ABSOLUTELY TAKE THAT HIT AGAIN IF THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO GIVE
SPACE AND PLACE SO WE CAN CHANGE OUR TRAJECTORY.
I'M WILLING TO BE LABELED THE BAG GUY IF IT MEANS WE'LL SAFE A LIFE. I'LL
WILLING TO BE LABELED THE BAD GUY IF IT BRINGS CALM TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OR OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. I'M WILLING TO BE THE BAD
GUY IF IT MEANS THAT WE WILL HAVE A -- COMMUNITIES THAT IS SAFE FROM
GUNSHOTS AND IT MEANS THAT NO ONE OF US WILL GET THAT PHONE CALL
SAYING THAT ANOTHER INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED. I'M WILLING TO BE THE
BAD GUY. IF WE NO LONGER HAVE TO CALL MOTHERS AND FAMILIES UP TO
TELL THEM THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHILD. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK
AND TIRED. YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE PEOPLE OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE
PORT, PEOPLE IN RIVERSIDE AND NORTH CAMBRIDGE ARE TIRED. ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH. I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS ORDER AND LET'S DO
WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO GET THE JOB DONE AS YOU HAVE HEARD
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, WE HAVE JOINED FORCES. MARK HAS BEEN AN
ALLY IN THE SAFE STREET MEETINGS. WE'LL HAVE THIS VIGIL COMING UP
SOON. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE NEED ALL OF US TOGETHER, SCHOOL
COMMITTEE MEMBERS INCLUDED, ADMINISTRATION, JOINING THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, MAKING SURE THEY KNOW THAT WE ARE SERIOUS AND
WE'LL NOT REST UNTIL WE BRING PIECE AND CALM TO OUR
NEIGHBORHOODS AND TO NEIGHBORHOOD AND CITIES. I YIELD THE FLOOR.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU AND THANK YOU COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS. I'LL BE THE BAD GUY ALONG SIDE YOU. I WON'T NAME THE
PUBLIC HOUSING -- WHERE I WAS THIS WEEKEND, BUT ONE THING THAT
STRUCK ME, ON THIS BEAUTIFUL WEEKEND WEATHER-WISE, THERE WASN'T
ONE KID OUT PLAYING IN THE PLAYGROUND. NOT A SINGLE ONE.


PAGE 48

Aug 2 2021

AND WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH FOLKS, THEY ARE SCARED. THEY ARE
SCARED. AND WE HEARD SOME INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE STATEMENTS
TODAY. I THANK EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY WHO SPOKE. WHAT GOT ME WAS
SOMETHING THAT FORMER MAYOR SAID, IF THE SHOOTINGS WERE
HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, WE'D SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN IN
CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CITY. WE HAVE TO STOP LOOKING AT THIS
AS -- THESE ARE TROUBLED FOLKS WHO HAVE A TOUGH LIVE. THESE ARE
FOLKS THAT -- THIS IS JUST IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITY OR CERTAIN
NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ARE A SMALL CITY. SMALL, SMALL CITY.
AND THE THING THAT GIVES ME HOPE, I HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE, WE ARE A
SMALL CITY WITH TREMENDOUS RESOURCES. ANY CITY CAN MAKE PROGRESS
IN THE AREAS THAT ARE PLAGUING CITIES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, IT IS
US. THE THING THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT, WE'RE A SMALL CITY ABOUT
TREMENDOUS RESOURCES AND WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT PROGRESS. AND
WHY?
AND SO, I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO -- THIS IS GOING TO BE AS WE
OFTEN DO, I HOPE WE LOOK AT SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS.
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS
PLAGUING CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THE EASE IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN
GET GUNS IS ABSURD, EVEN HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS WITH OUR STRICT
LAWS. KIDS USE VENMO NOW, GUNS LEFT IN THE PLAYGROUND AND THE
KIDS GO TO PICK IT UP. WE HAVE ISSUES BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS AND
ISSUES THAT CROSS CITY LINES. AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID.
ANOTHER THING WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED, WE HAVE -- JUST TO PUT IT ALL
ON THE TABLE. WE HAVE LEGITIMATE GANGS FORMING IN CAMBRIDGE. IT IS
NOT JUST A LOOSE GROUP OF KIDS THAT HANG OUT TOGETHER. THERE ARE
NATIONAL GANGS THAT RECRUIT KIDS IN THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THIS HAS
HIT HOME, IT HAS COME HOME. THIS IS GOING TO INVOLVE THE SCHOOLS.
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE HAD OCCUPATIONAL EDUCATION, KIDS
CANNOT -- THEY BECOME MECHANICS, ELECTRICIANS AND PLUMBERS. THEY
BECAME CARPENTERS AND WENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT INTO UNIONS
AND INTO TRADE. WE ABANDONED THAT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE SEND
OUR KIDS TO MINUTEMAN. WE DIDN'T BRING BACK FULLY THE SOLID,
WELL-PAYING LABOR JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE ACCESS
TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. THIS IS ANOTHER COMMENT MADE, AT GRADUATION,
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, WE CELEBRATE AND SHOULD THE KIDS THAT GO
TO HARVARD, YALE, AND IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. BUT WE DON'T CELEBRATE
THE KIDS WHO TAKE ANOTHER ROUTE. I HAD TO FIGHT LIKE CRAZY TO GET
THE UNIONS TO BE INVITED TO COLLEGE NIGHT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. IT IS
COLLEGE NIGHT, WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THE TRADES. THEY ARE GOOD
JOBS FOR A LOT OF KIDS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IT HAS TO START YOUNG. IT HAS TO GO
STRAIGHT THROUGH, AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID. FOLKS OVER 30,
INVOLVE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. PEOPLE -- YOUNG PEOPLE BEING RELEASED
FROM JAIL WITH NOTHING BUT MONEY TO GET ON THE BUS AND A KICK IN
THE PANTS. THEY COME BACK WITHOUT SKILLS. I WAS AMAZED TO HEAR


PAGE 49

Aug 2 2021

THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE DOESN'T SHARE WITH THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, WE
CAN'T GET THE INFORMATION OF RESIDENTS BEING RELEASED TO REACH OUT
AND HELP THEM. THAT'S A BUREAUCRATIC BS. THAT'S GOT TO CHANGE.
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS AS EVERYBODY
SAID. WE CANNOT LOSE ANYBODY ELSE.
I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR BEING THE LEAD SPONSOR AND FOR REALLY
BEING THE DRIVING FORCING TO MAKE SURE WE PUT THIS ON THE AGENDA
AND REALLY START LOOKING AT THIS IN A HOLISTIC WAY. I THINK ONE THING
THAT STRUCK ME AT THE SAFE STREETS MEETING LAST WEEK, THE PLEA
FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO REALLY -- FOR US TO UNDERSTAND AND
START SAYING AND NAMING, WE HAVE FAILED A LOT OF THE KIDS. WE
REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE GUN VIOLENCE,
WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BREAK THE CYCLE. WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS, TALK
ABOUT RE-ENTRY PROGRAMS, AND THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN THE CITY
THAT MAY NOT WORK FOR THE KIDS WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT.
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT CHECKING OUR FEELINGS AT THE DOOR AND
LEAVE OUR -- FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THE KIDS.
THESE ARE ALL OUR KID. SOMEONE SAID IT TONIGHT, ALL OF OUR KIDS, MY
KIDS, YOUR KIDS, THEY ARE THE SAME KIDS. WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL
OUR KIDS AND THAT IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF US TO COME TOGETHER
AND PULL AT THE ROPE THE SAME WAY. WE NEED TO JUST MAKE SURE WE
ARE SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE, WE ARE LASER-FOCUSSED, HAD IS THE
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND WE ALL NEED TO DO THIS TOGETHER. THE
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, SCHOOL DEPARTMENT, CBOs IN THE
COMMUNITY, WHO ARE WE COMING TOGETHER FOR, IT IS OUR KIDS. THIS
POLICY ORDER REALLY ASKS FOR THAT MEETING BETWEEN CAMBRIDGE AND
SOMERVILLE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. IT IS
ASKING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR THOSE IMPACTED BY GUN
VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA. ASKING FOR MEETING WITH THE CITY RESIDENTS
TO FIND OUT WHERE THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT ARE MISSING AND
LACKING. LASTLY, TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PROGRAM FOR THE
18-30-YEAR-OLDS THAT WE KNOW, WE KNOW NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT
FROM US, FROM THE CITY, AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. I LIKE THIS POLICY
ORDER IS VERY ACTION ORIENTED. IT IS VERY CONCISE. IT IS A ROADMAP OF
WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IT IS A STARTING POINT. THANK YOU TO
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR STARTING US OFF ON THIS PATH IN SUCH A
POSITIVE WAY AND AN ACTION-ORIENTED WAY. I'M READY TO GET TO WORK.
I WILL YIELD. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR WORKING ON THIS WITH
US.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR NOLAN.


PAGE 50

Aug 2 2021

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES
WHO HAVE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND HAVE SPOKEN SO ELOQUENTLY TO
IT. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE DIRECTION OF THE POLICY ORDER,
ESPECIALLY THE INVESTMENT IT IS PROPOSING IN SUPPORTING OUR YOUNG
MEN. IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT VIOLENCE IS ALMOST ALWAYS
COMMITTED BY YOUNG MEN, WHO THEMSELVES BEEN TRAUMATIZED IN
THEIR LIVES.
I APPRECIATE COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE OF OUR CHILDREN WHO DO NOT END UP GOING
TO IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS. TOO OFTEN, THOSE ARE THE ONLY OPTIONS FOR
BLACK AND BROWN YOUNG MEN IN THE CITY. WHILE THE RECENT UPTICK IN
SHOOTINGS IS VERY CONCERNING, IT IS NOTHING NEW. GUN VIOLENCE HAS
BEEN WORSE. AND WE ARE SEEING THE RESULTS AND HAVE BEEN SEEING
THE RESULTS FOR DECADES. WAR ON DRUGS. SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE, I
MENTIONED THIS BEFORE, I STRUGGLE TO KEEP MY OWN SON SAFE IN
CAMBRIDGE AND ULTIMATELY HAVE TO SEND HIM OUT OF CAMBRIDGE TO
KEEP HIM SAFE.
WHILE WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, AGAIN IT SHOWS
THAT WE'RE FAILING TOO MANY OF OUR YOUNG ADULTS IN CAMBRIDGE BY
NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH GOOD ALTERNATIVES. THIS PROBLEM IS WAY
DEEPER THAN GUN VIOLENCE PER SE.
WE ARE ALSO SEEING AN EPIDEMIC OF DRUG OVERDOSES AND THAT WAS
MENTIONED AT THE RALLY EARLIER TODAY AS WELL. I GOT A VERY DIFFICULT
PHONE CALL WITH A MOTHER OF ONE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DIED
RECENTLY OF A DRUG OVERDOSE JUST LAST WEEK.
ONE THING WE NEED TO DO IS THE HEART PROGRAM AND I'M GLAD TO SEE
THAT IS MEETING FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND ONE THING I
THINK WE SHOULD NOT DO IS TO INVEST IN INCREASED POLICING. AT
COMMUNITY MEETING, A WEEK OR SO AGO, IT WAS SAID THAT INCREASING
THE POLICE PRESENCE DOESN'T CHANGE THE OUTCOME. THE SHOOTINGS
TAKE PLACE SOMETIMES IN FULL VIEW OF THE POLICE PRESENCE. AND WE
HEARD SEVERAL ANECDOTES ABOUT THAT AS WELL.
I REALLY, REALLY DO SUPPORT THIS POLICY ORDER AND THE DIRECTION IT IS
HEADING, I DO WANT TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE SECOND -EXCUSE ME. THE FIRST ORDERED, WHICH IS CALLING FOR AN INCREASE IN
POLICING IN OUR CITY. THAT IS A FAILED POLICY. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BE PERPETUATING THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN HAS OFFERED THAT
AMENDMENT. BEFORE I GO BACK TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, I WILL GO TO
COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN YOU. OKAY? COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WASN'T INTENDING TO SPEAK TO THE
AMENDMENT. OKAY. I DO WANT TO ECHO THE THANKS OF MY COLLEAGUES
TO COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND MAYOR
SIDDIQUI AND VICE-MAYOR MALLON. AND ALSO, TO ALL THE MANY
ACTIVISTS THAT GATHERED BEFORE TONIGHT'S MEETING TO RALLY FOR THE

PAGE 51

Aug 2 2021

YOUTH. I WAS MOVED BY THE WORD THE SPOKEN OF THE PARENTS, YOUNG
PEOPLE, PEOPLE THAT WORK ACROSS THE CITY ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON.
THE UPTICK IS ALARMING AND TRAGIC. WE KNOW THAT, WE ALSO KNOW,
THIS IS WHAT THE POLICY ORDER CALLS FOR, WE NEED IMMEDIATE ACTION.
WE NEED LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS. AND ONE OF THE STRENGTHS I THINK OF
THE POLICY ORDER IS THAT IT RECOGNIZES BOTH AND IT IS CONCRETE AND
CLEAR ABOUT PROVIDING A ROADMAP TO THOSE SOLUTIONS. SHORT-TERM
AND LONG-TERM ARE NECESSARY AND WE NEED TO SEE BOTH OF THEM IN
PLACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF WE'LL PROTECT THE YOUTH IN CAMBRIDGE.
WE HAVE SAID IT, IT CANNOT BE SAID ENOUGH, THERE'S NOTHING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN MAKING SURE THE YOUTH ARE CARED FOR, THEY ARE
SAFE, AND THEY FEEL SAFE. RIGHT NOW, THEY DON'T. AND FAR TOO MANY
AREAS OF THE CITY. THE IMPACTS ON MENTAL HEALTH FROM THE CRISIS OF
GUN VIOLENCE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. THERE IS NO QUESTION THIS
ENTIRE COUNCIL AND THE CITY BELIEVES THE STEPS LAID OUT IN THE ORDER
ARE IMPERATIVE, BUT LET'S PASS IT AND THEN IT IS THE WORK OF ENSURING
THE IMPLEMENTATION IS THERE. WE ARE SMALL AND ENOUGH IS SAID.
THERE IS NO YOUNG PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN ADULT WHO IS
LOOKING OUT FOR THEM, WHO IS IN TOUCH WITH THEM, WHO MAKES SURE
THEY DO GET THAT CALL, THEY DO GET THAT PROGRAM, WE HAVE SO MANY
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE NEED -- AGAIN, WE ARE SMALL ENOUGH
EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON IN ANY AGE GROUP SHOULD HAVE ACCESS,
SHOULD HAVE AN ADULT MENTOR. NOBODY SHOULD FALL THROUGH THE
WAY -- THE KIDS ARE AND THEY ARE ALL OUR KIDS. WE NEED PROGRAMS
AND WE NEED A WAY TO HOLD OURSELVES, THE LEADERS, THE PROGRAM
DEVELOPERS ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT MEANINGFUL ACTION
HAPPENS AND THE ACTION WE TAKE WORKS.
AND I KNOW THIS POLICY ORDER DEALS WITH IT. THERE'S AN URGENCY, I
SUPPORT AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL WHO WORKED ON AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO DOING WHATEVER CAN I TO REMIND US OF THE URGENCY AND
GET TO WORK TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. COVID IS AN EMERGENCY, THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY. LET'S TREAT THEM THE SAME WAY. IN TERMS OF
FOCUSSING ATTENTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: I WAS TRYING TO READ THE ORDER THAT MY
COLLEAGUE WANTED TO PULL. LET MY JUST SAY THIS, MAYOR SIDDIQUI, ONE
THING WE HAVE TO BE BETTER AT IS TALKING FOR PEOPLE AND NOT TO
PEOPLE. I LIVED IN THE PORT FOR 40 YEARS, WE ALL -- MANY OF US DON'T
SHARE THIS. WE DON'T WANT POLICE PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I
SAT IN A MEETING NOT TOO LONG AGO, A MOTHER CRIED AND SAID, MY KIDS
WILL NOT COME OUTSIDE -- WHEN THEY FEEL SAFE AND THEY DON'T FEAR
THE POLICE. SO, LET US NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES TRYING TO SPEAK
FOR COMMUNITY THAT A FEW MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
GO AND VISIT WHEN IT -- PARTICULARLY WHEN IT WENT ELECTION TIME.
I CAN'T SUPPORT THAT ORDER. I DO SPEAK TO MY NEIGHBORHOODS, THE
ONES THAT LIVE NEXT DOOR TO ME IN THE BUILDING AND AT THE BODEGA
AND AT THE PARK AND AT THE SCHOOL. AND OUR SENIORS, IN PARTICULAR,


PAGE 52

Aug 2 2021

WHO WANT TO SEE THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL IN THE
COMMUNITY. THEY LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO
HAVE. WE CAN'T TALK FOR ALL PEOPLE BY SAYING I WANT TO CHANGE THIS
ABOUT DEPLOYING LAW ENFORCEMENT. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT
MORE OF MY NEIGHBORS THAN NOT WANT TO SEE LAW ENFORCEMENT.
SOME OF YOU THAT MAY NOT LIVE AS CLOSE TO THE PORT, I LIVE IN THE
PORT FROM JUST PRIOR TO FOURTH OF JULY TO JUST RECENTLY, THERE ARE
FIRECRACKERS GOING OFF. ALL HOURS OF THE DAY. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE
POLICE OFFICER WAS SITTING AT THE SITE WHERE THE PROBLEM OCCURS
THAT IT STOPPED. I HAD MY NEIGHBOR, WHERE THE BULLETS WENT
THROUGH HER -- APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR. SAYING CAN YOU GET
A POLICE OFFICER TO BE IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE. I CAN MAKE SURE MY KIDS
-- I'M JUST SAYING TO MY COLLEAGUES, WALK WITH ME ON THIS ONE.
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY MORE OF MY NEIGHBORS THAN NOT WANT TO SEE
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, WHAT IS VERY GOOD ABOUT OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, A GOOD MANY OF THEM, OFFICER SANTIAGO,
NOT THAT FAR AWAY. I WILL DRAW THE BLANK ON THE NAME. THEY LIVE BY
THE FLETCHER ACADEMY. ALL GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT IS NOT
LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY DON'T KNOW. ALL FROM THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD, KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN THEY WALK
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ARE NOT SEEN JUST AS LAW
ENFORCEMENT, BUT FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK
YOU LEAVE THIS ORDER AS IS. IT SENDS A MESSAGE, THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER, WE SEE, HEAR, AND FEEL THEIR CONCERN. I
WANT TO SAY THAT.
LASTLY, AS WE TALK ABOUT PROGRAMS AND IN THE ORDER, WE OFTEN SAY
YOUTH. I WOULD LIKE US TO BROADEN THAT DEFINITION AND SAY YOUTH
AND YOUNG ADULTS. SOME PEOPLE -- SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT WE TALK
ABOUT ARE NOT YOUTH. WE ARE GREAT, WE HAVE PROGRAMS, BUT THEY
ONLY HOLD THE YOUNG PEOPLE UNTIL THEY ARE 18 AND THEN THEY FALL
OFF. THERE ARE NO SERVICES THERE FOR THEM. CAN I GO TO TALK ABOUT
HOW TO IMPROVE THE NINE-WEEK PROGRAM. WE TALK TO THE CITY
MANAGER AND THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ABOUT THAT. I DON'T WANT TO
PROLONG THIS. SPECIFIC TO MY COLLEAGUE'S SUGGESTION, I WILL NOT
VOTE FOR THAT. I TALKED TO MY NEIGHBORS. I LIVE HERE AND TALK TO
NEIGHBORS. I'M HERE TO ASSURE YOU MORE WANT TO SEE THAT PRESENCE
THAN DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT PRESENCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO
NOT VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT. I YIELD THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE A FEW HANDS UP. COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN,
VICE-MAYOR MALLON. AND THEN BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. I
HAVEN'T SPOKEN, I WILL BE BRIEF. I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE THIS AS IS. IF WE
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED, WE STILL HAVE -- THE CITY MANAGER BE
AND HEREBY REQUESTED TO COORDINATE WITH THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE
COMMISSIONER TO ASSESS WHAT IS DRIVING THE NEW ACTIVITY. AND
DEPLOY THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO TAMP DOWN ON THE GUN VIOLENCE
IN THE AREAS. THESE ARE REALLY SERIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. THE
CAMBRIDGE POLICE HAS TO BE INVOLVED. AND THEY SHOULD BE INVOLVED.


PAGE 53

Aug 2 2021

IF WE GO BACK TO XAVIER'S MURDER. IT IS STILL UNSOLVED. WE NEED TO BE
PARTNERING WITH THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON WHAT THE
POLICY ORDER CALLS FOR. ASSESSING WHAT DRIVES THE NEW ACTIVITY. THE
OTHER ORDERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO -- AS PEOPLE SAID -- SHORT-TERM AND
LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ADDRESS WHAT IS
HAPPENING.
I DON'T THINK REMOVING CAMBRIDGE POLICE COMMISSIONER WILL REALLY
HELP ANYONE IN THIS RESPECT. APPARENTLY, WE ALL HAVE TO COME
TOGETHER ON THE SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT I WILL SAY. WE'LL GO TO
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. I ALSO WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING
THIS AMENDMENT. I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. I
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO IS TALKING ABOUT POLICING.
KEPT SAYING TO ME, NATIONAL STUDIES SHOW... THIS STUDY SHOWS... THIS
STUDY SHOWS. WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE IMPACTED BY THE VIOLENCE, THEY
DO NOT CARE ABOUT WHAT THE NATIONAL STUDY SHOWS. THEY KNOW
THEY CAN'T LET THEIR KID OUTSIDE TO PLAY ON THE SWINGS ON A
BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
SO, THEY WANT AS COUNCILLOR SIMMONS SAID, YOU TALK TO FOLKS,
PARTICULARLY LIVING IN THE PUBLIC HOUSING, NOT ONE OF THEM SAID I
WANT FEWER POLICE. NOT ONE. THAT INCLUDES YOUNG PEOPLE, BY THE
WAY. AND SO, RIGHT NOW, WHETHER SOME OF US FEEL SAFER HAVING
POLICE AROUND OR NOT. BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT SAYING THERE AREN'T ISSUES
WITH POLICING. WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT AND
TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM INVOLVING THE POLICE ON CERTAIN TYPES OF
CALLS AND ACTIVITIES. AND LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES TO POLICING. WE ARE
DOING THAT WORK.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEEL SAFER -- SOME FOLKS, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE
UNDERCOVER COPS. THEY WANT A UNIT TO SEE. KIDS WILL DO STUFF
WHETHER THE POLICE ARE THERE OR NOT. REMOVING POLICE FROM THIS
CONVERSATION AND MAKING IT AS IF POLICE ARE NOT AN IMPORTANT PART
OF HELPING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS A MISTAKE. THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE
ARE NOT PERFECT, I'M SORRY, WE ARE NOT ST. LOUIS. WE ARE NOT
MINNEAPOLIS. IT DOESN'T MEAN BAD THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN HER, WE HAVE
TO BE VIGILANT AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR. THEY HAVE TO HAVE A SEAT AT
THE TABLE. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE ASKING FOR.
AND REMOVE THEM FROM THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING
TO PROMOTE A NATIONAL AGENDA IS NOT THE THING WE SHOULD BE
DOING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE
AMENDMENT. THESE ARE ACTIVE INVESTIGATIONS IMPACTING PEOPLE
RIGHT NOW. I'M VERY SURPRISED TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUE WANTING TO
STRIKE THIS LANGUAGE. I REMEMBER IN 2018, LISTENING TO THAT SAME
COLLEAGUE SPEAK PASSIONATELY ABOUT HOW HE TRUSTED THE POLICE


PAGE 54

Aug 2 2021

DEPARTMENT TO COME TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE GUN VIOLENCE
HAPPENING IN 2018, IN ANOTHER JULY. I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THE SAME
COLLEAGUE WANTING TO STRIKE THE LANGUAGE OUT OF THIS PARTICULAR
POLICY ORDER. I WON'T SUPPORT IT TONIGHT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO CALL
THE QUESTION ON THE AMENDMENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DID SAY I WOULD RECOGNIZE COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN. AND THEN WE'LL CALL THE QUESTION.
>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: POINT OF ORDER. I WANT TO DEFER TO THE
CLERK. THE QUESTION HAS BEEN CALLED. CAN YOU CONTINUE THE
CONVERSATION. I'M CURIOUS. IF THAT IS THE CASE, I WILL STAND
CORRECTED. IF IT IS NOT, I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE VOTE.
>> MR. CLERK: PURSUANT TO THE RULES, WHEN THE QUESTION IS CALLED,
DEBATE ENDS AND GO TO THE VOTE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I WAS RECOGNIZING THAT I SAID WE'LL GO TO
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN. I HAVE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. CLERK WILSON,
IF THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE RULES, WE CAN GO AND CALL THE QUESTION.
>> MR. CLERK: THE FIRST VOTE IS ON CALLING THE QUESTION. IF THE VOTE
PASSES, WE'LL GO TO THE VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT. IF THE VOTE TO CALL
THE QUESTION FAILS, DEBATE WILL CONTINUE. ON THE MOTION TO CALL
THE QUESTION:

Motion to call the question on
Councillor Zondervan’s
Amendment

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: YES.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: NO.

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION PASSES. FIVE IN FAVOR, ONE ABSENT, AND THREE
AGAINST. MOTION TO STRIKE THE FIRST PARAGRAPH FROM POLICY ORDER
FOUR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: NO.

Councillor Zondervan’s
Motion to strike the first
ordered paragraph in Policy
Order #4

>> MR. CLERK: I'M SORRY. STRIKE THE FIRST ORDERED PARAGRAPH FROM
POLICY ORDER FOUR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: NO.
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: NO.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: ABSENT.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: NO.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO.
>> MR. CLERK: MOTION FAILS, ONE IN FAVOR, ONE ABSENT, AND SEVEN
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS BEFORE WE GO TO ADOPT?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SPEAK. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE POLICE ROLE
IN SOLVING CRIMES AND INVESTIGATING THEM. WE DON'T NEED A POLICY
ORDER FOR THEM TO DO THAT JOB. THAT IS THEIR JOB AND THEY WILL
PERFORM IT TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. I LIVE IN
WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON, WHICH IS ONE NAMED IN THE POLICY ORDER. I
DON'T APPRECIATE THE IMPLICATIONS THAT I DON'T SPEAK TO PEOPLE BEING
AFFECTED BY THIS OR THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. I LIVE
IT TOO. IT IS A SMALL CITY AND AS I SAID BEFORE, IT AFFECTED MY OWN
FAMILY.
I SPEAK WITH AND LISTEN TO MANY YOUNG BLACK MEN AND WOMEN, IT IS
NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS, IT IS ABOUT THE SYSTEM OF POLICING,
WHICH IS ROOTED IN WHITE SUPREMACY AND VIOLENCE. WHEN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS ISSUE, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOT -- I'M NOT DENYING
THAT SOME PEOPLE CALL FOR GREATER POLICE PRESENCE. I UNDERSTAND
THAT. THEY DOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE CORRECT RESPONSE. AND AFTER
DECADES OF FAILED POLICY BASED ON INCREASED POLICE, AT SOME POINT,
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT IS NOT WORKING. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT
RESPONSE AND INVESTING MORE IN THAT IS DOING HARM. AS HAS BEEN
SAID BEFORE, WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES -- WE ARE FUNDING
THE HEART PROGRAM. WE ARE LOOKING AT A NON-ARMED RESPONSE. IF
WE BELIEVE THAT IS THE WAY TO GO, WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVEST IN
THAT. THAT'S WHY I OFFERED THE AMENDMENT. I DO APPRECIATE THE
POLICY ORDER AND I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION IT IS IN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. MOTION TO ADOPT
BY COUNCILLOR SIMMONS. WE ARE GOING TO DO A ROLL CALL.

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: YES.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> MR. CLERK: NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOVING TO POLICY ORDER 5. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 5).
>> VICE-MAYOR MALLON: THANK YOU. I WILL BE VERY BRIEF. OUR
RESTAURANTS HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THERE
WAS A SPECIFIC FUND SET UP THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE
RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND, WHICH HAD ALMOST $30 BILLION IN IT.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT RAN OUT BEFORE 70% OF THE RESTAURANTS COULD
ACCESS ANY OF THE FUNDS.
THIS IS DEVASTATING AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A BILL -- SIGNED
A BILL TO REPLENISH THAT FUND TO THE TUNE OF $60 BILLION. MANY FEAR
IT WILL BE TOO LATE BY THE TIME IT IS ON THE FLOOR, VOTED ON, GOES
THROUGH RECONCILIATION AND WE'LL LOSE MANY OF THE RESTAURANTS.
THIS IS JUST US GOING ON RECORD URGING OUR FEDERAL DELEGATION TO
DO WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO REPLENISH THE FUNDS, PUSH IT THROUGH,
MAKE SURE OUR RESTAURANTS HAVE THE FUNDS THEY NEED TO SURVIVE.
I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF YOU READ THE "BOSTON GLOBE" ARTICLE TODAY
FROM OUR COMMONWEALTH KITCHEN, COMMONWEALTH RESTAURANT
RATHER, DOWN IN KENDALL SQUARE, THE SITUATION IS DIRE FOR SO MANY
RESTAURANTS. AND THE RESTAURANT revitalization FUND NEEDS TO BE
REPLENISHED TO ENSURE THE RESTAURANTS ARE VIBRANT. THIS IS GOING
ON RECORD, URGING DELEGATION TO SUPPORT THIS. I SPENT THURSDAY
AND FRIDAY SPEAKING WITH THE FEDERAL DELEGATIONS AND JUST REALLY
STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE
REPLENISHED AND WE CAN SUPPORT OUR RESTAURANTS.
I WILL ALSO SAY... PLEASE SUPPORT THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS. THEY REALLY
NEED THE HELP. I HOPE THE COLLEAGUES CAN JOIN US TONIGHT, MYSELF,
COUNCILLOR NOLAN, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, AND YOURSELF, MAYOR
SIDDIQUI, THE FOUR OF US. I HOPE THE COLLEAGUES CAN SUPPORT US AS
WE MOVE IT FORWARD. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. THIS POLICY ORDER IS
THE PROVERBIAL NO-BRAINER. WE DO NEED TO DO MORE AND THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE -- AS THE
VICE-MAYOR MALLON SAID, 30% OF RESTAURANTS THAT APPLY IS
UNACCEPTABLE. THEY ARE NOT CLOSE TO BEING OUT OF THE WOODS. THE


PAGE 57

Aug 2 2021

PANDEMIC IS RECEDING, IT IS STILL WITH US. WE HAVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL
SUPPORTS. THANK YOU TO VICE-MAYOR MALLON, TO THE MAYOR, AND
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, FOR SPONSORING THIS. AND I BELIEVE -- THERE IS
ONE SMALL TYPO IN THE LAST ONE. IT SAYS REPRESENTATIVE CLERK, INSTEAD
OF CLARK, WE MAY WANT TO FIX THAT WHEN WE VOTE THE POLICY ORDER
IN. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK VICE-MAYOR
MALLON, YOURSELF, AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN FOR COSPONSORING THIS AS
BEEN STATED. SMALL RESTAURANTS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN UNDER A LOT OF
PRESSURE AND BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE PAST YEAR AND HALF FOR
THEM. AND HOPEFULLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REPLENISH THE
FUNDS. I WANT TO SAY THAT YESTERDAY, THE EAST CAMBRIDGE BUSINESS
ASSOCIATION, COSPONSORED THE ARTS AND CRAFTS. IT WAS INCREDIBLE
EVENT WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT CAME THROUGH THE SQUARE.
MOSTLY TO BENEFIT THE RESTAURANTS THAT WERE THERE. AND I KNOW THE
RESTAURANT OWNERS AND THE STAFF WERE ECSTATIC WITH THE CROWDS
THERE AND THE EXPOSURE THEY WERE GETTING AT THE GREAT EVENT.
THERE WERE CRAFTS SOLD AND A GREAT EVENT. AND I KNOW MOST
COLLEAGUES WERE THERE YESTERDAY. THEY WERE WORKING, VISITING AND
EATING AND PATRONIZING THE BUSINESS. IT WAS A GREAT DAY. THE
RESTAURANT -- THEY ARE ECSTATIC THAT THE CROWDS WERE THERE. AND
THE EXPOSURE THEY GOT YESTERDAY FROM THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM
AROUND, NOT ONLY CAMBRIDGE, THE METROPOLITAN AREA. IT WAS A
GREAT DAY. I THANK ALL THE ORGANIZERS. WE'LL PUT IN A RESOLUTION FOR
THE SEPTEMBER MEETING BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT.
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED. SO, THE VOLUNTEERS AND PUBLIC
WORKS, PUBLIC SAFETY. EVERYBODY WAS INVOLVED. I WILL LEAVE IT AT
THAT. A GREAT EVENT AND SHOWED HOW MUCH WAIT STAFF AND
RESTAURANTS REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE CITY. AND
THE RESIDENTS WERE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I'M HAPPY TO BE COSPONSOR OF THIS.
AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP OUR BUSINESSES RIGHT
NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO AMEND THE TYPO. TO CLARK. SORRY, I MISSED
THAT. I USUALLY CATCH THEM. DO WE NEED A ROLL CALL FOR A TYPO?
>> MR. CLERK: YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> MR. CLERK: AMENDING THE PARAGRAPH TO REPLACE THE WORD CLERK
WITH CLARK. (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST. ON THE ORDER
AS AMENDED: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: POLICY ORDER NUMBER 6: ) READING POLICY ORDER

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. I WON'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME
BECAUSE THIS WILL GO TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE. YOU MIGHT
RECALL OR THE COUNCIL MAY RECALL WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH A BUILDING
AND THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD, WELLINGTON/HARRINGTON, WHICH IS
REFERRED TO A LYNDON PARK. AND A LOT OF PRINCIPLES CAME OUT OF
THAT. MAKING A BUILDING FIT IN BETTER. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF LAB, IN PARTICULAR, DEVELOPMENT GOING ON. AND LABS
HAVE MANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS, ESPECIALLY NEXT TO LOW-DENSITY
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND ALL THIS DOES IS PROPOSE THAT WE NOT ALLOW -LABS CAN BE IN 2/3 OF ALL OUR ZONING DISTRICTS. EVERY COMMERCIAL
DISTRICT, NO MATTER HOW SMALL IN DENSITY IT IS. THIS BASICALLY TRIES TO
SAY THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST A 250-FOOT BUFFER TO A
LOW-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD EDGE.
IN THAT BUFFER, IT COULD BE HOUSING, IT COULD BE OFFICE. IT IS NOT
OPEN SPACE. THIS INCLUDES MASS AVENUE, BETWEEN HARVARD AND
ARLINGTON. OR BETWEEN CENTRAL AND HARVARD SQUARE. IT WOULD
INCLUDE OTHER MAIN AVENUES WHERE SMALL COMMERCIAL IS ALLOWED.
NOW WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT ELIMINATING LABS AS A POTENTIAL IN
CENTRAL SQUARE, HARVARD SQUARE, ALL THE SQUARES BUT KENDALL,
WHAT I DID IN THIS WRITING IS HAVE VERY HIGH STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL
PERMIT THAT ARE BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE ALEXANDRIA
LYNDON PARK STUDY RESOLUTION. I WANTED TO EXPLAIN IT. IF WE DON'T
LIMIT LABS IN LOW-DENSITY DISTRICTS, THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS. THEY
WILL BE UP AND DOWN AND THEY ARE NOT GOOD NEIGHBORS. LABS ARE
THE INDUSTRY OF TODAY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS ON THIS. MOVE TO
ADOPT. AND ROLL CALL?
>> MR. CLERK: FOR ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER 8. (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 8).

Policy Order #7
That the City Manager instruct
the Community Development
Department to draft zoning
amendments requiring special
permits be required for research
and development, laboratory and
research facilities in the districts
noted in the attached
memorandum to ensure a robust
community process.

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO MOVE -- ASK THAT
WE MOVE THIS POLICY ORDER TO THE TABLE. WE HEARD EARLIER -SOMEONE WORKING ON THIS. SHE REACHED OUT TO COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN AND I BELIEVE TO COUNCILLOR NOLAN. WE HAVE BEEN
WORKING COLLEGIALLY TO BRING AROUND SOME DISCUSSION AROUND
REPARATIONS IN RELATIONSHIP TO SLAVERY. THE IMPACT ON BLACK AND
BROWN RESIDENTS. WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT AND IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO MS. VAN JAMES. SHE IS THOUGHTFUL AND I SAID I
WOULD SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE HER LEAD A MORE AUTHENTIC
ROUND-UP CONVERSATION AROUND THIS AND BRING BACK
RECOMMENDATIONS. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE PUT THIS ON THE FLOOR FOR
OUR CONSIDERATION AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUE, COUNCILLOR NOLAN, HAS
JOINED MY COLLEAGUE. HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT MS.
VAN JAMES, HERE THOUGHTFULNESS AND HER INTEREST IN MAKING SURE AS
MANY VOICES CAN BE HEARD AROUND THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE, WE


PAGE 59

Aug 2 2021

CERTAINLY WANT TO DO IT. I'M SURE WE WANT TO DO IT WELL AND DO IT
WHERE WE REACHED OUT TO AND ENGAGED AS MANY VOICES AND WE
EARLIER MOVED A SIMILAR ORDER IN THE SAME VEIN, RELATIVELY CLOSE
TOPIC TO ALLOW FOR THAT PROCESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES
TO MOVE THIS TO THE TABLE TO ALLOW MS. VAN JAMES, AND OTHERS,
INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NAMED ON THE PROPOSED ORDER,
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH IT OUT MORE AND TO ENGAGE THE
COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MOTION TO MOVE TO THE TABLE. COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN, YOUR HAND IS UP AND THEN COUNCILLOR NOLAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. MY THANKS TO COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS
MENTIONED WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE BASED ON
THE ORIGINAL POLICY ORDER THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY COUNCILLOR
SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN. THROUGH THAT DISCUSSION, WE
DECIDED TOGETHER THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO BRING FORWARD
THIS SEPARATE POLICY ORDER TO ADDRESS THE HARM DONE BY THE WAR ON
DRUGS AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION. I FULLY
SUPPORT PUTTING IT ON THE TABLE FOR NOW SO WE CAN HEAR FROM
MORE OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR NOLAN?
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I WILL BE BRIEF. I AGREE WITH AND
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR
ZONDERVAN SAID, HAPPY TO LAY IT ON THE TABLE. WE DO FEEL -- WE WANT
TO MOVE FORWARD AND RECOGNIZE WE WANT MORE OF THE COMMUNITY
INVOLVED. THE POLICY ORDERS ARE INTENDED TO HELP THE COMMUNITY
MOVE FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS ADVANCING
RELATIVELY QUICKLY TO GET TO THE WORK OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE'LL DO
RESTITUTION AND REPARATIONS FROM A COUPLE OF PERSPECTIVES.
GRATEFUL FOR COLLEAGUES WORKING TOGETHER AND FOR THE
COMMUNITY SUGGESTING THEY WANT TO BE MORE INVOLVED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SO, ON THE MOTION TO MOVE THIS ON THE TABLE,
WE'LL DO A ROLL CALL.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE MOTION: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE MOVE TO POLICY ORDER NUMBER 9. (READING
POLICY ORDER NUMBER 9). I WILL THANK THE COSPONSORS AND AS THE
POLICY ORDER LAYS OUT, MANY RESIDENTS HAVE WORKED WITH IQHQ, THEY
MADE EFFORTS TO COLLABORATE WITH RESIDENTS ON BRINGING THIS VISION
FOR JERRY'S POND TO LIFE. THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY IMPORTANT
REPORTS, THE CRA HAS A OPEN-SPACE VISION THAT HAS A LOT OF GREAT
SUBSTANCE TO IT. AND SO THIS POLICY ORDER IS REALLY ASKING TO SEE
HOW THE CITY CAN GET INVOLVED IN THE IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY
HAVE REALLY NOT BEEN IN THE DISCUSSION -- AS IT RELATES TO WHAT IQHQ
IS DOING. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS AREA

PAGE 60

Policy Order #8
That the City Manager be and
hereby is requested to direct the
appropriate City staff to establish
a restitution program that would
take a to-be-determined
percentage of revenue from local
cannabis sales and distribute
these monies to current and
former Cambridge residents who
have been harmed by the war on
drugs, with a targeted launch date
of July 2022.

Aug 2 2021

AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THIS AREA. THAT'S ALL I'LL SAY. COUNCILLOR
CARLONE? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE: THANK YOU. THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES ABOUT
THE BENEFIT OF OPEN SPACE. I THINK I MENTIONED LAST TIME WE MET, WE
ARE VERY DEFICIENT IN OPEN SPACE AS A CITY, EVEN WITH FRESH POND
NEARBY. THERE'S LIMITED TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT USE IT EVERY
DAY. I'M NOT SURE IF PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THAT. IT IS A WATER
DEPARTMENT RESERVE.
WE HAVE HALF OF THE OPEN SPACE THAT THE AVERAGE CITY HAS. WE HAVE
CERTAIN PARTS OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TOO
MUCH OPEN SPACE AT ALL. SO THIS IS CRITICAL, EVEN THOUGH IT IS UNIQUE
-- POTENTIALLY UNIQUE OPEN SPACE, IT IS THE KIND THAT CAN BE ENJOYED
IN A REFLECTIVE WAY OR A PASSIVE WAY. I WAS RECENTLY VISITING MY SON
IN SEATTLE, WE WENT TO A WETLAND WITH RESTFUL STOPS ON A RAISED
PATH. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. I THINK IN A WAY THIS COULD BE A
SIMILAR SPACE. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME AND I'M DELIGHTED TO
COSPONSOR ANY PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT IN OPEN SPACE. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS
POSSIBILITY. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE POSSIBLE GEM IN THE CITY. AND THE
WORK THAT IS DONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ALEWIFE, WITH THE
RESTORATION OF THE WETLAND, SHOWS HOW AMAZING WETLAND CAN BE
WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. IT WAS DONE WITH A LARGE COLLABORATION. THIS
IS DONE WITH A COMBINATION OF IQHQ, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM -- AS
THEY BUILD THEIR SPACE, THEIR LAB SPACE, THEY ARE WILLING TO DO A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT TO PROPERTY. I KNOW
THAT THE MAYOR IS GROWING UP ACROSS THE STREET HAS PUSHED US TO
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.
THE MEETINGS HELD BY THE COMMITTEE, THE NLTP, NEIGHBORHOOD OF
LONG-TERM PLANNING, BROUGHT TOGETHER GROUPS WITH THE VISION AND
HAS BEEN BUILT UPON WITH IQHQ MOVING FORWARD. LOTS OF
COMMUNITY MEETINGS. I WILL GIVE A SHUTOUT TO THE ALEWIFE STUDY
GROUP, FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND, ALEWIFE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION,
YOUR OFFICE, YOU WORKED SO HARD ON THIS FOR MANY MONTHS OR
MAYBE UP TO YEARS NOW. WE ARE NOW FINALLY AT THE PLACE WHERE THE
PLANS ARE COMING TO FRUITION AND COMING TO A TIME WHEN THEY ARE
BEING FINALIZED. IT IS A REALLY EXCITING VISION FOR THAT AREA AND THE
LAST BIT IS, THE QUESTION ALONG THE SIDEWALK AND WHETHER THE CITY
CAN PARTICIPATE IN ENSURING THE VISION THAT WE CAN CONTROL, WHICH
IS ON THE PUBLIC WAY, CAN YIELD A BETTER SPACE FOR THE PUBLIC TO USE. I
KNOW MY KIDS WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL USES
RUSSELL FIELD, THE PLAYGROUND IS USED, THERE'S A POOL. SO MANY
AMENITIES AND THIS IS WAY TO PROVIDE ANOTHER NATURE RESERVE IN
CONJUNCTION WITH A LOT -- SEVERAL NONPROFITS THAT STEPPED UP TO TRY
TO HELP US. I'M EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD. I APPRECIATE YOUR
LEADERSHIP AND ALSO THE OTHER -- THE ENTIRE COUNCIL AS WE MOVE
FORWARD ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY THE CITY WILL TAKE THIS ON. THANK


PAGE 61

Aug 2 2021

YOU. I YIELD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.
>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS ON THE
AGENDA AND I HOPE WE MOVE IT FORWARD. I FIRST GOT INVOLVED WITH
FRIENDS OF JERRY'S POND, THE LAND POLICY ISSUE, I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED
THEIR YEARLY CLEAN-UP. INCLUDING THE ONE THIS YEAR AND -- GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR OPEN SPACE AND FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
OPPORTUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I WANT TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. I KNOW WE DID A LOT OF
WORK ON THIS LAST TERM. AND REALLY EXCITING TO SEE THIS PROGRESSING
AND MOVING FORWARD AND MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I'M REALLY
EXCITED AND HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET TO THE RIGHT OUTCOME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU EVERYBODY. NO OTHER HANDS UP, ROLL
CALL ON ADOPTION.
>> MR. CLERK: ON ADOPTION: (ROLL CALL): NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO POLICY ORDER 10: (READING POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 10).
>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN: THANK YOU. NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING A
RESURGENCE DUE TO THE DELTA VARIANT OF COVID-19, EMPLOYERS IN THE
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SPHERES IS STARTING TO MANDATE VACCINES. AS WE
GET INTO THE NEXT STAGE OF COVID-19, IT IS CRITICAL IMPORTANT THAT WE
AS THE CITY DO ALL WE CAN. WE CAN ENCOURAGE THEM AND WORK WITH
EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE THE EMPLOYEES ARE VACCINATED. IF THEY
DON'T LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE, THEY WORK IN CAMBRIDGE. PUBLIC HEALTH
DEPARTMENT IN CAMBRIDGE AS WARNED RESIDENTS OF AN UPTICK. NEW
YORK CITY AND CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCED PLAN TO MANDATE VACCINE OR
WEEKLY TESTING. THIS POLICY ORDER ASKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER TO LET
US KNOW HOW IT IS WE'LL GET TO 100% VACCINATION RATES. I WILL NOTE,
THERE IS AN AMENDMENT BY COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, SPECIFICALLY
CALLING OUT THE ADDITION OF SCHOOL STAFF. THOSE OF US ON THE POLICY
ORDER, ASSUME THAT SCHOOL STAFF ARE INCLUDED. THEY ARE CITY STAFF.
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOL, DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY, THIS INCLUDES IT BY
DEFINITION. IF WE THINK IT WOULD BE MORE IMPACTFUL IF WE ADD THAT
SPECIFICALLY, HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT.

Policy Order #9
That the City Manager confer
with the Department of Public
Works, the Cambridge
Redevelopment Authority, the
Community Development
Department, and other relevant
City staff to discuss the
feasibility of committing
financial resources to assist in
redesigning and/or reshaping the
outdoor public ways, natural
space and infrastructure including
sidewalks, protected bike lanes
and tree canopy at the southern
edge of Jerry’s Pond along
Rindge Avenue to make it more
accessible, more green and more
equitable and to create a
welcoming entryway to
Cambridge from the west

AND SIMILARLY, THE WORDING OF GETTING TO 100% VACCINATION RATE, IN
THE POLICY ORDER, IMPLICITLY INCLUDES CONSIDERING OF A MANDATE. I'M
HAPPY TO HAVE THAT BE CONSIDERED. IF THE COUNCIL -- AS COUNCILLOR
MCGOVERN SUGGESTED, WE ADD IT AND MAKE IT EXPLICIT. IT WAS
INCLUDED IN THE WAY IT WAS FORMULATED AND INTENDED TO ASK THE CITY
MANAGER TO GET -- THE IDEA IS, WE NEED TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE
SHOW LEADERSHIP, WE ARE A ROLE MODEL AND WALKING THE TALK OF
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR ENTIRE CITY CAN BE SAFE.

VACCINATIONS WORK, THEY ARE THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH.
CDC NOTED THE CLUSTER IN PROVINCETOWN, THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT
INCIDENT SHOWS VACCINATIONS ARE WORKING. WE HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN. GET BEYOND THIS AND I'M HAPPY TO YIELD FOR NOW.
I HOPE THIS IS SUPPORTED UNANIMOUSLY. AND THE CITY MANAGER, WE ASK
FOR REPORT BY SEPTEMBER 13TH, WOULD LOVE TO GET A REPORT BEFORE
THEN ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON. THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO COUNCILLOR
NOLAN AND ALL THE SPONSORS. I DID TALK WITH COUNCILLOR NOLAN
EARLIER TODAY. SHE DID INFORM ME THAT -- I THINK SHE IS ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CITY STAFF, THAT DOES INCLUDE THE
SCHOOLS. I HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW SOMETIMES IF
WE ARE NOT EXPLICIT, PEOPLE INTERPRET THINGS DIFFERENTLY. I OFFERED
THAT AMENDMENT, WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS SENT TO ANYBODY. I
DON'T KNOW IF THE CLERK WANTS TO SHARE IT. IT MAKES IT EXPLICIT, IT
INCLUDE SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND TO INCLUDE MANDATORY VACCINATION
IN THE -- POTENTIAL IN THE REPORT. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND I HATE TO
GET SOMETHING BACK THAT WE HEAR -- WE ARE NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED. WE INTERPRETED IT DIFFERENTLY. I WANT TO PUT THIS
FORWARD TO BE MORE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I SEE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN'S HAND UP. I WILL SAY,
I MENTIONED THIS TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, THE SCHOOLS -- THERE'S
DISCUSSION. AND USUALLY THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL POLICY AND CITY
POLICY IS DIFFERENT. IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, SO JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT. WE HAVE OUR COMMITTEE MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT. I'LL
SUPPORT THIS AND TO SAY THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN
HAPPENING. I'LL GO TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.
>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: I WAS CONSIDERING SOMETHING SIMILAR
MYSELF IN TERMS OF MANDATING VACCINATIONS. I DON'T THINK WE NEED
TO CHANGE IT. I SUPPORT IT AS IS. I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MANDATING VACCINATION FOR ITS EMPLOYEES.
OF COURSE, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR THOSE WHO ULTIMATELY NOT TO
GET A VACCINE. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF SOCIAL
DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS. JUST SO PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND, A VACCINATE MANDATE DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE WILL LOSE
THEIR JOB IF THEY ARE NOT VACCINATED. THE IMPLEMENTATION SHOULD
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO GET VACCINATED ARE STILL
BEING SAFE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP. WE CAN DO A ROLL
CALL ON THE AMENDMENT.
>> MR. CLERK: ON THE AMENDMENT: (ROLL CALL). NINE IN FAVOR, ZERO
AGAINST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NO OTHER HANDS, ROLL CALL ON THE POLICY ORDER AS
AMENDED.
