ELDER SERVICES AND JUDITH. WE ARE HERE FOR NATIONAL OLDER ADULTS
MONTH. A TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT OLDER ADULTS
MAKE IN COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS YEAR'S NATIONAL OLDER
ADULTS MONTH THEME IS COMMUNITIES OF STRENGTH. AND OVER THE
PAST YEAR, THE CAMBRIDGE COUNCIL ON AGING HAS WITNESSED THE
STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF OLDER ADULTS. WHEN THE COVID 19
PANDEMIC DISRUPTED IN PERSON PROGRAMMING AT COA, STAFF AND
INSTRUCTORS ADAPTED TO TECHNOLOGY TO OFFER A VARIETY OF VIRTUAL
PROGRAMMING. OUR VIRTUAL PROGRAMMING ALLOWED THE CAMBRIDGE
SENIOR COMMUNITY TO BE CONNECTED AND ENGAGED. IT SERVED AS A
SUPPORT AND INSPIRED MANY TO THRIVE IN SOCIAL CONNECTION DURING A
PERIOD WHERE MANY FELT ISOLATED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO JUDITH?
>> IF YOU CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI, JUDITH. I'M WITH THE SOMERVILLE CAMBRIDGE ELDER SERVICES. I
VOLUNTEERED THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I NOW SERVE ON THE
BOARD AS WELL. I WANT TO LET I APPRECIATE THE CITY COUNCIL
PRIORITIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING OUR OLDER POPULATION. IT IS
SOMETHING NOT JUST FOR THIS MONTH, BUT OBVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE
YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC. SOMERVILLE CAMBRIDGE ELDER SERVICE HAS
DONE ITS BEST TO REALLY UP THE THINGS THAT IT OFFERS TO ELDERS,
INCLUDING UPPING THE NUMBER OF MEALS WE DELIVER THROUGH MEALS
ON WHEELS. AND OFFERING FREE RIDES TO GET VACCINATIONS WHEN
NEEDED. AND WE INVITE ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE LOOKING TO HELP AN
ELDER, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO, ALONG WITH CAREGIVERS AND
DISABLED PEOPLE. CALL US AT OUR OFFICE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. GO TO ORI PORAT.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? MYRTLE AVENUE AND WILL SPEAK AGAINST
RESOLUTION 109. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND
HAVE GREW UP IN ISRAEL. TO BE CLEAR ON MANY THINGS, I'M CRITICAL OF
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, THE BROADER THEME OF THIS
CONFLICT IS NOT COLONIALISM, NOT APARTHEID, IT IS A TERRITORIAL
DISPUTE. CASE IN POINT, 1979, ISRAEL RETURN THE PENINSULA TEN TIMES
LARGER THAN GAZA TO EGYPT FOR STABLE AND LASTING PEACE, WHICH IS IN
PLACE TO THIS DAY. 1990 PROCESS WAS ANSWERED WITH SUICIDE
BOMBERS, AND IN 2005, THE COMPLETE AND WITHDRAWAL WAS ANSWERED
WITH ROCKETS. I URGE YOU TO DENY THE RHETORIC AND ADOPT THE
RESOLUTION FOR PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL SIDES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO AMANDA JACIR.
>> HI, AMANDA. PALESTINIAN RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. URGING YOU TO
SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 109 AND 114. LAST WEEK, I RECOUNTED TO YOU
HOW MY FRIEND WOKE UP THAT 20 MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WERE KILLED
OVERNIGHT. TODAY THE HORROR CONTINUES. ISRAEL ANNOUNCED THE LAN
TO ABDUCT AND INCARCERATE PALESTINIANS AS PUNISHMENT FOR
ADVOCATING FOR THEIR RIGHTS WHILE THEY TAKE OVER THE STREETS. WHY

PAGE 3

May 24, 2021

SHOULD IT MATTER? HP WILL EQUAL APARTHEID BY PROVIDING TECH. IN
CAMBRIDGE WILL ENABLE THE VIOLENCE BY CONTRACTING HP. WHETHER
WE LIKE IT OR NOT, THE COMMUNITY IS COMPLICIT AND YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM
THE HARM WE ARE COMPLICIT IT. THE SAME VALUE APPLIES TO LISTENING
TO THE COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE THE POWER AND THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ALAN MEYERS.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> ALAN. A PROFESSOR AT PEDIATRIC AT THE BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL
OF MEDICINE. I SUPPORT 109. I HAVE WITNESSED THE INHUMANITY OF THE
OCCUPATION. IN 2007, A HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS DELEGATION, I MET
12 YEAR OLD MUHAMMAD. 50 POUNDS AND BLIND AND DISABLED DUE TO A
LACK OF OXYGEN. IN THE HOSPITAL, THE MOTHER COULDN'T PASS THE
CHECKPOINT AND AFTER FIVE HOURS SHE DELIVERED A CHOKING BLUE BABY.
IT TOOK TWO HOURS THE FOR THE AMBULANCE TO REACH THEM. WERE
THEY COMPENSATED? NO. ISRAELI ARE DENIED BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND
OVER SIX YEARS, AT LEAST 69 BIRTHS AT CHECKPOINTS, FIVE WOMEN AND 35
NEWBORNS DIED. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO TO JON RUSSELL.
>> HI. 37 PERRY STREET. A BLACK RESIDENT OF SOMERVILLE AND WORKED IN
CAMBRIDGE SEVERAL YEARS. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 109 AND
114. I THINK ANY THE HEART PROGRAM IS AMAZING, ANY COMMUNITY
PROCESS THAT IS TRANSPARENT THAT IS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE
COMMUNITY SHOULD PROTECT ITSELF, SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE
COMMUNITY. POLICE DO NOT KEEP BLACK, BROWN, OR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
SAFE. WE KEEP OUR OWN COMMUNITY SAFE. IN THAT SAME LINE, FOR
DECADES, YOU HAD THE SAME BLACK, BROWN, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE THAT
FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION FROM THE POLICE. THEY ALL HAVE
SOLIDARITY OF PALESTINIANS IN THE PROTECTION OF THEIR STATE. TONI
MORRISON, ET CETERA, ALL SUPPORT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND WE
SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY BY DIVESTING FROM HP AND ANYBODY ELSE
WHO SUPPORTS THE ISRAELI APARTHEID STATE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: RABBI LEORA.
>> RABBI ABELSON HAS NOT JOINED. NEXT, GO AHEAD.
>> TALA, I'M A PALESTINIAN WORKING AT HARVARD FOR THREE YEARS. I
WANT TO URGE YOU TO PASS POLICY ORDER 109 TO END PURCHASING FROM
HP. LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU HOW HP UPHOLDS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
AND I TOLD YOU AS AN AMERICAN, THE U.S. FUNDS THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION
AND THIS IS NOT JUST INTERNATIONAL. AS A CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY
MEMBER, I'M KNOW THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A
LEADER FOR JUSTICE AND TO DO THIS, YOU MUST SUPPORT POLICY 109. I
SUPPORT 114 FOR THE HEART PROGRAM. WE KNOW THAT THE PALESTINIAN
AND BLACK COMMUNITIES HAVE LONG BEEN IN SOLIDARITY AND FIGHTING
THE SAME OPPRESSOR. FOR ANY CITY COUNCILLOR SUPPORTING ONE AND


PAGE 4

May 24, 2021

NOT THE OTHER, THE COMMUNITY SEES YOUR HYPOCRISY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NATE?
>> I LIVE IN SOMERVILLE. 23 HAROLD STREET. AS AN AMERICAN JEW, I WILL
MAKE IT CLEAR THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DOESN'T REPRESENT ME AND NOT
THE SPOKESPERSON FOR JEWS. CONFUSE UNDERINFORMED LIBERAL TO
MAKE THEM THINK IT IS NOT OKAY TO SPEAK UP. IT IS NO WAY ANTISEMITIC
TO OPPOSE A STATE THAT CARRIES OUT ETHNIC CLEANSING AND I REFUSE
TO ALLOW SUPPORT OF MY COMMUNITY TO USE AN ORDER TO PROVIDE
COVER FOR THE ATROCITIES. I'M HERE IS TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDERS 109
AND 114. YOU CAN DIVEST FROM HP AND RETHINK PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS
INTERTWINED WITH THE STRUGGLES HERE IN THE U.S. THE SAME
TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES USE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. LEA?
>> HI, I'M PALESTINIAN, FORMER CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND INCOMING
STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. I KNOW FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS,
SOME FOLKS MAY TRY TELL YOU THAT THE POLICY ORDERS ARE COMPLEX OR
CONTROVERSIAL. THEY ARE NOT. THIS IS VERY SIMPLE. BOTH OF THE
PROPOSALS ARE ABOUT RESPECTING OUR DIGNITY. LET'S BE CLEAR. THE
MACHINERY OF POLICING HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OCCUPATION IN
PALESTINE THAT HP THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED. BLACK RESIDENTS FACE
INDIGNITY AS POLICING AS PALESTINIANS AT HOME. BY SUPPORTING THE
HEART PROGRAM CRAFTED BY BLACK AND BROWN AND DIVESTING FROM HP,
HEEDING THE CALL FROM PALESTINIANS, CAMBRIDGE CAN BE PART OF A
HISTORICAL PEOPLE'S LED MOVEMENT. REJECT RACISM AND DEMAND
DIGNITY FOR ALL. THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY
ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WILLIAM?
>> WILLIAM AND JOHN HAVE NOT JOINED. HUDA, GO AHEAD. UNMUTE
YOURSELF.
>> HELLO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> I'M READING TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF (UNKNOWN NAME). I'M A
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS POLICY
ORDER 109 ON THE CITY'S PURCHASING OF HP AND THE OTHER COMPANIES
COMPLICIT IN APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS AS WELL AS POLICY ORDER
114. ON THE HEART PROGRAM. SOMEONE WITH AN IMMIGRANT MOTHER,
WITH LOVED ONES WHO SUFFER FROM THE UNETHICAL SURVEILLANCE OF
ICE TRACKING SYSTEMS, I WANT TO LIVE IN A CITY THAT PRIORITIZE RIGHTS AS
WELL AS THE COMMUNITY DEMANDS OF BLACK, BROWN, AND LOW INCOME
COMMUNITIES, I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS POLICY ORDER.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: AMIRA?
>> HELLO. I WORK AT THE MUSLIM JUSTICE A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION


PAGE 5

May 24, 2021

ACROSS THE GREATER BOSTON AREA. WE ORGANIZE WITH MUSLIMS IN ALL
COMMUNITIES DEEMED SUSPECT OF SURVEILLANCE. CAMBRIDGE MUST END
CONTRACTS WITH ALL COMPANIES THAT UPHOLD SYSTEMS THAT WE
WATCH IN HORROR AS IT WAS RAIDED BY ISRAELI FORCES AND THEY ARE
TARGETED WITH WAR GAS.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
HP IS NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHT VIOLENCE, THEY CREATE THE
TECHNOLOGY. THAT SIMPLE. MANY MOVEMENTS USE DIVESTMENT AND
BOYCOTT AS TOOL TO CHIP AWAY AND THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. YOU MUST
INVEST IN SAFETY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. RABBI YONI?
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR, GO AHEAD. (SILENCE) YOU ARE UNMUTED. GO
AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL COME BACK?
>> CAROLINE HUNTER.
>> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. I COME TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 6 TO
ELIMINATE CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES LIKE HP, WHICH PROFIT OFF THE
ISRAELI VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIANS. I SPEAK AS SOMEONE WHO
ORGANIZED THE FIRST BOYCOTT AGAINST A UNITED STATES CORPORATION
THAT SUPPORTED AN APARTHEID THROUGH PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.
THAT LED TO THE DISINVESTMENT OF POLAROID. WE ALSO STOOD THIS
COUNCIL STOOD WITH SOUTH AFRICA IN 1979 WITH THE HISTORIC VOTE TO
DIVEST. I ASK YOU TO DO THE SAME. I DO NOT WANT MY TAX DOLLARS TIED
TO THE INJUSTICES LINKED TO THE APARTHEID STATE OF ISRAEL JUST AS I DID
WITH SOUTH AFRICA. I URGE YOU TO TAKE THE LEAD AND STAND ON THE
BEHALF OF JUSTICE AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIANS. THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO GET A PEACEFUL SOLUTION AND THE RIGHTS FOR THOSE OPPRESSED
BY THE SYSTEM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ITAMAR?
>> MAYOR, WILLIE HAS JOINED. CAN WE GO TO THEM FIRST AND THEN
ITAMAR?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WILLIAM AND THEN ITAMAR.
>> CAN I BE HEARD? GREAT. GREETINGS. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO UPHOLD
A PROMISE I MADE YEARS AGO BY SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER
109. THIS IS PERSONAL AS A BLACK AMERICAN, I SEE HOW RACIST SANCTION
VIOLENCE WILL RIP APART COMMUNITIES AND HUMAN BEINGS. TWO YEARS
AGO I WAS IN PALESTINE, I WITNESSED APARTHEID FORCES CONDUCTING
RAIDS TO VILLAGES. I HAVE BEEN TO THE VILLAGES, WHERE DECADES OF
ISRAELI DISPOSITION HAS THREATENED THE PEOPLE AND I HAVE SEEN THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE'S COMPASSION AND RESISTANCE. I PROMISE THEN I
WOULD WORK TO END THE HORRORS THEY EXPERIENCE, WHICH ARE
ENABLED BY U.S. COMPANIES AND TAXPAYERS. I KNOW GLOBAL JUSTICE IS
OUR LOCAL RESPONSIBLE. IT IS THAT OR NOTHING. IT IS UP TO YOU TO LIVE


PAGE 6

May 24, 2021

UP DUTIES BY PUTTING FORWARD THIS MOTION AND END CONTRACTS WITH
HP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ITAMAR?
>> HELLO. OXFORD STREET. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION AND
POLICY ORDER INVOLVING STOPPING CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES DOING
BUSINESS WITH SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S OCCUPATION PALESTINE. I DO SO AS
A JEW AND SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN ISRAEL. AND STILL HAS FAMILY
LIVING IN ISRAEL.
I HEARD SOME OPPONENTS TALK ABOUT THIS AS SINGLING OUT ISRAEL AND I
FIND IT A LITTLE CONFUSING SINCE JUST BECAUSE ONE COUNTRY IS BEING
ASKED TO DO BETTER, IT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T ASK OTHER. THE CITY
COUNCIL ON MANY OCCASIONS HAVE SPOKEN IN SUPPORT OF OTHER
CAUSES. I'M EXCITED TO SEE PROJECTS FOR MOVING AWAY FROM
MILITARIZING POLICING. I HOPE YOU WILL PASS THEM AS WELL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SHARONE?
>> MAYOR, RABBI YONI HAS JOINED US FROM A DIFFERENT COMPUTER. I
WILL UNMUTE RABBI.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. ARE YOU THERE?
>> YOU JUST NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> YOU CAN HEAR ME? HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> WE CAN HEAR YOU. GO AHEAD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I DON'T THINK HE CAN HEAR US. WE CAN HEAR YOU,
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HEAR US. MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING. GO TO SHARONE AND GO BACK.
>> HELLO. 21 KELLY ROAD. I'M HERE TO URN THE CITY COUNCIL TO OPPOSE
RESOLUTION 109. THIS RESOLUTION TREATS A COMPLEX CONFLICT WITH A
PAINFUL HISTORY AS A ONE SIDED ISSUE. IT POLARIZES THE NARRATIVE OF
THE CONFLICT AND BY DOING SO, WILL CREATE BARRIERS TO PEACE. FOR
EXAMPLE, THE RESOLUTION DOESN'T MENTION THE ACTIONS OF HAMAS,
RECOGNIZED TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT USES HUMANITARIAN AID TO
LAUNCH ROCKETS AT CIVILIANS. PLEASE VOTE AGAINST THIS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE AMAHL.
(TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY PLEASE HOLD)
>> I THE URGE THE COUNCIL TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. THERE HAVE
BEEN INCIDENTS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA. AS A JEWISH AMERICAN,
WITH AMERICAN ISRAELI PARENTS, I BELIEVE THIS POLICY ORDER WILL
CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING CAMBRIDGE A CITY KNOWN FOR ITS TOLERANCE.
FEEL UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR JEWISH AMERICANS AND ISRAELI. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO TRY TO THE RABBI ONCE MORE AND THEN

May 24, 2021

DAVID ROTH.
>> OKAY. I'M AN MIT RESEARCHER AND LIVE IN CENTRAL SQUARE. I
SUPPORT AND ENDORSE THE APPROACH OF BIDEN IN TWO AREAS.
CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ETHNIC GROUPS, WORKING WITH
ALLIES TO ADDRESS MUTUAL CONCERNS. IT IS HANDLED AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL BEST AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. BDS WILL MAKE JEWISH
PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AS A MEANS OF HATRED AND IMPEDES POSITIVE
CONSTRUCTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING. ISRAELI HAS PRIORITIZE VACCINATION
FOR THE CITIZENS, DOCTORS AND NURSES TREATMENT OF MUSLIMS AND
JEWS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DAVID ROTH.
>> HELLO. I HAVE LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 13 YEARS. I LIVE AT 13 MARIE
AVENUE. I LIKE TO BEGIN BY TELLING YOU WHAT SEEMS LIKE A NORMAL
PEACE OF CIVIC ACTIVITY, SHARING MY NAME AND ADDRESS. IT HAS BECOME
SOMETHING DANGEROUS. SHARING MY ADDRESS PUBLICLY IN THE PROCESS
OF EXTREME ATTACKS IN ISRAELI AND ON JEWS MAKES ME AFRAID OF MY
SAFETY AND FOR MY FAMILY. I LIVED IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT WASN'T SAFE
TO BE VISIBLY JEWISH AND I HAVE WARNED NOT TO WEAR CLOTHING THAT
WILL MAKE ME A TARGET. UNFAIR ATTACKS ON ISRAEL, SINGLING OUT THE
JEWISH STATE, IT MAKES PEACE HARDER TO ACHIEVE AND LEADS AGAIN AND
AGAIN TO THE SINGLING OUT OF JEWS FOR VIOLENCE. DON'T ALLOW OUR
CITY TO WEAPONIZED FOR ONE SIDE OF A COMPLEX AND TRAGIC CONFLICT. I
ASK MY CITY NOT CHOOSE NOT TO ALIGN ITSELF WITH FORCES TO
UNDERMINE CHANCES OF PEACE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. I WILL REMIND YOU,
IF YOUR HAND IS UP, WE'RE GOING TO YOU IN THE ORDER YOU SIGN UP. YOU
DON'T HAVE TO RAISE YOUR HAND. A LOT OF PEOPLE RAISING HANDS.
WE'RE GOING WE ARE TRYING TO GO IN THE ORDER FOLKS SIGNED UP.
AICHA IS NEXT. ARE YOU THERE?
>> I'M HERE. HI, I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE SINCE I WAS SEVEN. I'M A MEMBER
OF CAMBRIDGE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST OF AMERICA. AND I'M IN SUPPORT
OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS MUSLIM JUSTICE LEAGUE AND BDS
BOSTON. I'M HERE TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109
AND POLICY ORDER 114 IN SUPPORT OF THE HEART PROGRAM.
THE OPPRESSION OF BLACK FOLKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE
OPPRESSION OF PALESTINIAN IN THE ISRAELI STATE ARE DEEPLY
INTERCONNECTED. AS THE SAME TACTICS ARE USED ON BOTH POPULATIONS,
UNITED STATES POLICE ARE TRAINED BY ISRAELI POLICE, ISRAELI POLICE TRAIN
UNITED STATES POLICE. IT IS VICE VERSA. THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED AND
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT BOTH POLICIES OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROTECT
AND SUPPORT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: RAMI IS NEXT.
>> I'M A JEWISH REFUGEE FROM AN ARAB COUNTRY WHO CAME TO THE
UNITED STATES SAFETY THAT IS THREATENED BY THE BDS MOVEMENT.

May 24, 2021

POLICY ORDER 2021, 109, IS A BDS BEST RESOLUTION INFORMED BY BIGOTRY
BY THE JEWISH STATE ON THE PLANET. AND ENDANGER THE MEMBER OF THE
JEWISH COMMUNITY AND OTHER MINORITIES IN EVERYWHERE. FOR THE
PAST 40 YEARS, I HAVE WORKED EVERY DAY IN CAMBRIDGE. WE DO NOT
WANT THIS HATRED IMPORTED TO CAMBRIDGE. THE COUNCIL MUST REJECT
THE RESOLUTION. THE RESOLUTION WILL INSPIRE EXTRA VIOLENCE WHERE
PEOPLE ARE SAYING KILL JEWS AND RAPE JEWISH WOMEN AND I HAVE LIVED
IN COUNTRIES WHERE THIS HAPPENED. PLEASE REJECT THIS RESOLUTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE SARAH.
>> THANK YOU. I LIVE ON MAGAZINE STREET. I'M HERE AS A TEN YEAR
RESIDENT AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY RELATIONS
COUNCIL. THE DIVERSE JEWISH ORGANIZATION OF GREATER BOSTON. WE
REPRESENTS SOME 130 CONGREGATIONS AND CIVIL AND CULTURAL GROUPS.
I WOULD WELCOME OUR CITY HAVING A HUMAN RIGHTS LENS THAT IS
APPLIED NEUTRALLY TO ALL NATIONS AND CONTRACTS. THE PROPONENTS OF
109 MAKE CLEAR IS A VICTORY FOR GLOBAL MOVEMENT THAT WILL
ELIMINATE THE STATE OF ISRAEL. WE OPPOSE ORDER 109 AND SING... OUT
THE JEWISH STATE. WE THANK YOU FOR THE REQUEST FOR RELIGIOUS
ACCOMMODATION AND ALLOWING MORE RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE
TONIGHT IN THIS DISCUSSION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HARVEY?
>> YOU HAVE TO UPDATE YOUR ZOOM VERSION. AND COME BACK IN, RAISE
YOUR HAND AND WE'LL CALL ON YOU.
>> I LIVE AT 56 CEDAR STREET. IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDER 109
TERMINATING THE CONTRACT WITH HP AND OTHER COMPANIES COMPLICIT
IN VIOLATIONS OF PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. PALESTINIANS ARE ASKING FOR
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY BY CONTINUING TO WORK WITH
THE COMPANIES, CAMBRIDGE WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE OPPRESSION AND
VIOLATION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS IN PALESTINE AND IN THE UNITED
STATES.
AS A DAUGHTER OF TWO MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS, IT IS HURTFUL TO LIVE IN A
CITY THAT SUPPORTS CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES THAT ASSIST PRISON, ICE
IN TRACKING DETAINING FOLKS THAT DESERVE LOVE AND RESPECT. WE
CONTINUE TO OFFER VIOLENCE AGAINST, I URGE YOU TO PASS POLICY ORDER
109 AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO ACTIVELY END VIOLENCE AGAINST
BIPOC FOLK IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO MARIA.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY TO
SPEAK AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109. I HAVE WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR A
NUMBER OF YEARS. I'M A FORMER RESEARCH FELLOW AT HARVARD AND I'M
AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT BENTLEY. AN AMERICAN JEW AND A MOTHER OF
THREE CHILDREN. I CAME TO THE COUNTRY AS A REFUGEE TO ESCAPE
ANTISEMITISM AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE ANTISEMITISM ON THE
GOVERNMENT LEVEL. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE I'M WITNESSING THE SAME


PAGE 9

May 24, 2021

AGENDA ON THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL IN THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS POLICY ORDER IS WRONG.
ISRAELI WAS UNDER ATTACK FROM HAMAS. ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO
DEFEND ITSELF. THE LOVED ONES ARE UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK. I HAVE
HEARD FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS. I SPEND I HEAR ABOUT MY RELATIVES WELL
BEING AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. I'M SORRY
EVERYBODY HAS A MINUTE. YAEL?
>> HI. I'M HERE TO OPPOSE AGENDA ITEM 129 AND 109. I'M AN ISRAELI
AMERICAN AND HAVE SEEN ALL THE PROPAGANDA THAT HAS BEEN DONE
LATELY. AND WORDS SUCH AS APARTHEID, GENOCIDE, THEY ARE FACTUALLY
WRONG. FURTHER, THERE IS ONLY ONE JEWISH STATE IN THE WORLD, ONLY
ONE PLACE WHERE THE JEWS CAN LIVE UNDER THEIR JEWISH LAW AND
UNDER JEWISH GOVERNMENT. THAT IS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO BOYCOTT. WE HAVE HORRENDOUS SOCIAL RIGHT
VIOLATIONS IN CHINA AND NOBODY IS TRYING TO BOYCOTT CHINA. WE HAVE
VIOLATIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND NOBODY TRIES TO BOYCOTT THEM.
THERE'S ONE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO
BOYCOTT, THAT IS ISRAEL. THE ONLY JEWISH STATE IN THE WORLD AND THE
ONLY REASON THEY ARE TRYING TO BOYCOTT IS ANTISEMITISM. THIS IS
ANTIDISCRIMINATORY AND AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NOAM.
>> I HAVE BEEN A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR SIX YEARS. AND I'M JEWISH. I
OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS BECAUSE OF THE CORROSIVE EFFECT THEY HAD
ON THE CITY. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, LOOK AT THE DISPLAY FOR THE
ZOOM MEETING. THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE DISPLAYED AND I
CAN'T SAY I KNOW FOR SURE FROM THE DECISION WAS MADE TO HIDE THE
PUBLIC COMMENT DISPLAY, AFTER WATCHING THE RECENT VIOLENCE
TOWARDS JEW, VIOLENCE STEMMING FROM THE DEMONIZATION EMBEDDED
IN THE POLICY ORDER, I'M WORRIED ABOUT REVEALING MY ADDRESS AND
BEING TARGETED. I CAN TELL YOU, I'M NOT ALONE. AND LET ME JUST BE
CLEAR, THIS POLICY ORDER, THIS IS NOT INCLUSION OR JUSTICE, THIS IS NOT
THE CAMBRIDGE I HAVE KNOWN, NOR THE CAMBRIDGE IN WHICH I WANT TO
LIVE. AND TO THE COUNCIL, I ASK VERY SIMPLY... YOU SEE THAT EMPTY SLOT.
FILL THAT SLOT WITH EMPATHY AND PLEASE STAND UP FOR YOUR
NEIGHBORS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JESSE?
>> HELLO. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND A GRADUATE OF HARVARD LAW
SCHOOL. I'M A GRANDCHILD OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. I OPPOSE THE
POLICY ORDERS. I THINK THEY ARE GROSSLY ONE SIDED AND UNFAIR. I DON'T
THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO BE FAIR. WHAT MESSAGE DOES IT SEND WHEN
THE CITY DOESN'T TRY TO BE FAIR TOWARD ISRAEL? IRONICALLY, ADOPTING
THE RESOLUTIONS WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN THE CASE FOR THE EXISTENCE AS
THE WORD'S ONLY JEWISH STATE. WHO ELSE CAN JEWS COUNT ON WHEN
THE HOUR OF NEED ARRIVES? THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE? I DON'T THINK SO.


PAGE 10

May 24, 2021

THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JJ KIMCHE?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK
IN SOME OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL OF BOYCOTTING OF ISRAEL. IN THE
PAST WEEKS, THE LARGEST JEWISH COMMUNITY SUFFERED OVER 4,000
MISSILES FIRED BY HAMAS. A GROUP BENT ON MURDERING ALL JEWS
EVERYWHERE. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S A 500% INCREASE IN
ANTISEMITIC ATTACKS IN EUROPE AND IN THE UNITED STATES. TO
INTRODUCE BDS AT THIS TIME WILL TELL THE WORD CAMBRIDGE,
MASSACHUSETTS, SIDES WITH THE ANTI SEMITES IT WILL JOIN IN THE
PROJECT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE JEWISH STATE, THIS TIME BY
ECONOMIC MEANS AND IT WILL WISH TO PUNISH JEWS BY DEFENDING
THEMSELVES. DOES CAMBRIDGE WANT TO JOIN THE PERSECUTORS AND IN
NAZI GERMANY, DECLARING IT IS OKAY TO SINGLE OUT JEWS FOR
PUNISHMENT AND ABUSE. IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A FRIEND OF THE
JEWISH PEOPLE, I ASK YOU PLEASE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JACKSON.
>> HI, THERE. I'M A LONG TIME CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND COMMUNITY
MEMBER. I'M LIVING IN NORTH GRAFTON AT THIS MOMENT. I'M EXCITED TO
MOVE BACK TO CAMBRIDGE IN JULY. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES TO CUT TIES
WITH HP UNTIL THE COMPANY STOPS THE SHAMEFUL PROFITING FROM
DISCRETION OF THE PALESTINIAN. I WILL VOICE MY SUPPORT OF POLICY
ORDER 114, MAKE CAMBRIDGE A SAFER SPACE FOR BLACK AND BROWN
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I SPEAK AS THE JEWISH AMERICAN WHO HAS SPENT
TIME IN PALESTINE WHERE I WITNESS THE UNBEARABLE HORRORS, HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ARCHITECTURE OF DEATH THAT THEY FACE EVERY
DAY. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE ANTIZIONISM IS NOT THE SAME AS
ANTISEMITISM AND VERY DANGEROUS TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS SO. TO
SUPPORT THIS IS NOT ANTISEMETIC.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MENACHEM?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? PEARL STREET. RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. SPEAKING
UP IN OPPOSITION TO 109. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE UN HAS
CONFIRMED THAT HAMAS PUTS ROCKETS INTO ITS SCHOOLS AND USES
CHILDREN AS SHIELDS. THIS IS ABOUT THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE.
ANTISEMITISM IS ON THE RISE. THE ONE SIDED RHETORIC, THAT STATED IN
THE CITY COUNCIL, THIS IS NOT A TWO SIDED CONVERSATION IS A DIRECT
ATTEMPT TO SHIELD THEM FROM THE COMPLICIT THAT TAKES PLACE. IT IS A
VERY SIMPLE QUESTION. IF YOU INSIST ON A ONE SIDED RHETORIC, YOU ARE
AN INVITING THAT TYPE OF HATE INTO THE CITY, INTO THE COMMUNITY.
JEWS IN NEW YORK AND L.A. ARE BEING HUNTED AND CHASED AND RIGHT
HERE, I'M BEING VERBALLY ABUSED IN THE STREETS OF CAMBRIDGE BECAUSE
I'M JEWISH. PLEASE DON'T HELP THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JULIE?
>> MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE FOR 30 YEARS.

RESIDENTS. I'M HERE TO CONDEMN BDS AND OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER.
AND THE REFERENCE TO HP, WHICH IS NOT A CAMBRIDGE VENDOR, IS IN
REALITY A SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISRAEL AND IMPLYING THINGS THAT
ARE UNTRUE. I FIND THAT THE HARDEST BLOWS ARE THE ONES THAT COME
FROM THE CLOSEST RANGE. AND THESE BLOWS ARE COMING FROM SOME
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THOSE ON THIS CALL. EVERYONE DESERVES
RESPECT AND HUMAN DIGNITY, YOUR ACTION SHOW YOU RESPECT PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT. THE CONSTITUENTS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ARE
UNSAFE. THE LEVEL OF ANGER AND HATE SPILLS OVER IN CAMBRIDGE. SOME
STOKE THE ANGER AND REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SEQUENCES,
CAMBRIDGE IS NOT THE SANCTUARY IT PRETENDS TO BE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE HAVE MARK.
>> GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU. MASS AVENUE. AND I'M SPEAKING IN
OPPOSITION TO POLICY ORDER 109. A FRIEND SENT A PHOTO FROM AN
ADVERTISEMENT IN ISRAEL YESTERDAY. FROM INSURANCE COMPANY. HUGE
LETTERS IT SAID THE BEST INSURANCE AGAINST VIOLENCE IS CO EXISTENCE.
THIS IS MOSTLY CORRECT. THERE IS NO PROSPECT FOR PEACE BETWEEN THE
RIVER AND THE SEA IF THE COURSE CONTINUES AS IT HAS. AND AS A COURSE
OF ACTION, BDS IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE SAME. IT IS AN ACT OF
VIOLENCE BY NON PHYSICAL MEANS. PROPONENTS OF ACTION LIKE THIS
UNDER THE GUISE OF NONVIOLENCE, ARE NEITHER CREATIVE OR
COURAGEOUS TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS. WE SEEK POLITICAL
LEADERS THAT EXACERBATE CONFLICT. MY WRITTEN STATEMENT I SENT LAST
NIGHT TO THE MEMBERS EXTENDS CERTAIN IDEAS, WHICH I WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. LIAT?
>> HI. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR ME. AND THE YEAR I WAS
BORN, BORN IN NEW YORK BEFORE THE FAMILY MOVED TO ISRAEL AND I'M A
PROUD ISRAELI AMERICAN. AND I WORK AS A REGISTERED NURSE AT MASS
GENERAL HOSPITAL. IT IS A REALLY SCARY YEAR AND HALF. A LOT OF MY
PATIENTS DIED OF COVID. I WORKED AS A COVID 19 NURSE. LAST YEAR,
OVER THE HOLIDAY, MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THE PATIENT IN MY CARE AND THEY
WOULD DIE. THIS YEAR, LAST WEEK, ON MONDAY OVER THE HOLIDAY, MY
BIGGEST FEAR IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT I COULDN'T SPEAK ABOUT
AT THIS MEETING. I HAVE BEEN PROUD OF MY NAME, THIS WEEK WHEN
PEOPLE ASK ME AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE NAME IS FROM, I TOLD THEM I
DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID. I URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST POLICY
ITEMS 109.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DANIEL?
>> HELLO. I HAVE BEEN A LONG TERM RESIDENT FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS.
MY CHILDREN GREW UP HERE AND WENT TO CRLS. I CONSIDER MYSELF A
VERY PROUD RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. I STRONGLY OPPOSE POLICY ORDER
109. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT CAMBRIDGE TO BECOME A CITY THAT IS


PAGE 12

May 24, 2021

DIVISIVE AND NEGATIVE.
I THINK THAT CAMBRIDGE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. PEOPLE CLAIM
ANTIZIONISM INSTEAD OF CAMBRIDGE FOLLOWING THE CROWD, I URGE US
TO THINK OF POSITIVE WAY TO CELEBRATE CO EXISTENCE AND MAYBE TO
SPONSOR A YEARLY FORUM WHERE PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS AND JEWS
AND MUSLIMS ARE INVITED UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF CAMBRIDGE. I
WORK FOR THAT AND REJECT THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KEREN?
>> HI. JEWISH COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SINGLED BY THIS RESOLUTION AND
CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WE DO BUSINESS WITH THAT ARE
INVOLVED IN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. LABELLING A COUNTRY WHERE
JEWISH ARAB CITIZENS ARE AFFORDED EQUAL RIGHTS APARTHEID IS
INACCURATE. DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, THE
LEADERSHIP ISRAELI PULL THE JEWS OUT OF GAZA AND HAND OVER THE
LAND FOR PEOPLE THAT ELECT HAMAS. SHOOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
MISSILES FUNDED BY IRAN INTO ISRAEL AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAWS
ATTACK TO CIVILIANS. THIS CONFLICT FROM ONE ANGLE IS A DISSERVICE
FROM ALL INVOLVED. I CARE FOR ALL RIGHTS AND I WON'T
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NOAH?
>> COLONIALISM, EUROPEANS CARRIED OUT MASS ENSLAVEMENT AND
GENOCIDE AND BUILD A WORLD OF INEQUALITY. A SYSTEM OF WHITE
SUPREMACY. YOU HAVE COLONIAL SETTLEMENT AS PRACTICED HERE BY THE
STATE OF ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA. PLACES WITH A LONG HISTORY OF
SUPPORTING EACH OTHER AND THEIR POLICIES OF COLONIAL VIOLENCE AND
MASS IMPRISONMENTS. THE POLICY ORDERS CONNECTED. HP'S
TECHNOLOGY FOR TRACKING SURVEILLING AND IMPRISONING COMMUNITIES
HERE AND IN COLONIZED PALESTINE WILL PROTECT THE SYSTEM OF WHITE
SUPREMACY. THE ENCLAVES OF A DYING COLONIALISM. YOU CAN BE ON THE
SIDE OF THE ENCLAVES, YOU CAN SIDE WITH THE RISING TIDE AGAINST THEM.
THOSE ARE THE TWO SIDES. YOUR VOTE WILL TELL US WHICH SIDE YOU ARE
ON.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO RABBI...
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO OUR VOICES. I'M THE RABBI
OF A SYNAGOGUE WHOSE MEMBERS LIVE ACROSS THE BOSTON, INCLUDING
CAMBRIDGE. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109. IT IS
NOT ANTISEMITIC, IT CAN FEEL ANTIJEWISH, MY ANCESTORS HELP BUILD THE
JEWISH STATE, IT DOESN'T TARGET ISRAELI OR JEWS AS INDIVIDUALS. IT WILL
TARGET COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES THAT ENABLE OCCUPATION AND
APARTHEID AND ESSENTIAL STRATEGY FOR NONVIOLENCE EXISTENCE. HP
MAKES MONEY BY SERVING SYSTEMS OF DEHUMANIZATION AND INJUSTICE
AND CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE PROUD TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH
THEM.
HOW POWERFUL THAT TONIGHT YOU ARE CONSIDERING TWO POLICY
CHANGES IN SERVICE OF TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM SYSTEMS THAT HARM


PAGE 13

May 24, 2021

PEOPLE AND MOVE IT TOWARD THE SYSTEM THAT PROTECT AND UPLIFT
PEOPLE. I HOPE YOU WILL PASS BOTH.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SANJAY?
>> HI. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY
ORDER. BOTH THE POLICY ORDERS ARE INTERTWINED THEY BOTH ATTEMPT
TO TACKLE RACIST ABUSE BY ISRAELI SETTLER COLONIALIST AS WELL AS THE
U.S. POLICE AND ICE. THE ISRAELI MILITARY AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
USE HP SERVICES TO ENFORCE SEGREGATION AND TRACKING OF ETHNIC
GROUPS. THIS IS ABUSE OF PALESTINIANS AND IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF
COLOR IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS AS WELL AS THE POLICE IN THE UNITED
STATES ARE ONE IN THE SAME. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON BOTH ORDERS IF
YOU ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO ABOLISHING APARTHEID.
>> HI, EVERYBODY. GEORGE. PALESTINIAN AMERICAN LIVING ON
SOMERVILLE AVENUE AND EMPLOYEE OF HARVARD AND PROFESSOR AT
EMERSON. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ORDERS 109 AND 114. AN
ENGINEER, I HAVE WITNESSED HOW FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT TECH
INDUSTRY HAS BECOME ON UNITED STATES MILITARY AND WESTERN EMPIRE.
HP HAS ALWAYS BUILT AND SUPPLY THE TOOLS OF OPPRESSION FROM ICE TO
THE ISRAELI STATE, YET BDS WILL GIVE SIMPLE STRATEGIES TO RESIST THE
OCCUPATION AND THE MILITARY AT LARGE. RESIDENTS HAVE NOTHING
MATERIAL TO LOSE BY IMPLEMENTING THE ORDER. NOTHING, PALESTINIANS
HAVE EVERYTHING TO LOSE, THEIR HOMES, THEIR LIVELIHOODS. AND I HOPE
CAMBRIDGE WILL LISTENS TO THE RESIDENT AND DOES THE PART TO STAND
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. LIBERATION IS NOT IMPLAUSIBLE, BUT IT IS
INEVITABLE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ISAAC?
>> THANK YOU. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. FOSTER STREET. I WILL BEGIN WITH
THE CONTINUE REFERENCE THAT HP HAS NO PLACE IN THE CONVERSATION.
WITH THAT SAID, FOR MANY YEARS, I'M AN ACTIVE SUPPORT OF TWO STAGE
SOLUTION TO ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN PEACE. I HAVE BEEN TO THE WEST
BANK. I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN ARABS AND JEWISH,
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS. I EXPRESS TO YOU MY OPPOSITION FOR 109, IT
IS BUILD POLICY AND WILL NOT HELP THEM ACHIEVE THE PEACE AND SELF
DETERMINATION THAT DESERVE AND DESIRE. IT IS A POOR ATTEMPT TO
MAKE CAMBRIDGE A PART OF THE MOVEMENT. AND IRONICALLY,
EXACERBATES THE VERY CONFLICT IT PURPORTS TO ADDRESS. PLEASE DON'T
SUPPORT THE MEASURES. THEY DON'T HELP THE CAUSE OF PEACE AND
CREATE A DIVISIVE AND HOSTILE CLIMATE. THEY WILL ALSO AFFECT THE
REPUTATION NEGATIVELY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IRENE?
>> I'M IRENE. I RESIDE IN CAMBRIDGE. WE SUBMITTED A LETTER OPPOSING
POLICY ORDER 109, SIGNED BY 250 CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS, BUT OUT OF THE
TIME, THEY CHOSE TO SIGN THE LETTER IN LIEU OF TESTIFYING.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. LOREN?
>> HI. MUSEUM WAY IN EAST CAMBRIDGE. I'M ONE OF THE PETITIONERS
FOR THE CONSERVATION DISTRICT DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND ACCESS PETITION
AND I REQUEST THE COUNCIL SEND IT TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE. OUT
OF RESPECT FOR TONIGHT'S AGENDA, WE DIDN'T ORGANIZE COMMENT, BUT
WE CAN COLLABORATE AS PART OF THE ORDINANCE PROCESS. AS A MEMBER
OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE, THE COUNCIL HAS PURPORTED TWO
PROPOSALS TO BUILD ALTERNATIVE DEPARTMENTS TO THE POLICE. AS A
MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE THAT WROTE ONE, I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT
BOTH. THE PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE IS PROPOSAL FOR DEPARTMENT OF
COMMUNITY SAFETY AND THE BLACK RESPONSE PROPOSAL ARE THE SAME IN
TERMS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. IT MAKES SENSE SINCE BOTH ARE
BASED ON THE CAHOOTS PROGRAM. THE TAKEAWAY FOR THE COUNCIL,
THERE'S BROAD COMMUNITY CONSENSUS THAT CAMBRIDGE SHOULD HAVE A
PROGRAM OF OUR OWN. THERE IS ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THE CORE IDEAS
THAT THE CITY CAN LAY THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH TO BUILD NOW AND
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE WILL GO TO NANCY?
>> HELLO. NANCY MURRAY, LIVED ON EERIE STREET. I SPEAK IN FAVOR OF
109, SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN HOW HP ACCESS CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
FRAGMENTED THE WEST BANK AND TURN THE GAZA STRIP INTO A CLOSED
PRISON. AS FORMER DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR ACLU, I CAMPAIGN
AGAINST THE WIRETAPPING PROGRAM AND THE EXPANSION OF ICE
DEPORTATIONS. BOTH UNDER HP TECHNOLOGY. AND I ASK THIS COUNCIL TO
SUPPORT PO 129, URGING THE MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSIONAL
DELEGATION TO STAND WITH REPRESENTATIVE PRESLEY AND ENDORSE THE
BILL. HR 2590. OUR TAX DOLLARS SHOULDN'T BE USED. I URGE YOU TO
LOOK AT HUMAN RIGHTS SWATCH DOCUMENTING ISRAELI APARTHEID
PRACTICES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO JANET.
>> HELLO. I'M JANET. I LIVE ON KIRK LYNN STREET. AND I OPPOSE POLICY
ORDER 109 AND 114. I URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME. I HAVE BEEN A TAX
PAYING RESIDENT FOR OVER 40 YEARS. AND I RECENT THE HIJACKING OF MY
CITY GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT A POLITICAL AGENDA, WHICH IS AT BEST
CONTROVERSIAL AND AT THE CORE ANTI SEMITIC AND DISTORTS THE TRUTH
OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. I WORRY HOW THIS WILL AFFECT THE
REPUTATION OF OUR CITY AS HAS BEEN SHARED BY MANY OF OUR SPEAKERS
ALREADY.
HOW UNFORTUNATE FOR THE COUNCIL'S MEMBER GOOD INTENTION TO BE
MISGUIDED TO ADOPT THIS RESOLUTION, UNDER THE CLOAK GUISE OF
PROGRESSIVE CONSCIOUS. HAMAS THEMSELVES OPPOSE OR VIOLATE THEIR

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. DANA?
>> HI. DANA, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT HISTORY AT BOSTON COLLEGE AND
RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. AND I HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR 13 YEARS. I
WAS BORN IN THE CITY IN THE PALESTINIAN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. I WILL
KEEP IT SHORT. I WILL SAY IMAGINE THAT OUR STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS
ISSUES A LAW BANNING ALL WOMEN RESIDING IN CAMBRIDGE TO EVER USE
THE MCGRATH O'BRIEN HIGHWAY. THE ONLY PEOPLE ALLOW TO DRIVE ARE
THE MEN OF SOMERVILLE, BY THE VIRTUE OF THEM BEING MEN, SOMEHOW
ARE ABLE TO APPROPRIATE LAND AND DISPLACE SOME WOMEN AND THE
IDEA IS THAT WOMAN ONLY BELONG IN CAMBRIDGE AND DON'T BELONG TO
SOMERVILLE. IF WE KEEP ON INVESTING IN CITIES THAT SUPPORT ISRAEL, WE
ARE NOT ONLY SEGREGATING ROSA PARKS ON THE BUS, WE ARE NOT
ALLOWING HER TO GET ON THE BUS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
SO, PLEASE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, DO NOT SUPPORT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NOOR?
>> MAYOR, AMHAL HAS JOINED? CAN WE CALL THAT NEXT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> HELLO. I PRESENTED TESTIMONY LAST WEEK. REGARDING HOW IT SPLITS
MY FAMILY AND COMMUNITIES I LOVE. YOU SOLID DIVEST AND TODAY IS
DOCUMENTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS
ORGANIZATION. WE SEE HOW ISRAEL WILL USE KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS LIKE
HP AGAINST PALESTINIANS. WE SEE THE DEATH THAT COMES FROM GUIDED
MISSILES. ISRAEL IS ARRESTING ACTIVISTS AND AS POLICE OFFICERS SUPPORT
RIGHT WING MOBS. THEY DESTROY LIVES. I'M HERE AS AN
ANTHROPOLOGIST, EXPERT, TO CLEAR UP FACTS. ANTISEMITISM IS A FORM
OF RACISM AND HATE AGAINST MY JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND WE
KNOW WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE FIGHT THE RACISM TOGETHER.
ANTIBLACK, ANTIARAB, ANTIZIONISM THEY PUT THEMSELVES ABOVE THE
RESIDENT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: FOR THOSE WHO I HAVE TO CUT OFF, YOU CAN EMAIL
THE REST OF YOUR REMARKS. THERE'S A MINUTE FOR EVERY PERSON.
GOING TO NOOR.
>> HELLO. I SERVE PATIENTS IN THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY. I'M HERE TO
ASK THE COUNCIL TO VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109 AND 114. AND NEVER
IN MY LIFE HAVE I WITNESSED A MORE HORRIFIC MONTH. MY HEART IS
BROKEN WATCHING PALESTINIANS LOSE THEIR HOME, TAX DOLLARS IS
FUNDING THIS VIOLENCE. CAMBRIDGE HAS AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO
DIVEST FROM COMPANIES LIKE HP THAT UPHOLD THE VIOLENT OCCUPATION
AND INVEST IN COMMUNITY ALTERNATIVES TO POLICE HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES. WHICH HAS TAKEN THE LIVES OF SO MANY IN THE BLACK AND
BROWN COMMUNITY. PALESTINIAN ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE
STATEMENT HEALTHCARE THE NEIGHBORS CAN ACCESS. THE STATUS

LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE LIVING IN CAMBRIDGE.
UPHOLD THE BILL. I'D BE HAPPY TO HEAR...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ESTI?
>> HELLO. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M ALSO A HISTORY AND POLITICS
TEACHER IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA. I AM OPPOSED TO BOTH POLICY
ORDER S SUGGESTED HERE TONIGHT IN RELATION TO HP AND IN RELATION
TO SUPPORTING THE TAX CUT TO ISRAEL.
I FIND THAT BOTH OF THESE POLICIES ARE VERY MUCH ROOTED IN HATE AND
ONE SIDEDNESS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT AMERICA, OUR USUAL POLICY, IT IS
THAT WE REALLY TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND INCLUDE OTHER PEOPLE.
WHY DON'T INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THEM, SUPPORT SOMETHING IN FAVOR
OF PALESTINIANS OR SOME SUPPORT OF PALESTINIANS OR IN SUPPORT OF
AN AGREEMENT OR SOLUTION TO THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI CONFLICT. I
WOULD LIKE TO PERPETUATE...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NAOMI WAS SHE DONE?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE CUT HER OFF.
>> PLEASE CONTINUE. YOU STILL HAVE THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> I GUESS I GOT CUT OFF. I THINK MY TIME WAS UP. I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK
MORE. I SAID THAT I'D LIKE TO PERPETUATE A COMMUNITY WHERE WE
ENDORSE PEACE, NOT ONE SIDEDNESS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LIOR?
>> HELLO. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. AND I RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM
ISRAEL. AND I'M HERE TO OPPOSE SUBJECT 109 AND 114. I WILL FEEL VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE LIVING IN A CITY THAT SUPPORT BDS AND THANK YOU FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP (INAUDIBLE NAME).
>> A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AT FROST STREET. I'M HERE IN
FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS. I'M AGAINST THE HP COMPLICIT IN
SEPARATING PARENTS AND CHILDREN AND TERRORIZING THE IMMIGRANT
COMMUNITY. I'M OPPOSED TO MY TAXPAYER DOLLARS FUNDING ISRAELI
APARTHEID AND THE STRATIFY CITIZENS OF PALESTINIANS. I HAVE
WITNESSED REFUGEES HOW THEY ARE TREATED BY THE ISRAELI STATE. IF
YOU SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU SET THE EXAMPLE TO DIVEST FROM HP
AND INVEST IN COMPANIES AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT OUR
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AT HOME AND ABROAD. THANK YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO LITAL?
>> HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M HERE IN MY CAPACITY AS THE ISRAELI
AMERICAN COUNCIL. MORE THAN 30,000 ISRAELI AMERICANS IN THE AREA.
MANY OF THEM LIVE AND WORK IN CAMBRIDGE. MANY OF THEM STUDY OR
TEACH IN THE CAMBRIDGE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. LOOKING AT THE
TRENDS REGARDING JEW AND ISRAEL HATRED, IT IS CLEAR THE ORDER IS
ANOTHER STEP TOWARD MAKING CAMBRIDGE AND GREATER BOSTON AN
UNWELCOMING PLACE FOR ISRAELI IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. POLICY
ORDER 109 WILL NOT ONLY HAVE AN AFFECT ON THE CURRENT FINANCIAL
AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH ISRAEL, YOU WILL FUEL THE DANGEROUS
ATMOSPHERE. IT IS ORDERS LIKE THIS THAT WILL BRING THE CLIMATE OF
VIOLENCE, BIGOTRY AND HATE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. WE OPPOSE
THE ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO MICHELLE.
>> HI, MITCHELL. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I LIVE IN HARVARD SQUARE AND I
OPPOSE POLICY ORDER 109. THIS ORDER, LIKE MANY OTHER BDS, INITIATIVES
WILL DELEGITIMIZE THE PRECEDENT SAID BY PASSING THIS ORDER WILL
TARNISH THE REPUTATION OF CAMBRIDGE. SHOULD IT PASS, MY WIFE AND I
WILL CONSIDER MOVING OUT OF CAMBRIDGE. NOT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH
ANYTHING CONNECTED TO BDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP.

>> HI. STUDENT IN HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO
OPPOSE 109 AND STRONGLY JUST LIKE I'M SO SADDENED BY THE
CONVERSATION. I INVITE EVERYBODY, I LIVE IN SOLDIER FIELD'S PARK, MAYBE
NOT EDUCATED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT ISRAEL IS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN
THE MIDDLE EAST THAT WILL PROTECT THE CITIZENS. I STUDIED ALONGSIDE
OF ISRAELI ARABS IN MY UNDER GRADUATE, TO HEAR PEOPLE CALL IT AN
APART TIED STATE IS WRONG. IT MISREPRESENTS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS. I
WANT TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE, ISRAEL HAS AN ARAB SUPREME COURT
JUDGE. AND ECHO MY FELLOW PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS ANTISEMITISM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO RABBISTERN.
>> GOOD EVENING. I HAVE BEEN IN THE PROUD RABBI OF CONGREGATION
IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 20 YEARS. AND I APPLAUD THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, THE
COUNCIL, FOR ALL THAT YOU DO TO FIGHT RACISM AND INJUSTICE. I OPPOSE
THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE I THINK BDS IS A BAD IDEA. IT IS DIVISIVE. IT
POLARIZES. IT IMPLIES THAT ISRAEL IS THE BAD GUY HERE AND WE ALL KNOW
THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED BUSINESS GOING ON OVER IN THE MIDDLE
EAST. I URGE YOU THE COUNCIL MEMBERS TO ALL CITIZENS OF CAMBRIDGE
PROUD BY BEING A LEADER IN EXPLORING HOW TO PROMOTE INITIATIVES SO
THAT ALL ISRAELIS, ALL ISRAELI CITIZENS, JEWISH AND ARAB, THEY CAN MOVE
FORWARD TOGETHER. BEING A CHANGE AGENT AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO
COMMUNICATE AND GET OUT OF GRIDLOCK.

>> HI. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORT
THE POLICY ORDER. TO END PURCHASING FROM HP BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO. TO MY FELLOW RESIDENTS WHO ARE JEWISH, I HEAR YOUR
CONCERNS AND SUPPORT YOUR RIGHT TO LIVE AND THRIVE. I MUST AFFIRM
THAT SUPPORTING PO 109 IS NOT ABOUT ANTISEMITISM. I'M THE GREAT
GRANDDAUGHTER OF GENOCIDE SURVIVORS AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
LIKE TO BE DENIED RIGHTS AND FEEL UNSAFE. BE PUNISHED FOR THE
RESISTANCE AGAINST VIOLENCE. AND I ALSO KNOW HOW HURTFUL IT IS
WHEN THE MEDIA PRESENTS A CONFLICT AS ONE BETWEEN TWO EQUAL
PARTIES. WE CAN'T IGNORE THE EGREGIOUS ASYMMETRY OF MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC POWER BETWEEN WELL ARMED ISRAELI FORCES AND THE
MEAGER DEFENSE OF PALESTINIANS. WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T CONTRIBUTE TO
RELENT LESS RACIST DEHUMANIZATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP.
>> ADAM, GO AHEAD.
>> HI MIT GRADUATE STUDENT AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY
ORDERS. I WAS CALLED A NAZI LAST WEEK. AND AS AN ISRAELI CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENT, I ASK YOU WHAT MESSAGE DOES THIS RESOLUTION SEND TO ME
AND MY FAMILY? WE CANNOT FORGET EVERY COIN HAS TWO SIDES. BEING
THE FIRST CITY TO CONDEMN ISRAELI IS NOT A BADGE OF HONOR, BUT A
MARK OF SHAME FOR BEING THE FIRST ONE TO SUCCUMB TO A UNILATERAL
VIEW. TO BOYCOTT IS TO CREATE BARRIERS TAKING US AWAY FROM PEACE.
CAMBRIDGE HAS SO MUCH TO OFFER TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE BOYCOTT. COLLABORATE TO BRING HEARTS
TOGETHER, NOT RIP THEM APART. PIONEERS OF HOPE AND NOT FIELD HATE.
DO IT BEST AND TACKLE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS TOGETHER. I CALL YOU TO
OBJECT THE POLICY ORDERS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IF YOUR HAND IS RAISED, WE WERE NOT GOING BY
HANDS, WE HAVE TO GO BY THE ORDER FOLKS HAVE SIGNED UP. NAOMI,
WHO WILL WORK WITH ME, WILL FIGURE OUT WHO HAD SIGNED ON EARLY
AND WASN'T IN THE ZOOM AND NOW IN THE ZOOM. WE'LL GET TO YOU IN
DUE TIME. GOING TO KRISTINA.
>> MAYOR, HARVEY IS BACK. CAN WE CALL ON HIM NEXT?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES.
>> HELLO. GOOD EVENING. I LIVE ON CENTER STREET. A LONG TERM
RESIDENT. AND I WANT TO STATE STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY
ORDER. IF FAILS BY SELECTING A BDS POLICY AGAINST COMPANIES THAT DO
WITH ISRAELI. AT THE CORE, THE FALSE EQUIVALENCE CRITICIZING ISRAEL IS


PAGE 19

May 24, 2021

NOT ANTISEMETIC. IT IS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS, THE POLICY ORDER
WILL FAIL THIS BASIC TEST. IT SEEMS ISRAELI IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL HUMAN
RIGHTS CHALLENGES. IT FAILS ME PERSONALLY, I HAVE FAMILY IN
PALESTINIAN. AND THE POLICY ORDER WILL MAKE ME FEEL UNWELCOMED
AND UNSAFE AS A RESIDENT. IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE SEEN
VIOLENCE IN THE U.S. CITIES, CAMBRIDGE DON'T IMPORT THIS VIOLENCE AND
HATE BY SUPPORTING PRO PALESTINIAN ACTIVIST AND THE BDS MOVEMENT.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK MARISSA IS BACK?
>> YES. A HEALTHCARE WORKER AND SERVING PEOPLE IN THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY. A DAUGHTER OF A DOMINICAN IMMIGRANT, I WANT TO SPEAK
ON THE CLEAR NECESSARY IMPERATIVE TO VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
THERE ARE NO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE UNILATERAL AND
INDISCRIMINATE TARGETING IS JUSTIFIED. CONTINUING TO DO BUSINESS
WITH COMPANIES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT ENABLE THE OPPRESSION OF
BIPOC PEOPLE, MAKES THE PEOPLE OF CAMBRIDGE COMPLICIT. AS A
HEALTHCARE WORKER WHO IS INFLUENCED BY DO NO HARM, THERE IS CLEAR
OF ONE ANSWER AND IT IS NOT COMPLICATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS JONAH NEXT? I THINK IT WAS CHRISTINA.
>> IT IS.
>> HI. THANK YOU. A DAUGHTER OF AN IMMIGRANT AND AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO OPPOSES TO APARTHEID AND RACISM, I'M HERE TO ASK THE COUNCIL
TO VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS. OTHERS HAVE SAID, HP ENTERPRISE IS
THAT FACILITATE THE MURDERS IN GAZA. AND I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT WILL
HELP FACILITATE DEPORTATION BY ICE. PLEASE SEVER THE CONTRACT.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO BEN NEXT.

>> I'M A JEWISH RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AND CURRENT FORMER
RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AND AN EMPLOYEE OF HARVARD. I'M HERE TO

I'M A FORMER RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE, ROW SIDING IN BROOKLINE. I'M
JEWISH. A MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER. CAMBRIDGE HAS BEEN AT THE
FOREFRONT OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE AND NOW IS THE
TIME TO STAND UP FOR PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. WHAT YOU WILL DO WILL
DETERMINE YOUR PLACE IN HISTORY. AND I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT YOU
HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE CRIMES OF HP ENTERPRISE
COMMITS IN PALESTINE AND IN THE UNITED STATES. I WILL IMPLORE YOU TO
RECOGNIZE THAT PALESTINIANS ARE HUMAN. THEY WANT AND DESERVE AS

PALESTINIAN REFUGEES. BORN IN CAMBRIDGE HOSPITAL AND GREW UP IN
CAMBRIDGE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THE POLICY ORDER PASSES.
CAMBRIDGE HAS A HISTORY OF STANDING UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
CAMBRIDGE STOOD UP AGAINST APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND IN COUNTRIES LIKE HAITI IN THE
1990S. TOOK A STAND AGAINST MIT COMPLICIT IN VIOLENCE AGAINST
YEMEN IN 2018.
HOW THINGS ARE PASSING ORDER 109 PEOPLE OF PALESTINE AND
INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.

>> AM I UNMUTED. SPEAKING AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109 AND
RESOLUTION 129. HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, WOULDN'T IT BE
WONDERFUL IF IT COULD BE ALL OUR FAULT, WE JEWS, WE AMERICANS, WE
CAN WAKE UP TOMORROW AND SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM. THAT IS NOT
THE STORY OF THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT AND NOT AN EFFECTIVE
WAY TO ENGAGE WITH IT FROM AFAR. PROPONENTS OF BOYCOTT
DEINVESTMENT AND SANCTIONS ARE MAKING THE ARGUMENT OF THE HARD
LINERS THAT ISRAEL MUST DEMONSTRATE STRENGTH AS IT HAS TO STAND
ALONE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND LEARN
IN THE CITY WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH ISRAEL. THERE ARE MANY. I HAVE
SEEN HOSTILITY TOWARD NO OTHER ETHNIC OR NATIONAL GROUP AS I HAVE
SEEN AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. THAT IS TO SAY MY PEOPLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO MATYA.
>> MAYOR, WE HAVE AIDEN FIRST.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I LIVE IN MID CAMBRIDGE AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST POLICY
ORDER 109 AND BDS. I HEARD FOLKS TALKING ABOUT HOW IS NOT
ANTISEMITIC. REGARDING POSTPONING THE COMMENTS, I APPRECIATE IT
WAS A HOLIDAY LAST WEEK... THIS IS ANTISEMITIC. TO SPELL IT OUT,
BECAUSE I'M A JEW, MY VOICE DIDN'T DESERVE TO BE HEARD IN THE CITY
WHERE I LIVE OVER A DECADE. THEY ARE FORBIDDEN TO USE ELECTRONICS


PAGE 21

May 24, 2021

DURING THE HOLIDAY... THE COUNCILLORS INCLINE TO VOTE FOR 109, THINK
ABOUT THE COMPANY YOU COMPANY IN SINGLING OUT THE JEWISH STATE
AND PEOPLE. AND VOTE AGAINST 109 AND KEEP CAMBRIDGE OPEN AND
ACCEPTING. AND I RECOMMEND CENSORING THE SAID COUNCILLOR. I
DIDN'T SEE IT UNTIL I SAW THE VIDEO OF LAST WEEK'S MEETING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MATYA.
>> HELLO. 13 YEAR RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. AND I MOVED TO THIS
COUNTRY AS A TEENAGER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT I
SUPPORT FOR THE ARABS IN THE REGION AND PARTICULARLY ARABS LIVING
IN ISRAEL, THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE ARABS ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. THE COUNTRY WHERE ARABS CAN PARTICIPATE
IN A FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY THAT IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE
FOR CAMBRIDGE TO PASS A BDS POLICY THAT PREVENT THEM FROM COMING
TO CAMBRIDGE AND BEING WELCOME TO SPEAK ON CAMPUSES AND OTHER
FORUMS HERE IN CAMBRIDGE JUST BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO BE CITIZENS
OF ISRAEL. I THINK BDS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND CALL YOU ON TO VOTE
AGAINST THE POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO CATHY.
>> CATHY HAS NOT JOINED.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I LIVED IN AND WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE AND PART
OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY FOR ABOUT THE LAST 14 YEARS. I HAVE LIVED
IN ISRAEL AND HAVE FAMILY THERE. I'M PROUD THAT OUR CITY
COUNCILLORS CONSIDERING POLICY ORDER 109. PLEASE PASS THIS
MEASURE. DO NOT ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT THAT CHALLENGING ISRAEL'S
RIGHT ABUSE IS ANTISEMITIC. THAT WOULD MEAN IT IS CORE TO JUDAISM.
PLEASE DO NOT ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT THAT STANDING UP FOR
PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS UNFAIRLY SINGLES OUT OF THE STATE. THAT
WOULD MEAN ALL OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS HAVE TO BE SOLVED
BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR OPPRESSED PEOPLE CAN SPEAK UP. AND DO NOT
ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT THAT THE SITUATION IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR
BDS. WE NEED THE CHANGE THAT BDS COULD BRING. PASS POLICY ORDER
114 FOR THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING FOR THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE GOING TO EVA?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD.
>> I LIVED AND WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR ABOUT 35 YEARS. AND LONG
BEFORE THAT, I WAS THE REFUGEE FROM NAZI EUROPE. I UNDERSTAND WHY
ISRAEL EXISTS, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ISRAEL DOES THAT I FIND
VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. APPARENTLY BECAUSE IT WANTS ALL THE
LAND AS POSSIBLE. AS THINGS STAND NOW, ISRAEL HAS TRADED ANY
SENSE OF TRUE JEWISH VALUES, JUSTICE FOR ALL, WHICH IS WHAT I LEARN
ED. TRADED THE BURDEN OF CONTROLLING OF OTHER PEOPLE AND A
REPUTATION AS A BULLY IN ITS CORNER OF THE WORLD. A BOYCOTT OF HP

>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HELLO. I'M BOTH A RESIDENT AND BUSINESS OWNER HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. THIS ORDER LIKE
MANY OTHER BSD INITIATIVES WILL FOCUS ON DELEGITIMIZING ISRAEL. IT
HAS BEEN REJECTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS BY IT WILL TURN THE REPUTATION OF CAMBRIDGE. SHOULD
IT PASS, MY HUSBAND AND I WILL CONSIDER MOVING OUT OF THE CITY AND
MOVING OUR BUSINESS TO NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANYTHING
CONNECTED TO OR SUPPORTING BDS. I'M A PROUD JEW, I WOULDN'T FEEL
SAFE IN THIS CITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, TOMAS?
>> HI. I LIVE IN BOSTON, BUT A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE FOR FOUR YEARS. I
COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER. THE PALESTINIAN JEW, WE
PRACTICE JUDAISM FOR YEARS. WE DIDN'T GO BACK WHEN ISRAEL WAS
ESTABLISHED. ANTISEMITISM WHEN ISRAEL BELIEVE THEY SPEAK FOR JEWISH
PEOPLE. THEY DON'T. NOBODY SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT
CAMBRIDGE CONTRACTS WITH AND PROFIT OFF OF THE BRUTAL MILITARY.
AND SPEAKING OF BRUTAL, LET US NOTE, THE COUNTRY POLICE FORCE IS
TRAINED WITH THE ISRAELI MILITARY. I WILL NOTE MY SUPPORT IN THE
POLICY ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE HEART PROGRAM TO TAKE AWAY ABOUT
EMERGENCY RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM THE POLICE. THANK YOU FOR THE
TIME TO SPEAK.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MICHAEL?
>> HI. LIVE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., I WAS A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE FOR
YEARS. I SPEAK FOR THREE CAPACITIES TODAY. ONE, A CURRENT FOREIGN
POLICY PROFESSIONAL. TWO, AS A JEW, AND THREE AS A FORMER RESIDENT.
ALL THREE ROLES I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109. FIRST, A
PROFESSIONAL, I WANT TO PUT TO REST THE TALKING POINT THAT THE
OPPRESSION IS TOO COMPLEX TO TAKE A STANCE. IT DOESN'T TAKE A PH.D.
TO RECOGNIZE AN APARTHEID. THE OPPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE SLANDER
IT. IT IS BECAUSE OF MY JUDAISM THAT I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE.
CAMBRIDGE HAS CERTAIN VALUES, THE LONG TERM GOALS ARE MORE THAN
EMPTY WORDS. CAMBRIDGE FUNDS ARE COMPLICIT IN APARTHEID. YOU
CAN'T STAY NEUTRAL ON THE MOVING TRAIN. WE DIG OUR HEELS IN THE
WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. HUBERT MURRAY?
>> 204 EERIE STREET. THE REMARKS ARE FROM MY TESTIMONY ON MAY 17,
IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER. READ INTO IS THE RECORD, THE WORDS
OF A PALESTINIAN, WHEN CORPORATIONS PROFIT FROM PROVIDING GOODS
OR SERVICES ENABLE ISRAEL TO REMAIN THE APARTHEID, THIS COMPLICIT
GENERATES AN ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CITIZENS TO ACT TO PREVENT
THE TAX MONEY AND THOSE WHO SPEAK IN THEIR NAME FROM BEING A

PARTNER IN ISRAEL'S RELENTLESS ATTEMPT TO TURN GAZA AND OTHER
GHETTOS INTO ZONES OF NONBEING.
TO SUGGEST THAT THE NORM OF VIOLENCE STRATEGY IS ANTISEMITIC IS DIS
A PROUD SON OF A LAWYER, I FIND IT PERSONALLY INSULTING. AS A
RESIDENT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. EDWARD.
>> YES, HELLO. I LIVE ACROSS THE BORDER IN WATERTOWN AND DO
POLITICAL ORGANIZING IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF
RESOLUTION 109. SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE POINT THAT THE...
BOYCOTTING HP IS A DODGE AND DIRECT ATTACK ON ISRAEL. IT IS NOT TRUE.
ALTHOUGH, CAMBRIDGE DOES DO A LOT OF BUSINESS INDIRECTLY WITH HP
THROUGH A SUBCONTRACT FOR WB MASON. AND THE ASSISTANT CITY
MANAGER FOR FINANCE, BOUGHT AT LEAST SEVERAL STOCK SEVERAL
BUILDINGS WITH PRINTERS FROM HP AS WELL AS PAPER FROM THEM AS
WELL. THEREFORE, PROVISIONS FOR COMPUTERS OR PRINTERS WILL NOT BE
PERMITTED AS PART OF THE TEXT WOULD ELIMINATE THOSE. WE KNOW
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. HADAR? (SILENCE)
>> HADAR HAS NOT JOINED. DAVID?
>> THANK YOU. I'M NOT A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, BUT I SPEAK IN SUPPORT
OF THE POLICY ORDERS. I WANT TO ADDRESS STATEMENTS THAT BOTH SIDES
ARE EQUALLY TO BLAME BECAUSE OF HAMAS. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE RACIST
SETTLER VIOLENCE. WE DON'T HAVE TO APPROVE OF SUCH TACTICS, BUT
RECOGNIZE WHY THEY HAPPEN. IN THE CASE OF THE PALESTINIAN
RESISTANCE, IT IS NOT SOME USE FORCE, BUT SO MANY HAVE CONTINUED TO
PUT THEIR FAITH IN THE NONVIOLENT TACTIC OF BDS, IN THE FACE OF SO
MUCH UNWILLINGNESS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO RESPOND
TO THE CALL. AVOIDING DIVISIVENESS AND POLARIZATION IS A LOUSY
PRINCIPLE. LET'S RESPOND TO PALESTINIAN CALLS FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE
BY PASSING THE POLICY ORDERS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ALINA?
>> GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ARE YOU THERE? (SILENCE) GO TO STEPHANIE. AND
BACK TO ALINA.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT. STEPHANIE IS NOT ON. DARAH, GO AHEAD. YOU
HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> I LIVE IN BOSTON. GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE AND HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR
THE CITY TO INVEST IN THE HEART PROGRAM. AND TO DIVEST FROM
COMPANIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HARMING PEOPLE IN PALESTINIAN. I SEE
THEM AS CONNECTED AND BLACK AND PALESTINIAN PEOPLE SHARE A
HISTORY OF OPPRESSION AND SOLIDARITY AND TWO EFFORTS THAT MOVE
TOWARD THE LIBERATION ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE HEART PROGRAM
PROPOSAL IS BORN FROM A COLLECTIVE, TRANSPARENT COMMUNITY BASED
PROCESS THAT IS INVOLVED ALL DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS, CONCRETE

May 24, 2021

REIMAGINE S WITHOUT OF THE INCARCERATION SYSTEM. THIS IS WHAT THE
HEART PROGRAM DOES AND IT DOES IT FROM THE BOTTOM UP. UNLIKE THE
PUBLIC SAFETY TASK FORCE, WHICH HAS NOT HAD A TRANSPARENT PROCESS.
WE HAVE TO ENSURE WE ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN THE OPPRESSION OF
PEOPLE WHO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND SELF DETERMINATION, THAT MEANS
NOT DOING BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES LIKE HP
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. YARDEN?
>> HELLO. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS STRONG
SUPPORT FOR POLICY ORDER S. I SPEAK AS A JEWISH CITIZEN OF THE STATE
OF ISRAEL. A STATE PREMISED ON WHITE SUPREMACY. THE ISRAELI
OCCUPATION FORCES RELY ON TECHNOLOGIES, BUILT IN PART BY HP, TO
POLICE PALESTINIANS. THAT IS WHY CAMBRIDGE MUST DIVEST FROM HP.
THE CITY MUST ALSO REVIEW ALL ITS OTHER CONTRACTS BECAUSE ALL
ISRAELI CRIMES ARE ENABLED BY THE UNITED STATES. THE UNITED STATES
HAS LONG SUPPORTED REGIMES THAT RESEMBLE ITSELF. AND UNITED
STATES CITIES POLICE ARE AN OCCUPYING FORCE THAT CRIMINALIZE AND
EXTRACT WEALTH FROM THE POOR AND THE NONWHITE. IT IS CRUCIAL TO
ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS THE HEART PROGRAM. PUT FORWARD BY THE
BLACK RESPONSE WITH COMMUNITY INPUT. THIS CITY MUST TAKE
RESOURCES AWAY FROM POLICE AND INVEST IN COMMUNITIES. PASS BOTH
THE POLICY ORDERS, THIS IS A STEP TOWARD DEMILITARIZING OUR CITY.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ALINA IS NEXT?
>> HI. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER. AND IN 2017, I VISITED
THE WEST BANK AND GOT A SENSE OF HOW LIVING AND OPPORTUNITY AND
BASIC FREEDOM OF MOVE. AND ONE WORD, PALESTINIANS LIVE A CHRONIC
TRAUMA UNDER OCCUPATION. THE GROUP OF STUDENTS IN GAZA WE MET
DESCRIBE IT AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST OPEN AIR PRISON. THE UNITED
STATES AND UK IT TOOK OVER 30 YEARS FOR DIVESTMENT FROM SOUTH
AFRICA TO BECOME MAINSTREAM AND EVENTUALLY IT DID. IN THEIR
WORDS, THEIR HOPE IS INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY, SIMILAR TO SOUTH
AFRICA. RECONCILIATION AND DIALOGUE CAME AFTER THE END OF THE
APARTHEID AND NOT BEFORE. END THE COMPLICIT AGAINST PALESTINIANS.
THANK YOU.
>> FARAH, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI, I WAS A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE FOR MORE THAN 25
YEARS. AND A FORMER PEACE COMMISSIONER. I RAISED MY CHILD THERE. I
WANT TO THANK THE CITY COUNCIL FOR ALLOWING ME TO EXPLAIN WHY I
THINK THAT I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF 109, TO BOYCOTT HP AND OTHER
COMPANIES THAT ANY COMPANY PRODUCTS THAT PROFIT ISRAELI
APARTHEID. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE PROGRESSIVE CITY
COUNCIL RESOLUTION TO STOP INVESTING IN COMPANIES THAT IN SOUTH
AFRICA. THAT'S WHY WE DEFEATED SOUTH AFRICA AND WE HAVE DO THAT
TO DEFEAT ISRAEL. AND THAT'S NOT ANTISEMITIC. FOR PEOPLE THAT CLAIM
THAT. AND WE WANT TO WE WANT THE BOYCOTT TO CONTINUE TO

CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY WHERE AN OLD PALESTINIAN WOMAN WITH
CANCER DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR LONG HOURS BEFORE GETTING
TREATMENT...
>> THANK YOU. NEXT, WE HAVE GABRIEL. GO AHEAD.
>> THANKS. I'M A MEXICAN STUDENT AT HARVARD. I'M SPEAKING TODAY TO
VOICE MY OPPOSITION TO POLICY ORDER 109. I HAVE BEEN PROUD TO LIVE
IN CAMBRIDGE. A CITY SPOKE THE TRUTH, WHETHER POPULAR OR NOT. I'M
APPALLED TO FOUND OUT CITY COUNCIL IS DEBATING THE RESOLUTION
ABSURD ON ITS FACE. TO CLAIM IT IS APARTHEID STATE IS A SLANDER. ISRAEL
PROTECTS EVERYBODY'S HUMAN RIGHTS REGARDLESS OF NATIONAL ORIGIN.
THE PROPOSAL WILL DISTORT THE CURRENT EVENTS. IT MENTIONS THE AIR
STRIKES WITHOUT MENTIONING THE REASONS. AND FINALLY, WHY IS ISRAELI
BEING SINGLED OUT. WHERE IS THE CALL TO BOYCOTT CHINA SLAVE
PRODUCTS. THE CALL FOR BOYCOTT TO HAMAS. DON'T LET CAMBRIDGE
BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH HATE AND MISINFORMATION. I URGE YOU TO
VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL AND STAND WITH
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TODAY. I LIVED AND WORKED IN
CAMBRIDGE FOR SIX YEARS. I WANT TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON POLICY
ORDERS. SEVER TIES WITH COMPANIES LIKE HP, WHICH SUPPLY
TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE COLLECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA USED TO SURVEIL,
INCARCERATE, AND TERRORIZE AND CLEANSE RACIALLY. CHURCHES AND
MOSQUES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED AS WELL AS RIGHT WING SETTLERS. THEY
ARE THE TOOLS OF OPPRESSION USED BY THE MILITARY IN THE UNITED
STATES AND ISRAEL. AS A HISTORIAN OF SCIENCE, I'M TROUBLED THAT OUR
TAXES ARE FUNDING TECHNOLOGIES OF RACIAL OPPRESSION HERE AND
ABROAD. I DEEPLY EMPATHIZE WITH ALL OF THE FOLKS HERE TODAY WHO
HAVE VOICED FEAR OF THEIR ADDRESSES BEING SHARED AND OF RACIAL
PROFILING. I WANT TO VOICE THIS IS NOT AN ANTISemitic MOVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. FOLLOWED BY NOOR?
>> HI. I LIVE ON BROOKLINE STREET. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES, DIVEST IN
COMPANIES LIKE HP AND OTHERS COMPLICIT. I LIKE TO REITERATE
SUPPORTING AND BACKING OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IS NOT ANTISemitic.
IT IS BEING WEAPONIZED TO AVOID CRITICISM OF ISRAEL. IT IS IMPORTANT
WE ARE ASKING TO SUPPORT STOP THE SUPPORT OF OPPRESSION. IF WE
CONTINUE BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH HP, WE VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS. I
WOULD LIKE TO THROW MY SUPPORT BEHIND 114, CAMBRIDGE IMPLEMENT
THE HEART PROGRAM THAT HAS ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE TEAM TO
POLICING. THE PLAY OF PALESTINIANS AND BLACK AMERICANS ARE ONE IN
THE SAME. THE SAME OPPRESSION AFFECT BROWN AND BLACK
COMMUNITIES HERE IN AMERICA. LET'S LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND PASS THE
POLICY ORDERS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP WE HAVE ASAF.
>> HI. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I LIVE WITH MY WIFE AND YOUNG KIDS AND

WORK HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS. I GREW UP IN
ISRAEL. GOING TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. ABOUT FRIENDS, SUICIDE
BOMBERS, ROCKETS FIRED AT MY FAMILY. BUT SINCE LAST MONTH, THERE
WERE HUNDREDS OF ATTACKS AGAINST JEWS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IN
A SINGLE WEEK. SINGLING OUT ISRAEL WILL LEAD TO MORE ATTACKS.
THAT'S SIMPLE. SINGLING OUT ISRAEL LEADS TO MORE ATTACKS ON JEWS.
WHY ARE YOU WHY THE CONFLICT HERE? WHERE IS THE CAUSE FOR OUR
SAFETY? WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE AND THE PROPOSALS ARE TO BLAME.
STOP SUPPORTING BDS, DROP THEM AND KEEP US SAFE FROM RACIAL AND
RELIGIOUS HATRED HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DAVID?
>> DAVID HAS NOT JOINED. MARILYN, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. I'M A STUDENT AT MIT. AND ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES
STATE DEPARTMENT, HOLDING ISRAEL TO A DOUBLE STANDARD IS LEGALLY
ANTISemitic. THE FACT THE CAMBRIDGE COUNCIL IS BOYCOTTING ISRAEL
AND NOT CONSIDERING BOYCOTTING CHINA IS ANTISemitic. MY GREAT
GRANDPARENTS ARE SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. THEY CAME TO THE
UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON THE
PRINCIPLES OF GIVING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTED GROUPS SAFETY HERE. THEY
WANT ME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PRIVILEGES LIKE GOING TO
MIT. HOW CAN I AND ALL OF US BE A PART OF THIS? WE KNOW HOW THE
STORY GOES. DON'T BE COMPLICIT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE DANIEL.
>> HELLO. GO AHEAD. PART OF THE CAMBRIDGE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
LIVING IN SOMERVILLE. SPEAKING AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER. I'M A SON
OF AN EGYPTIAN JEWISH REFUGEE. MY UNCLE BORN AND RACED IN EGYPT,
WAS HELD IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR THREE YEARS. PRISONERS
OTHER PRISONERS WERE TORTURED AND HUMILIATED. AFTER SURVIVING,
MY UNCLE ARRIVED AS A REFUGEE IN ISRAEL. AND LIKE MANY OTHERS
ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST, HAVE BUILT A NEW LIFE THERE. MY FAMILY'S
EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT IS WHAT INSPIRED ME TO SPEND TIME AS A DATA
ANALYST AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER 114 AND
AGAINST 109.
THE BDS MOVEMENT WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN RADICAL ANTIPEACE
ELEMENTS IN THE SOCIETY. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE POLICY ORDER 109.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LANA.
>> CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT ON COLUMBIA STREET FOR 14 YEARS AND I
SUPPORT THE ORDERS. YOU RECEIVED TESTIMONY THAT HP WILL PROVIDE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RACIST ENTITIES THAT TARGET PALESTINIANS,
BLACK, BROWN PEOPLE. IN THEIR TESTIMONY, THEY DON'T DENY THE RATE
OF SYSTEM ID CHECKPOINTS, THE BOMBING OF SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS,
THEY DON'T DENY THE INVOLVEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, OR IN THE
DEPORTATION OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THEY TALK TO THEIR RIGHT TO
WAR. WE SHOULDN'T DEFEND COMMUNITIES WHEN THEY STEAL OUR

WATER OR BOMB US. THEY FEEL UNSAFE WHEN PEOPLE ORGANIZE AGAINST
THEM. THIS IS WHITE SUPREMACIST BEHAVIOR. YOU CAN REMOVE MONEY
OUT OF RACIST INFRASTRUCTURE AND INTO COMMUNITY SAFETY THAT WILL
LIMIT THE REACH OF POLICE. THERE'S ONE QUESTION, WILL YOU SIDE WITH
WHITE SUPREMACY OR SIDE WITH US, VOTE YES ON 109 AND 114.

>> I'M APPALLED BY THE OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE. AND THE LOSS OF LIFE
OF ALL TOO MANY PALESTINIANS. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER
109. JEWISH TRADITION IN MY YEARS HAVE TAUGHT ME REAL CHANGE CAN
ONLY HAPPEN THROUGH ENGAGEMENT. THROUGH DIALOGUE AND
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. THE INJUSTICE AND THE HARM IT CAUSE, WE MUST
TAKE PART IN THE HEALING PROCESS. THE POLICY ORDER AS ALL BDS
INITIATIVES IS A DISENGAGEMENT STRATEGY. IT RUNS COUNTER TO PROVEN
EFFECTIVE ORGANIZING STRATEGIES AND LEGITIMIZE THE DOUBLE
STANDARD. WE HOLD NO OTHER NATION, BURNING BRIDGES IN
COMMUNITIES LIKE OUR, WHEN WE SHOULD BUILD THEM. AND MANY OF US
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANTISEMITISM AND OPPOSITION
OF ISRAEL ACTION, THERE ARE MANY WHO DON'T
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. JONATHAN.
>> HI, I MOVED TO CAMBRIDGE 25 YEARS AGO. AND LIVED IN WEST
CAMBRIDGE FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. I HAVE CO FOUNDED TWO
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN CAMBRIDGE. BOTH COMPANIES HAVE
OPERATIONS IN CAMBRIDGE AND IN ISRAEL. BOTH COMPANIES EMPLOY
JEWS, ARABS, CHRISTIANS. I SUPPORT THE RIGHT FOR ISRAEL TO EXIST AND
DEFEND THEMSELVES. I DON'T AGREE WITH ALL POLICIES OF ISRAEL,
CAMBRIDGE, OR PALESTINIANS. THIS BOYCOTT WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP
THE CAUSE. EVEN WORSE, IT WILL DISCOURAGE DIALOGUE AND PEACEFUL
RESOLUTION. IT WILL ONLY EMBOLDEN FORCES OF HATE ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE CONFLICT. IN ISRAEL, THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND HERE AT
HOME. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE CITY WHERE I LIVE, WORK, AND RAISE MY
CHILDREN, A CITY ADMIRED FOR THE CRITICAL THINKING, TAKE A COMPLEX
ISSUE AND BRACE A ONE SIDED IDEOLOGICAL SOLUTION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ALEX.
>> HELLO. I'M ALEX. I'M A RESEARCHER IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER
SCIENCE AT CARNEGIE MELON AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH FELLOW AT
HARVARD. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF BOTH POLICY ORDERS. BDS IS
A NONVIOLENT TACTIC TO APPLY PRESSURE TO UPHOLD INTERNATIONAL LAW
AND RESPECT PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY SUPPLY SERVICE TO THE
MILITARY, THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE SPECIFIC TO ENABLE REGIME OF
APARTHEID AND DISCRIMINATION IN ISRAELI PRISONS AND PALESTINE. THE
DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT THAT ISRAEL SUBJECTS THE PEOPLE TO IS NOT
POSSIBLE WITHOUT A WAY TO TRACK AND CATEGORIZE THEM, WHICH IS
WHAT HP 'S TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE THEM TO DO. IT WOULDN'T BE
SINGLING OUT ISRAEL TO CALL THIS OUT VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
OCCUR ELSEWHERE AND HP IS ESSENTIAL TO THEM. HP SOLD COMPUTER

SYSTEMS TO NSA AND ICE, WE NEED TO DIVEST FROM HP AND VOTE YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO SARAH.
>> HI. I'M A JUNIOR AT HARVARD COLLEGE. I SUPPORT PALESTINIAN HUMAN
RIGHTS AND ISRAEL HUMAN RIGHTS. THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU TO REJECT
POLICY ORDER 109 TO BOYCOTT HP. THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN LINKED TO
BDS, THE GOAL NOT TO CHANGE POLICIES, BUT BDS FOUNDERS HAVE
STATED THAT THE STATE CANNOT EXIST AT ALL. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE
CITY OF CAMBRIDGE WOULD REJECT THIS POLICY TO FURTHER THE
COMMITMENT TO UPHOLD GLOBAL JUSTICE AND THE HUMANITARIAN
RIGHTS OF ALL. IT IS ALSO NO WONDER THE PRESIDENT AND GOVERNORS OF
ALL 50 STATES REJECT BDS AND WHY CAMPAIGNS ARE LINK TO THE RISE IN
ANTISemitic ATTACKS. IF YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH HP, UNDERSTAND THAT
CAMBRIDGE HAS NO CONTRACT WITH HP. MAKING THIS WHOLE
RESOLUTION PREFORMATIVE. AND I URGE YOU TO REJECT THE POLICY
ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ERIK? HELLO. RIVER STREET AND A GRAD STUDENT AT
MIT. I WILL URGE YOU TO PASS BOTH POLICY ORDERS. I URGE YOU TO WANT
LOOK AWAY FROM THE UNACCEPTABLE POLICE MOB VIOLATION AGAINST
THE PALESTINIANS. I URGE YOU TO SEE WHAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
ORGANIZATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED, THE CONTINUING POLICIES OF
PALESTINIAN DIS I URGE YOU TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE THE FLARE UP IS THE
RACIST LAWS AND THE MILITARY OCCUPATION CONTINUE AS THEY HAVE
WITH DECADES.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
I IMPLORE YOU TO PASS POLICY ORDER 109 TO HOLD ISRAEL TO THE SAME
STANDARD THAT WE HAVE AIM TO HOLD SAUDI ARABIA AND SOUTH AFRICA.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SOPHIE?
>> HI. I LIVE ON PROSPECT STREET. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE THE CITY
COUNCIL TO SUPPORT BOTH POLICY ORDERS. LAST WEEK YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE 99% CONVICTION RATE IN THE ISRAELI MILITARY COURTS WHERE THEY
ARE TRIED. I WANT TO ADDRESS ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE ISRAELI PRISON
SYSTEM THAT SPEAKS TO THE INVALIDITY OF HAVING ANYTHING REMOTELY
TO DO WITH JUSTICE. THAT IS THE PRACTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE
DETENTION. THAT'S WHEN PRISONERS ARE HELD INDEFINITELY WITHOUT
OFFICIAL CHARGES OR TRIAL. I SAY INDEFINITE, IT CAN MEAN YEARS. THIS IS
A REGULAR PRACTICE IN THE ISRAELI PRISON SYSTEM. IT IS ILLEGAL UNDER
INTERNATIONAL LAW. OUT OF THE 4,400 PALESTINIANS IN PRISON, 430 ARE
IN ADMINISTRY DETENTION AND THE NUMBERS RISE DUE TO THE CURRENT
MASS IMPRISONMENT SCHEME GOING ON
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO MICHAEL.
>> HI. SO, I'M MICHAEL. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE PORT. JEWISH AMERICAN. I
HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN ISRAEL. SPENT TIME TRAVELLING TO THE
WEST BANK, PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE

I HAVE OBSERVED, THE OCCUPATION ACTIVITY, THEY APPEAR BY DESIGN TO
ENCOURAGE HOPELESSNESS, FRUSTRATION, AND RADICAL VIOLENCE BY
PALESTINIANS, OTHERWISE WOULD BE INNOCENT. THIS IS CRYSTALLIZING
THE DISTRUST TOWARDS ARABS AND JUSTIFYING THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY
MEASURES.

ACTIVELY ORGANIZING IN CAMBRIDGE AS COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO WHEELER
CAN ATTEST, IN 2019, AGAINST THE SUBSTATION ACROSS FROM AN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS. ONE,
WHILE WE CANNOT REDUCE ATTACKS TO STATISTICS, I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT,
MAJORITY OF ANTISemitic ATTACKS ARE CARRIED OUT BY FAR RIGHT WHITE
SUPREMACIST ACCORDING TO A REPORT. OVER THE LAST DECADES, THEY
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 10% OF EXTREMIST MURDERS IN THE
COUNTRY. THE ACTIVISTS IN CAMBRIDGE AND THE BOSTON AREA HAVE PUT
THEIR BODIES ON THE LINE WHEN THE THEY COME MARCHING INTO THE
BOSTON AREA AND I SUPPORT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO JOEL.
>> THANK YOU. HI, PROSPECT STREET. JEWISH CAMBRIDGE, GRANDSON TO
HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND TALK ABOUT PALESTINE HEART AND LIBERATION.
I BELIEVE IT IS SIMPLE TO STOP BUYING PRINTERS FROM A COMPANY THAT
WILL FACILITATE AN AMERICAN APPROVED OPEN AIR DEATH CAMP. THEY
OPPOSE THE ISRAELI ACTIONS AND REPRESENTING A SECULAR OUTPOST...
GIVEN THE PAST TWO WEEKS SAW THE HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, GAZA
BUILDING, AND MURDERED 65 CHILDREN, CONFLATING THE ISRAELI APART
TIED STATE WITH JEWISH IDENTITY IS AN ACT OF ANTISEMITISM. JEWISH
PEOPLE CAN LOOK TO HISTORY TO SEE THE USE IN SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS BY
AUTHORITARIAN REGIME OF WAR. IN PRESENT DAY, ISRAEL DEMOCRACY
DENIES THE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, VACCINE AND DIGNIFIED LIFE. THANK
YOU.

OF ARCHITECTURE WITH A FOCUS IN HISTORY, THEORY, AND CRITICISM. IT IS
WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE I GAINED FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AT MIT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON PO
109 AND 114. HISTORY WILL TEACH US THE EXPERIENCE OF JUSTICE AND
EQUITY LIES NOT ONLY AS A MORAL IMPERATIVE, BUT A PRACTICAL REALITY.
IF CAMBRIDGE IS TO REMAIN A GLOBAL LEADER IN ACADEMICS AND


PAGE 30

KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION, IT MUST DEMONSTRATE WILLINGNESS TO
DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE LEAST ABLE TO DEFEND
THEMSELVES.
CAMBRIDGE HAS A STORIED HISTORY FIGHTING INJUSTICE FROM APARTHEID
SOUTH AFRICA TO THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY AND MIT SUPPORT OF
STUDY VIOLENCE AGAINST YEMEN. I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE THIS
TRADITION AND UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS IN BOTH POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. BENJAMIN?
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ADJOURNING THE DISCUSSION. I HAVE A
CHANCE TO SPEAK, I LIVE AT 331 HARVARD STREET IN CAMBRIDGE. AND LET
ME SAY THAT I'M JEWISH, I'M PROUD TO BE JEWISH AND I'M PROUD TO BE A
MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHICH IS CENTRAL TO
MY LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE. THAT HAS NO RELEVANT TO THE FACTS. HUMAN
RIGHTS WATCH IS RELEASED A 200 PAGE REPORT DOCUMENTING THE ISRAELI
CRIMES OF APARTHEID. AND THE FACT IT WAS FOUNDED ON AN
INTENTIONAL VIOLENT AND SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN OF ETHNIC CLEANSING
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO THIS DAY.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE ISRAEL IS SO CENTRAL TO THE
AMERICAN IMPERIAL PROJECT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT THE TIDE IS
TURNING. WE KNOW FROM THE SOUTH AFRICAN EXAMPLE, THE ROLE OF
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS TO PLAY. I'M PROUD TO LIVE IN A
CITY THAT IS A TREND SETTER IN THAT FIGHT. AND I HOPE YOU WILL
CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS TODAY.

HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS, PROUD AMERICAN AND JEW. LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR
YEARS AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS. IT IS
REJECTED BY MANY POLITICIANS IN BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THEY SPREAD
FALSE PROPAGANDA AND DISREGARDS THAT ISRAEL IS THE ONLY DEMOCRACY
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ONLY COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT WILL
PROVIDE EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ
COMMUNITY. VALUES THAT OUR CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY HOLDS DEAR.
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN ANTISemitic ATTACKS THROUGHOUT THE

HAVING ONE STATE, JEWISH STATE, SINGLED OUT BY UPHOLDING BDS, YOU
ARE SAYING IT IS OKAY FOR JEWS AND ISRAELIS... TO FEEL UNSAFE. JUST AS
CAMBRIDGE CHOOSES TO DIVEST, MY FAMILIES AND FRIENDS, CHOOSE TO

AS AN AMERICAN YOUR AND A HISTORIAN OF AMERICAN JEWISH LIFE. ONE
BOOK IS ABOUT A MAN IN 1950 AND I TAKE ANTISEMITISM SERIOUSLY AS A
HISTORIAN AND JEW. JEWS IN THE UNITED STATES LIKE ME, HAVE JOINED
THE BDS MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT IS OUR DUTY. A
HISTORIAN, I KNOW THAT BOYCOTTS WORK. ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR
BOYCOTTS WAS A BO COT ORGANIZED BY JEWISH WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY.
IT WAS A SUCCESS. THEY WORK. I URGE YOU AND THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT
POLICY ORDER 109, IT IS A SMALL, BUT CONSEQUENTIAL WAY TO
DEMONSTRATE SOLIDARITY WITH THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST THE APARTHEID REGIME AND THEIR LIBERATION. THANK
YOU.

POPULATION. I HAVE COLLEAGUES STUDYING THE PH.D. WITH ME. ISRAEL IS
NOT AN APARTHEID STATE, FAR FROM IT. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE
PEOPLE OF GAZA. DOES YOUR HEART GO OUT TO MY PARENTS, MY BROTHER
WHO HAD TO FLEE THE HOUSE FROM ROCKETS LAST WEEK. YOU TAKE ONE

DISCRIMINATION. SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKE THIS SITUATION CLEAR, NOT
LEAST OF WHICH IS THE FACT THE MOST ROBUST VOICES AND
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOR BDS AND FOR THE RESOLUTION ARE JEWISH.
AND ISRAELI. I LOOK TO I LOOK TO MANY ISRAELI RESOURCES, I LOOK TO
JEWISH VOICE FOR PEACE, AS RESOURCES IN A CHORUS OF RESOURCES AND
VOICES THAT COMPRISE THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT. THE NUMBER OF
ANTIZIONIST IS NOT SMALL. IT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. PALESTINIANS ARE
NATIVE AMERICANS, ISRAEL IS A SETTLER COLONIAL PROJECT AND

>> MY SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER AND THE PALESTINIAN CHILDREN
AND FAMILIES ACT MUST NOT BE SEEN AS ANTISemitic AND SEEN AS A
REASONABLE EFFORT TO ENDORSE HUMAN RIGHTS BY HOLDING THE
GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AS WELL AS ANY AND ALL GOVERNMENTS AND
CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS WHERE THEY OCCUR.
MY OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID AND OCCUPATION, AS WELL AS HAMAS
ROCKETS, IT IS NOT ANTISemitic. OVER THE LAST 45 YEARS AS A RESIDENT,
WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES. ISRAEL IS NOT
SINGLED OUT. ALSO, I WANT TO URGE THE COUNCIL TO ENDORSE THE
VALUES CONTAINED IN THE HEART PROPOSAL AND PROVIDE FUNDING FOR
BROAD COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND HOW BEST TO MAKE THE
VALUES A REALITY. TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABLE AND THE VALUE IN
HUMAN RIGHTS ARE AT THE CORE OF MY AGENDA.

OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY ORDER. THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A BILL ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS SUPPORTED BY PROPONENTS OF THE BDS MOVEMENT,
IT IS TO THE END OF ISRAEL AS A JEWISH STATE. AS A PEOPLE JEW, LIKE ALL
PEOPLE, HAVE A RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION. TO ME, ANY MOVEMENT
SUCH AS BDS THAT WILL DENY THE RIGHT OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE TO SELF
DETERMINATION IS ANTISemitic. IT IS CRITICAL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
CRITICISMS OF ISRAEL POLICIES AND THE EXISTENCE AS A STATE. THE
FORMER IS OKAY, THE LATTER IS ANTISEMITISM. THE RESOLUTION FAILS ON
THIS FRONT DUE TO THE TIES TO THE BDS MOVEMENT. I URGE YOU TO
OPPOSE THIS MOTION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SHIREEN?
>> HI. CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. HERE TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS.
URGE YOU TO END BUSINESS TIES WITH HP UNTIL THE COMPANY STOPS
SUPPORTING THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, INSTITUTIONALIZED VIOLENCE.
LAST MONDAY, I SPOKE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES IN OCCUPIED EAST
JERUSALEM. AND I SPOKE ABOUT HOW THEY PROVIDE THE COMPUTERS FOR
THE ISRAELI MILITARY AND THEY SUPPORT THE APARTHEID SYSTEM BY
PROVIDING THE SERVERS TO MAINTAIN POPULATION REGISTERS AND

ENTRENCH THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT BASED ON IDENTITY. I WILL URGE YOU
TO THINK OF THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN GAZA. IT IS BESIEGED BY ISRAEL AND
SUFFERED UNDER THREE CAMPAIGNS. EACH ONE WORSE THAN THE BEFORE.
IT IS A POWER THAT UNLEASHES VIOLENCE AND PUNISHMENT AND
MURDEROUS IN GAZA. THE ACTION TO CUT TIES WITH
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. SARAH?
>> HI. I'M A STUDENT AT MIT. I THINK IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF
CAMBRIDGE WENT THROUGH THE COMPANY THAT SUPPORTS ORDERS AND
CONNECTED THROUGH AND RESEARCH THE SUPPLY CHAINS AND ANY
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT MAY BE INVOLVED. HOWEVER, WITH
PUBLIC REPORTS OUT THERE OF COMPANY THAT SUPPLY CHAINS HAVE
FORCED LABOR STORY, RIDICULOUS TO BRING HP AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS
TIGHT OF THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE POLICY
ORDER PURPOSE IS TO UNFAIRLY SINGLE OUT AND DEMONIZE ISRAEL.
ALIENATING SWATHS OF JEWISH POPULATIONS AND THREATENING THE
SAFETY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN ISRAEL, WHO ARE SAFE FROM
INCOMING ROCKETS FROM GAZA BECAUSE OF THE ISRAELI MILITARY.
INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR REAL CHANGE AND THOUGHT INTO WHAT
COMPANIES THE CITY WILL SUPPORT AND WISH TO BE CONNECTED TO. I
OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS AND IMPLORE YOU TO DO THE SAME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SARAH?
>> MIA, GO AHEAD.
>> HI. I'M MAIA. RESIDENT OF WATERTOWN. I SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF
POLICY ORDER 109. IN THE ROLE OF THE CO CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL
WORKING GROUP OF THE BOSTON DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST OF AMERICA. IT
REPRESENTS 3,200 MEMBERS ACROSS THE BOSTON AREA. MEMBERS ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONGOING ETHNIC CLEANSING OF PALESTINIANS,
THE DISPOSITION OF PALESTINIANS, THE ONGOING RACIST BY ISRAELI POLICE
AND SETTLERS AND THE BOMBARDMENT AND MURDER OF PALESTINIANS IN
GAZA. HP IS THE EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS TO THE
ISRAELI MILITARY. USING THE COMPUTERS, ISRAEL WILL CARRY OUT
VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIAN IN GAZA. THE ARMY MURDERED 58
PALESTINIAN CHILDREN LAST WEEK. ISRAELI MILITARY, WHICH HP SUPPLIES,
USES VIOLENCE AND THE THREAT TO ADVANCE THE EXPANSION OF ISRAELI'S
SETTLEMENTS FURTHER INTO THE WEST BANK AND JERUSALEM. I URGE TO
VOTE YES TO IDENTIFY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. GOING TO URSLUA?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? (ECHO IN THE BACKGROUND). I LIVE IN NEWTON.
URGING YOU TO REJECT 109. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE WHEN I FIRST MOVED
TO THE U.S. FROM EUROPE AND TWO SONS ARE ATTENDING SYNAGOGUE IN
CAMBRIDGE. I FEEL BLESSED WHEN I CAME TO THE COUNTRY THAT MY
CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE TO HIDE THEIR JEWISHNESS OUT OF FEAR AS THEY
WOULD IN EUROPE. THE BDS, HAS MEMBERS OF HAMAS AND OTHER
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE SWORN TO DESTROY ISRAEL AND KILL
JEWS IN GENERAL. IT IS NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT ANTI ISRAEL ATTACKS

May 24, 2021

LEAD TO ANTI JEWISH ATTACKS. MY HEART BREAKS AS I WITNESS THE ACTS
OF VIOLENCE, AND COME TO REALIZE THAT EVEN IN THE UNITED STATES, I
WILL HAVE TO TELL MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN NOT TO IDENTIFY
OPENLY AS JEWS. I URGE YOU TO KEEP CAMBRIDGE OPEN AND WELCOMING
TO ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE LARA?
>> HELLO. I'M LARA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. I'M TESTIFYING TO URGE YOU TO PASS POLICY
ORDER S. I'M A FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND A PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHER WITH
AFFILIATION AT THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, I WILL SPEAK ON MY
BEHALF. MY FATHER IS BORN IN JERUSALEM, BEFORE THE STATE IS CREATED.
WE DO HAVE THE DEED TO THE FAMILY'S HOUSE, WE ARE CHRISTIAN, NOT
JEWISH, WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO THE FAMILY HOME. IT IS
NOW OCCUPIED BY A JEWISH FAMILY. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
THE ONE SIDED LAWS OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL THAT PREVENT PALESTINIANS
FROM MOVING THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY. SEIZING THEIR PROPERTY
AND DEMOLISHING HOMES AND RESTRICTING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND
SUPPLIES. IT CREATES INEQUITY IN THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF PALESTINIANS.
WE MUST SPEAK OUT AGAINST ISRAELI COLONIALISM AND STAND IN
SUPPORT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. TABATHA?
>> GOOD EVENING. GRADUATE OF HARVARD AND A RESIDENT. I KNOW
WHAT RACISM LOOKS LIKE AS A BLACK WOMAN. I WILL MAKE FOUR POINTS.
PALESTINIAN CAN LIVE ON OR TOUCH 13% OF THE WEST BANK. LIKE LIVING
IN MASSACHUSETTS AND CONFINED TO MIDDLESEX AND ESSEX COUNTIES. IF
ANY OF US TOUCH THE FOOT IN BOSTON, WE'D BE ARRESTED AND SERVE
TIME. HP 'S IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY MAKES THIS APARTHEID POSSIBLE.
ON A HARVARD TRIP, ISRAELI SOLDIERS POINTED GUNS AT US AND SAID
JEWISH CLASSMATES CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET. WHEN I MENTION I
STUDIED AT HARVARD, PEOPLE SAY THE BOSTON T PARTY. NO TAXATION
WITHOUT REPRESENTATION THEY QUOTED. BDS IS REVIVING THIS LEGACY
AND IN THIS CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO STOP POLICE FROM RECEIVING
TRAINING IN ISRAEL. I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 114, LET US RETHINK PUBLIC
SAFETY. ALIGN ETHICS WITH OUR WALLETS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP.
>> HI. THANK YOU. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I WORK FOR THE AMERICAN
JEWISH NEW ENGLAND. I OPPOSE POLICY ORDER 109, SINGLE OUT ISRAEL,
THE WORLD'S ONLY JEWISH STATE. THE MOVEMENT DOES NOT
RECOMMEND A PATH FORWARD TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. IT IS CAST
BLAME AND (LOW AUDIO). IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR A PALESTINIAN
STATE LIVING SIDE BY SIDE WITH ISRAEL. IT FUELS RHETORIC WHICH IS
FLOURISHING DANGEROUSLY AROUND THE UNITED STATES AND THE GLOBE
RECENTLY. I HAVE BEEN PROUD TO LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE FOR MORE THAN A
DECADE. IT IS ONE SIDED SOLUTION DOESN'T ALLOW FOR PRODUCTIVE
DISCUSSION BETWEEN NEIGHBORS. IT WILL POLARIZE OUR COMMUNITY.

PAGE 35

May 24, 2021

PLEASE OPPOSE IT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY
THOUGHTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: VANESSA?
>> HI. THANKS FOR LETTING ME TO SPEAK AGAIN. I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT
OF POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE
TO THE COUNCIL, THERE'S A LOT SAID. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AND
IT IS QUITE RARE. WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECREASE AND REDUCE THE
COMPLICIT IN VIOLENCE, IN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION, IN BOTH PALESTINE,
WEST BANK, AND THE UNITED STATES. BOTH OF THE POLICY ORDERS ARE
CONNECTED IN THAT THEY EXPLICITLY TAKE AWAY OUR COMPLICITY IN
RACIST POLICIES. AND CAMBRIDGE WANTS TO STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE
AND RACISM. IT CAN DO SO BY SUPPORTING THE POLICIES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LAWRENCE?
>> YOU CAN HEAR ME? THANK YOU. I'M LAWRENCE. I LIVE ON
MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE. I WILL SPEAK AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109. IN
THIS INSTANCE, I FEEL THE DIVESTMENT IS INEFFECTIVE, IMPRACTICAL AND
UNFAIR. ISRAEL IS THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC ENTITY IN THE REGION. THEY
HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND STRONG TIES TO THE UNITED STATES. WE
ARE THEIR LARGEST DONOR COUNTRY. THERE ARE PARTIES WITHIN ISRAEL
ITSELF THAT DON'T WANT THE SITUATION TO GO SIDEWAYS. THEREFORE, AS
AMERICANS, WE HAVE MANY TOOLS ON HAND TO PROMOTE A TWO STATE
SOLUTION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. DON'T FORGET, WE HAVE BIDEN AND
BLINKEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. DIVESTMENT IS USELESS, ENGAGEMENT IS
THE WAY TO GO. DON'T GO WITH... DIVESTMENT. USE YOUR VOICE, YOUR
VOTE, AND YOUR REPRESENTATIVES TO PROMOTE THE PEACE AND JUSTICE
WE ALL WANT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MIKE?
>> HELLO. I'M FROM FRANKLIN STREET. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDERS. UNITED STATES CITIZENS, THE AREA WHERE THE AVERAGE
PERSON DOESN'T HAVE POWER, IT CAN SEEM DEMORALIZING MILITARY
BUDGETS, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS IN THE FEDERAL OFFICE, NOBODY
WILL PUSH BACK. WE ARE TOLD WE CAN'T HAVE HEALTHCARE BECAUSE IT IS
TOO EXPENSIVE. WE SEND BILLIONS TO ISRAEL TO BOMB PALESTINIAN
CIVILIANS. KILLING 248 IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS, DOZENS OF CHILDREN. WE
ARE A SMALL CITY, WE CAN'T COMBAT THE BIGGER PROBLEMS. POLICY
ORDER LIKE THIS ONE AGAINST HP WILL TURN IT IS A PLACE WHERE WE DO
HAVE POWER, AND WE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL CITY, BUT IN TIMES PAST, WE
CAN BE A LEADER AND OTHERS CAN FOLLOW AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TO USE HP PRODUCTS TO OPPRESS THE PEOPLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CALLA?
>> HI. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGEPORT AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY
ORDER. I FIRST WANT TO DISPEL THE NOTION THAT ONE HAS TO BE A
FOREIGN POLICY EXPERT OR SCHOLAR TO UNDERSTAND THAT ISRAEL AN
ILLEGAL APARTHEID STATE. I'M 16 AND IT IS TRUE TO ME AND IT SHOULD BE


PAGE 36

May 24, 2021

TO YOU. CAMBRIDGE, THE PROGRESSIVE CITY IN THE COUNTRY, HAS THE
DUTY TO TAKE ACTION TO END THE COMPLICIT LISTEN TO THE DEMANDS OF
PALESTINIANS ON THE GROUND WHO DEMAND BDS. CAMBRIDGE CAN SET
THE STAGE FOR A GLOBAL MOVEMENT, JUST LIKE OTHER LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS STOOD UP TO END THE SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE MARY.
>> I'M HERE ASKING YOU TO VOTE NO ON POLICY ORDERS. I HAVE BEEN A
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THE ORTHODOX JEWISH
CHAPLAIN. ISRAEL IS REGULARLY SINGLED OUT FOR CRITICISM, INCLUDING BY
GOVERNMENT BODIES, SUCH AS THIS COUNCIL. A WORLD FILLED WITH
REGIMES AND TERRORISM, THIS DOUBLE STANDARD WILL SEND THE
MESSAGE THAT JEWS SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS NOT
SURPRISINGLY WE HAVE SEEN MORE ATTACKS THIS WEEK. IF THE PROPOSALS
PASS, CAMBRIDGE WILL BECOME THE FIRST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES
WHERE GOVERNMENTAL ACTION WILL MAKE JEWS FEEL UNSAFE. IT RUNS
COUNTER TO CAMBRIDGE POLICY, PLEASE VOTE NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE GETZEL.
>> GETZEL, WE ASK YOU TO UPDATE YOUR ZOOM VERSION. WHEN YOU
REJOIN, JOIN YOUR HAND AND WE'LL CALL ON YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PETER IS NEXT? JOSHUA?
>> I'M HERE. PETER. OPPOSE TWO ITEMS BEFORE YOU DEALING WITH
ISRAEL. BOYCOTT OF DOING BUSINESS WITH ISRAEL. IT WOULD ATTEMPT TO
TIE THE LEGITIMATE ASPIRATIONS OF ARAB PALESTINIANS TO DELEGITIMIZE
ISRAEL. FOR OVER 70 YEARS, ATTEMPTS LIKE THIS HAVE CONSIGNED THE
PALESTINIANS INTO LIMBO, WHICH CANNOT END WITHOUT A LONG
OVERDUE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO EXIST WITHIN SECURE
BORDERS. WITH THE OTHER MEASURE, RESOLUTION 2590, TEXT FOR THAT
RESOLUTION IS NOT POSTED ON THE WEBSITE. ANY SUPPORT FOR THAT
RESOLUTION IS PREMATURE. VOTE NO ON THAT. I WANT TO THANK THE
COUNCIL FOR ACTING SO THAT MORE VOICES COULD BE HEARD ON THE
ISSUES. AND TO THANK THE ENTIRE COUNCIL FOR TAKING THE VOICES INTO
CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JOSHUA?
>> HI. JOSHUA. 18 YEAR CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT WITH MY WIFE AND
CHILDREN. I WORK HERE. AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. I
CAN'T GENERALLY SPEAK ELOQUENTLY, LET ALONE IN A MINUTE. IT WILL
LEAVE TIME FOR AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL. IT IS NOT A HISTORIC OR
ACCURATE ONE. I DO THINK THAT NONE OF US ARE VERSED ENOUGH TO
FULLY SUSPECTED THIS AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAMBRIDGE
SHOULD TACKLE. NATIONAL LEADERS AND GOVERNORS HAVE REJECTED BDS.
THE GOAL IS NOT PEACE, BUT WISHES TO WIPE THE STATE OF ISRAEL OFF THE
MAP. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE BEING SENT? ENGAGING IN PEACE TALKS AND
NEGOTIATIONS IS INEFFECTIVE AND PROPAGANDA, INCLUDING THROUGH


PAGE 37

May 24, 2021

GOVERNMENTS OPPRESSING OTHER PEOPLE, PROVOKING
DISPROPORTIONATE RESPONSES. IT CALLS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS AND
IGNORES ROCKETS. LET'S FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT BOTH
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. EARNEST?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I LIVE AT WALDEN STREET.
AND I'M SHARING MY THOUGHTS ON POLICY ORDER SIX. IN SUPPORT OF
POLICY ORDER SIX. JEWISH AMERICAN, I SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF
CONGREGATIONAL LEARNING IN NEWTON. I DON'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
SYNAGOGUE, BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL IN CAMBRIDGE. LAST WEEK I BROKE MY
RELIGIOUS OBLIGATION TO SPEAK ABOUT THE POLICY ORDER. I MADE THAT
CHOICE WITH ALL THE PALESTINIANS IN MIND. AS CELEBRATIONS WERE
CANCELLED. AND I MADE THIS CHOICE TO ENSURE YOU DON'T CONFLATE
ANTIZIONISM. BOYCOTTING HP IS ONE STEP TO DIVEST FROM OPPRESSIVE
STATE VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL PALESTINE AND WITHIN OUR COUNTRY. I EXPRESS
MY SUPPORT FOR POLICY ORDER 114, I WITNESSED EXCESSIVE POLICE FORCE,
USE OF FORCE ON MY STREET IN CAMBRIDGE, I FILED COMPLAINTS AND
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. YANIV?
>> HI. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. MY CHILDREN ATTEND THE PUBLIC
SCHOOLS AND A RESEARCHER AT MIT. I'M THE SON OF JEWISH REFUGEES. I
STRONGLY OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER, BASED ON BIGOTRY, FALSE
ACCUSATIONS, LIES. AND GOING AFTER ONE PARTICULAR COMPANY AND
INTIMIDATING OTHERS EXAMPLES ORGANIZED CRIME PRACTICE. CAMBRIDGE
IS HOME TO MANY COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS IN ISRAEL. WHO IS NEXT?
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND A SLIPPERY SLOPE. IT WILL DRY
THE SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL REPUTATION OF CAMBRIDGE. THE SENSE OF
SAFETY MY COMMUNITY AND FAMILY HAVE IN THE CITY. THE VIOLENCE
AGAINST JEWS WILL PLACE ANTISEMITES ON THE SAME SIDE. I URGE YOU TO
REJECT THE POLICY ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE (UNKNOWN NAME) WHO IS BACK.
>> THANK YOU. I'M A HARVARD CHAPLAIN, CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND
RABBI AT HARVARD. IT IS MY JOB TO CARE FOR THE EMOTIONAL AND
SPIRITUAL LIFE FOR THE STUDENTS IN THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY. I'M A
RESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS HERE. I SPEAK AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER,
ANTIISRAELI LEGISLATION LIKE THIS TRIGGER JEWISH HISTORICAL TRAUMA.
WITHOUT MAKING A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE CONFLICT OF BRINGING
US CLOSER TO PEACE. I MEET WITH JEWISH FAMILIES EACH YEAR, WHO ARE
CONSIDERING MOVING TO CAMBRIDGE OR SENDING CHILDREN TO HARVARD.
OVER AND OVER, I'M ASKED IS CAMBRIDGE A SAFE PLACE TO BE A JEW. I
ANSWER BY TELLING THEM THAT NEITHER HARVARD OR CAMBRIDGE HAVE
PASSED A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS ONE.
I SUSPECT THAT MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF ISRAEL IS RECEIVED BY MANY JEWISH AS
VIOLENT. PASSING A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS WILL SEND A STRONG AND
UNINTENTIONAL MESSAGE THAT CAMBRIDGE IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE

PAGE 38

AND EXPRESS THE IDENTITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CHARLOTTE?
>> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT. I WAS
BORN AND RAISED IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M A TEACHER HERE AND INCOMING
STUDENT AT HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT POLICY
ORDER 109 TO END CONTRACTS WITH HP FOR THE ROLE IN UPHOLDING THE
APART TIED STATE AND FOR THE TECHNOLOGY USED TO TRACK IMMIGRANTS.
I WILL URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER 114 AND IMPLEMENT THE
HEART PROGRAM. TWO POLICY ORDERS ARE ON THE TABLE CONNECTED TO
UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND WITHDRAWING FUNDS FROM OPPRESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS AND SYSTEMS. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ME, AS A EDUCATOR IN
THE CITY, CAMBRIDGE STANDS ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE AND CONTINUE TO
SET PRECEDENCE IN LEADERSHIP FOR LIBERATION IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND
ENSURE THE CITY'S INVESTMENT AND PRACTICES ARE IN LINE WITH THE
ESTABLISHED VALUES. I URGE YOU TO END CONTRACTS WITH HP AND
IMPLEMENT THE HEART PROGRAM. SUPPORT 109 AND 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JOSEPH.
>> HELLO. I'M A GRADUATE STUDENT AT MIT. I URGE YOU TO REJECT POLICY
ORDER 109. BOYCOTT ISRAEL HAS NO POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR ISRAELI OR
PALESTINIANS. THE EFFECT OF SUPPORTING THIS IS INCREASED HATRED AND
FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY. THE CONFLICT IS COMPLEX. YOU SHOULD BE
SUSPICIOUS OF ANYONE SHUTTING DOWN EDUCATED DIALOGUE. PLACING
ALL THE BLAME ON ONE SIDE OF A COMPLEX CONFLICT DOESN'T BRING
PEACE. ONLY DEMONIZATION. TO CAST IT AS COLONIALISM IS AN OLD VIRUS
OF HATRED. STAND AGAINST HATRED AND REJECT THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE'LL GO TO TALIA.
>> THANK YOU. I HAVE BEEN A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS AND
I LIVE ON HARVARD STREET. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. THE FACT THIS
RESOLUTION IS ONLY CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT OF ONE COMPANY AND ONE
COUNTRY WITHOUT AN EXISTING CONTRACT OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ALL
CONTRACTS, IT LEADS ME TO WONDER WHY THE COUNCIL IS GOING OUT OF
THE WAY TO TARGET ISRAEL. THE WORLD'S ONLY JEWISH COUNTRY.
ANTISEMITISM IS RIDING AND IT DISTURBS ME THAT YOU CONTRIBUTE TO
THIS TREND. AND TELLS JEWISH AND ISRAELI RESIDENT WE ARE NOT
WANTED. I THINK THAT IS SHAMEFUL BECAUSE CAMBRIDGE IS KNOWN FOR
THE COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL EQUALITY, BUT TELL ALIENATE THE JEWS THAT
COME TO CAMBRIDGE FOR WORLD CLASS INSTITUTION AND TECH SECTOR. I
WOULD BE SCARED AND ASHAMED TO LIVE IN A CITY WITH LEADERSHIP THAT
IS SO MISGUIDED AND SO BIGOTED IT WOULD CONSIDER PASSING THIS
POLICY ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ROBERT?
>> THANK YOU. I'M SPEAKING IN MY CAPACITY AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE
AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE NEW ENGLAND OFFICE. IT IS A GLOBAL
ORGANIZATION WITH A LONG HISTORY OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS


PAGE 39

May 24, 2021

ADVOCACY. WE WELCOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT STRATEGIES TO ADVANCE
HUMAN RIGHTS. POLICY ORDER 109 DOESN'T DO THIS. IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO
LEVERAGE THE COUNCIL TO ADVANCE POLITICAL AGENDA, DEMONIZATION
AND DESTRUCTION OVER THE WORD'S ONLY JEWISH STATE. THIS IS THE
AGENDA OF THOSE WHO REJECT COMPROMISE AND CO EXISTENCE. HARDLY
PLACE FOR THE COUNCIL FOR A DIVERSE CITY. RATHER THAN FOCUS ON HP,
DOESN'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH CAMBRIDGE, THE COUNCIL COMMITTED
TO ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS MAY LOOK AT COMPANIES. IF YOU DO THIS,
YOU WILL FIND AN ORGANIZATION RIGHT HERE IN CAMBRIDGE THAT
PROVIDE PRODUCTS ON YOUR POCKETS, DESKS, AND THANK YOU WHO
ACTED LAST WEEK TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT OF MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH
COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MICHAEL?
>> MICHAEL HAS NOT JOINED. NANCY, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> I LIVED AT 938 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE FOR 23 YEARS. I UNDERSTAND
THE DEEP FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR ISRAEL. I GREW UP IN A JEWISH
HOME WHICH SUPPORTED ISRAEL 100%. I SPENT THE SUMMER OF 69 WITH
RELATIVES, I TRAVELLED TO ISRAEL. MY SUPPORT IS UNQUESTIONING. I
KNEW NOTHING OF THE PALESTINIANS. ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, I HEARD AN
NPR PIECE THAT SPOKE ABOUT ALL, CENTURIES OLD, THIS IS A GUT PUNCH.
IN 2014, I WENT TO A DELEGATION TO PALESTINE, I SAW IT WITH MY EYES
THE POOR TREATMENT OF WEST BANK PALESTINIANS BY ISRAEL. AND I'M
NOT TALKING ABOUT EVENTS. SUCH AS THE BOMBINGS IN GAZA. BDS IS ONE
PEACEFUL MEANS OF PROTEST THAT THE PALESTINIANS HAVE. AS A JEWISH
AMERICAN, I MOST STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SARA?
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SARA?
>> ROBERT, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> I'M HERE IN MY CAPACITY AS DIRECTOR OF ADL NEW ENGLAND. I
APPRECIATE THE RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION LAST WEEK, WHICH ALLOWS
ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY ORDER. ACCORDING TO
THE CITY MANAGER, CAMBRIDGE HAS NOT HAD A CONTRACT WITH HP SINCE
2014. MAKING THE RESOLUTION NEEDLESS AND CALLING ITS PURPOSE INTO
QUESTION. THE ORDER SINGLES OUT ISRAEL, FAILING TO ADDRESS OTHER
COUNTRIES. PASSAGE OF THE ORDER IS EQUAL TO CAMBRIDGE ENDORSING A
MOVEMENT TO DELEGITIMIZE THE RIGHT TO EXIST AND SEW DIVISION
AMONG THE RESIDENTS. TARGETING ISRAEL AS THE FOCUS OF THE INQUIRY,
THE POLICY ORDER TAKES US ONE STEP FURTHER AWAY FROM A PATH
FORWARD THAT WOULD PROVIDE BOTH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS WITH
SECURITY, SELF DETERMINATION, AND DIGNITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ASAF.

>> GOOD EVENING. I'M FROM MARLBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS. AND I
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IF THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE DOES DECIDE TO
BOYCOTT ONE ISRAELI PRODUCT, IT SHOULD BOYCOTT ALL OF THE ISRAELI
PRODUCT. OTHERWISE, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU JUST PICKING THINGS THAT ARE
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU AND WON'T HURT YOU. IF YOU WANT TO BOYCOTT
ISRAEL, BOYCOTT CELL PHONES, ANY OTHER PRODUCTS AFFILIATED OR
DEVELOPED IN ISRAEL. OTHERWISE IT IS HYPOCRISY. IF YOU BOYCOTT ONE
THING, I REALLY DON'T SEE THE POINT. YOU GO ALL THE WAY OR DO
NOTHING. THANK YOU.

REMIND ALL IN ATTENDANCE TOMORROW MARKS A YEAR SINCE GEORGE
FLOYD PROCLAIMS HE COULDN'T BREATHE AS POLICE OFFICER KNEELED ON
HIS NECK.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
NO SURPRISE GIVEN MANY POLICE FORCES, BOSTON AND CAMBRIDGE, HAVE
TRAINING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ISRAELI OCCUPATION FORCES AND GIVEN
HOW INTERTWINED THE STRUGGLES ARE AND HAVE BEEN. I BELIEVE IN THE
COMMUNITY AND THE PROPENSITY TO STAND FOR WHAT IS MORALLY RIGHT.
I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDER TO DIVEST FROM HP.
SUPPORTS THE REGIME IN VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS. I URGE YOU
TO REJECT MILITARIZED TACTICS IN OUR COMMUNITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS YAEL?
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM YAEL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO TO THE NEXT PERSON.
>> I BELIEVE ROSALINE?
>> YES. I'M A PHYSICIAN IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 37 YEARS. I LIVE IN NEWTON. I
STAND AGAINST BDS IN RESOLUTION 109 BECAUSE IT WILL DEMONIZE ISRAEL.
ISRAEL CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TO SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, LIVES ARE SAVED
BY ISRAELI ADVANCES, SUCH AS THERAPY FOR LYMPHOMA, IF ANY CITY
STANDS TO BENEFIT FROM COLLABORATION WITH ISRAEL'S GREAT MIND IS
CAMBRIDGE THE HOLOCAUST STARTED WITH BDS IN GERMANY, DEMONIZES
THE JEWS IN EUROPE. WITNESS THE ATTACKS IN L.A. AND NEW YORK. BDS
WILL PROMOTE TERRORISM, MY PATIENT WAS MURDERED IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBINGS. HAMAS LAUNCHED 4,000 ROCKETS AND YOU WANT
TO SANCTION ISRAEL. NO CALL FOR BDS AGAINST SYRIA WHEN THEY
MURDERED HALF A MUSCLE CIVILIANS. THE ANSWER IS NEGOTIATION.
THANK YOU.

FOR 12 YEARS AND BORN IN SOUTHWEST ASIA AND I GROUP AND LIVED WITH
REFUGEES. I HAVE BEEN TO ISRAEL, IT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY, BUT
SUPPORTED BY OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE
SURVIVOR, WHO IS NEARLY MURDERED BY BRITISH COLONIZERS AND EMPTY
OFFICERS, I FEEL SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINIANS AND BLACK AND BROWN
PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES. I'M PROUD OF THE ACTIVISTS AND CITY
COUNCILLORS WHO DESPITE THREATS OF VIOLENCE, STILL HAVE THE
COURAGE TO STAND FOR JUSTICE, JUST AS THE PREDECESSORS DID AGAINST
THE SOUTH AFRICAN APART TIED. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS FAILED. BY
SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTIONS, WE CAN HELP, LIKE THE UNITED STATES AND
ISRAEL THAT PROFIT FROM THE DEHUMANIZATION AND INCARCERATION OF
PALESTINIANS AND BLACK AND BROWN AMERICANS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU SAID STEVEN ALREADY WENT?
>> I'M SORRY. I BELIEVE THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WITH THE SAME LAST
NAME. WE CAN CALL HIM NOW.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: STEVEN?
>> HELLO. I'M STEVEN. 14 RICHARD AVENUE. I'M HERE TO SPEAK AGAINST
109. WHY IS ISRAEL SINGLED OUT? WHAT ABOUT CHINA. AMERICAN
COMPANIES BENEFIT FROM PRODUCTS MADE HERE. ISRAEL IS NOT PERFECT,
BUT HAS A RIGHT TO LIVE IN PEACE WITHOUT 4,000 ROCKETS FALLING IN
ISRAEL. THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ARAB, MUSLIMS, AND
CHRISTIAN ISRAELIS ARE DOCTORS, NURSES, PROFESSORS, UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS, AND HAS FULL RIGHTS AS CITIZENS. JEWS IN ARAB COUNTRIES
WERE ALWAYS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. ESTABLISH A PALESTINIAN STATE
HAVE BEEN REFUSED. I ASKED AN ARAB DOCTOR, WHY DID THEY TURN
DOWN THE CAMP DAVID AGREE. THE ANSWER WAS, ARAFAT AND THE
CRONIES LIVE A GOOD LIFE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE HAVE GAL?
>> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'M A RESIDENT OF
CAMBRIDGE. I GRADUATED MY MASTER'S IN THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
FROM TUFTS UNIVERSITY. I WILL PURSUE THE MASTER'S OF LAW FROM
COLUMBIA. I'M OPPOSING FOR THE PROPOSITION 109 AND URGE YOU TO DO
THE SAME. I LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR 29 YEARS AND SEEN THIS CONFLICT FIRST
HAND. I WATCH WHEN A SUICIDE BOMBER EXPLODED IN THE MIDDLE OF A
CIVILIAN CROWD, A FEW FEET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER AND BROTHER. A
KNOWN TERROR ORGANIZATION IN THE GAZA STRIP. INSTEAD OF BUILDING
HOSPITALS, HAMAS IS USING THEM AS A FRONT TO PROTECT THE ROCKET.
INSTEAD OF EDUCATING CHILDREN, IT IS TEACHING THEM TO HATE, MORE
RECENTLY, CONCLUDED BY THE REPORT. IF IS AIMED TO STOP HUMAN
RIGHTS ABUSE, YOUR EFFORTS ARE MISPLACED. IT IS ONLY SERVED HAMAS
PURPOSE TO CREATE MORE HATE TOWARD ISRAEL
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE HAVE DAVID.

ANTISEMITISM. IT WILL BE IMPORTING IT HERE. THIS ORDER IS NOT ABOUT

ISRAEL. IT IS ABOUT CAMBRIDGE. AND WHEN DECIDING, DO IT WITH US, THE
RESIDENTS IN MIND. I IMPLORE YOU, DON'T LET CAMBRIDGE BE USED AS A
TOOL ON THIS HATE BY SHOWING DOUBLE STANDARD TO THE ONE AND ONLY
JEWISH STATE IN THE WORLD. I WILL NO LONGER FEEL SAFE TO REMAIN A
RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. MY HOME FOR EIGHT YEARS. THANK YOU FOR
LISTENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO REFAEL NEXT.
>> HELLO. I LIVE IN MASS AVENUE IN CAMBRIDGE. I OWN A BUSINESS HERE
FOR SIX YEARS. I'M AN IMMIGRANT AND MY HUSBAND AND I ARE THINKING
ABOUT EXPANDING OUR FAMILY. THIS RESOLUTION WILL CONTINUE TO
LEGITIMIZE THE ANTISemitic ATTACKS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW
WEEKS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IT WILL MAKE US FEEL UNSAFE TO STAY
IN CAMBRIDGE AND FORCE TO SELL OUR HOME AND LIVE TO A MORE
INCLUSIVE CITY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ADRIANNE.
>> HI. RESIDENT OF TWO WARE STREET. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDER. I'M HERE TODAY TO ADVOCATE FOR THE INVESTMENT AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAMBRIDGE HEART PROGRAM, OUTLINED IN
POLICY ORDER. I'M CONFIDENT IN THE ORGANIZERS AND ENTHUSED BY THE
COMMUNITY ENGAGED PROCESS IMPLEMENTED TO COME UP WITH THE
HEART PROGRAM AS A COMMUNITY BASED EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVE TO
POLICING SYSTEMS TO BEST SYSTEM MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
I'M HEARTENED BY THE TESTIMONY TONIGHT THAT EMBRACE SOLIDARITY
BETWEEN THE BLACK AND PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT. BRINGING THE
INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTUAL PRACTICE IN LINE WITH THE ESTABLISHED
HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES MATTERS BECAUSE IT IS A CONCRETE STEP WE CAN
MAKE TOGETHER TO END THE OUTRIGHT VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIANS
WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE DIGNITY OF LIFE MANY OF US ENJOY HERE.
THE HEART PROGRAM IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS RECOGNIZING THE
HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL THOSE WHO ARE MARGINALIZED. THEY SHOULD BE
SUPPORTED.

>> HI, I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 25 YEARS. TEACH AT HARVARD EXTENSION
SCHOOL. A WRITER AND A SOCCER COACH AND A MOTHER OF FOUR
CHILDREN WHO WENT TO SCHOOL IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK
THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER. THE FACTS ARE, THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE PARTICIPATES FROM HP USING OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. FIRST,
ISRAEL IS CARRYING OUT VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIAN IN GAZA USING HP
COMPUTERS. THEY HAVE ALLOWED ICE INTO EXPEDITE OF TRACKING AND
DETAINING AND DEPORTING IMMIGRANTS. SEPARATING PARENTS FROM
CHILDREN DOMESTICALLY. AND THEY SPEARHEADED THE TECHNOLOGY TO
TRACK PRISON DATA. AS A CITIZEN, I LOOK FOR YOU TO TAKE
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ACTION BY ROLE MODELLING HUMAN AND CIVIL

>> GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HELLO. I WANT TO SPEAK ON A COUPLE OF POINTS. I BELIEVE, I CONFUSE
MYSELF, MEMBER OF SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M SPEAKING IN
SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER. I BELIEVE THAT BOYCOTTS ARE POWERFUL
TOOL. I THINK THEY NEED TO BE COUPLED WITH POLITICAL TOOLS. I THINK
WE NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN A BOYCOTT OR DIVESTMENT FROM HP. I
THINK WE NEED IS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, DIFFERENT
ALTERNATIVE TO THE JOE BIDENS OF THE WORD WHO WILL SAY NICE THINGS
ABOUT PALESTINE ONE DAY AND AUTHORIZE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
FUNDING THE NEXT DAY. I WANT TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE
NATIONAL BDS MOVEMENT. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I DO NOT
SUPPORT THE liquidation OF ISRAEL. IT IS WORKING CLASS THAT SUPPORT
THE COUNTRIES AND THAT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. RACHEL?
>> RACHEL, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> I URGE YOU TO LOOK AT ACTION AND NOT WORDS. BDS IS A PROXY
CAUSE AND SINGLES OUT THE JEWISH STATE. LOOK AT THE OPPRESSION IN
OTHER COUNTRIES AND PROPAGATED BY CHINA IRAN, AND RUSSIA. ONLY
ISRAEL IS SINGLED OUT AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOT. THEY ARE NOT
GIVEN THE SAME ATTENTION. IT IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. IT SHOULD BE
DEALT WITH BY PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE MATTER, TERRITORIAL DISPUTE.
BDS IS A DISGUISE. IT IS NOT SPEAKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT IS ONLY
AGGRAVATING IT. IF YOU LOOK AT ACTIONS, WHAT IS HAPPENING AT BDS
RALLIES, JEWS ARE BEATEN IN THE STREET. IT IS NOT ABOUT ISRAEL. IT IS
ABOUT JEWS. BDS IS ANTISemitic AND I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THE
RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: STEVE. ARE YOU THERE?
>> ONE SECOND. STEVE HAS NOT JOINED THE ZOOM. I'M LOOKING FOR THE
NEXT PERSON. ALLISON, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> I'M ALLISON. GRADUATE OF BOTH MIT AND HARVARD AND WORKED AT
THE MEDIA LAB AT MIT. I LIVE BLOCKS FROM CAMBRIDGE AND FREQUENT
CAMBRIDGE DAILY. I ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO AND OPPOSE THE POLICY
ORDER, RESOLUTION THAT SEEKS TO DIVIDE OUR COMMUNITY AND SO
HATRED. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR MEMBERS
OF THE COMMUNITY AND OUR PARTNERS TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS.
RESOLUTION 109 SINGLES OUT ISRAEL AND SEEKS TO DELEGITIMIZE THE
RIGHT TO EXIST. CAMBRIDGE VALUES DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND ISRAEL IS
THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. OFFERING FULL RIGHTS TO ITS
ARAB CITIZENS, LGBTQ COMMUNITY, WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR, IF YOU
CHOOSE TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER, YOU FUEL JEWISH HATRED AND
MAKE JEWS AND ISRAELIS FEEL UNSAFE IN THE CITY. THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE
STANDS FOR FAIRNESS, BUT THIS RESOLUTION IS FILLED WITH LIES AND SEEKS

THAT YOU PARTNER WITH BDS, FULLY REJECTED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN,
GOVERNORS FROM 50 STATES, MANY MORE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANNUM, YOU ARE NEXT.
>> HELLO. I'M A WIFE, I'M A MOTHER, AND I'M A LAWYER. I DO PLAN ON
JOINING BDS BECAUSE IT IS NOT BASED ON HATE, BUT RATHER AN ECONOMIC
MOVEMENT TO SANCTION ISRAEL BASED ON CRIMES AGAINST PALESTINIANS
AND THAT IS WHY I'M FOR 109 AND 114. AND I STRONGLY URGE THE
COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THIS. YOU KNOW, WHAT IS GOING ON IN PALESTINE
RIGHT NOW IS HORRIFIC. 48 CHILDREN GOING ON I THINK 56 JUST FROM
YESTERDAY. THEY HAVE BEEN MURDERED. THIS IS NOT A COMPLEX ISSUE.
ISRAEL IS APARTHEID STATE. IT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. NOT JEWISH OR
MUSLIM ISSUE. WE NEED TO NOT BE COMPLICIT IN THE CRIMES. THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME. PLEASE SUPPORT 109 AND 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SUZANNE?
>> THEY HAVE NOT JOINED. GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. 22 HARRIS STREET. AND LIKE TO ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON
THE POLICY ORDERS. I SEE THE TWO AS LINKED. I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT
ENDING PURCHASING OF HP IS URGENT. THE IF YOU HAVE PRINTERS, THE
CARTRIDGES WILL SUPPORT A COMPANY THAT DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO
THE DISCRIMINATION OF PALESTINIANS FROM THE HOME AND ALLOWS THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO TERRORIZE IMMIGRANTS. THE HARMS ARE
ONGOING AND OCCUR AS WE SPEAK. AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD
INVEST IN COMMUNITY LED EFFORTS THAT REDUCE HARMS FROM OVER
POLICING LIKE THE HEART PROGRAM. THE COUNCIL HAS A UNIQUE
OPPORTUNITY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY DIVEST AND INVEST. BOTH POLICY
ORDERS WOULD FIGHT AGAINST DAILY VIOLENCE AND ALIGN THE FINANCIAL
COMMITMENTS WITH THE ETHICAL VALUES. I URGE YOU TO TAKE UP THE
CHANCE AND VOTE YES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS GUSTAVE NEXT?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU. I'M A PH.D. STUDENT AT HARVARD AND A
HISTORIAN OF COLONIALISM AND I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE
POLICY ORDERS. ASKING FOR DIVESTMENT FROM COMPANIES, COMPLICIT IN
ISRAELI APARTHEID. I UNDERSTAND CAMBRIDGE HAS A HISTORY OF
OPPOSING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS NOT
BEING SINGLED OUT. MULTIPLE HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, THEY HAVE
ISSUED REPORTS DOCUMENTING AND RECOGNIZING THE STATE GUILTY.
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. OPPOSING IS NOT ANTISemitic, IT IS A HUMAN
RIGHTS ISSUE. I ASK YOU UPHOLD THE TRADITION OF CAMBRIDGE TO FIGHT
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND GLOBAL JUSTICE BY COMMITTING TO THE REVIEW
AND DIVESTMENT FROM ANY COMPANY. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT
FOR 114, CALLING FOR THE CITY TO IMPLEMENT THE HEART PROPOSAL.
THANK YOU.

>> HI. I LIVE NEARBY. I WORK IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO
SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER ABOUT HP AND 114 AND 129. I'M HERE AS A
JEWISH AMERICAN DISGUSTED BY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION IN MY NAME.
YOU HEARD THIS WEEK AND LAST WEEK, ABOUT HOW HP WILL CONTRIBUTE
TO THE APARTHEID STATE. I URGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THOSE WHO PUT
THEMSELVES AT RISK.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
DO NOT BE DISTRACTED. OPPOSING ISRAEL IS NOT ANTISEMITISM. I URGE
YOU TO CONSIDER HOW THE VIOLENCE CONTRIBUTES TO RACIST POLICING IN
OUR BACKYARD. RACIAL JUSTICE HERE IS BOUND UP WITH RACIAL JUSTICE
EVERYWHERE. IT IS TOO IMPORTANT TO DELAY AND SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
DELAYED LAST WEEK. VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JESSICA.
>> JESSICA, HANNAH, HAVE NOT JOINED. WE'LL GO TO ZEVA. GO AHEAD.
>> HI. ZIVAH. I WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE CAMBRIDGE
AREA. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER 109.
CAMBRIDGE SHOULDN'T BE COMPLICIT IN THE HUMAN RIGHT ABUSES AND
THE APARTHEID ISRAEL IS COMMITTING AGAINST PALESTINIAN. WE DON'T
CONFLATE JUDAISM WITH THE VIOLATIONS AGAINST PALESTINIANS. I WILL
SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF POLICY ORDER 114, WE SHOULD FIND ALTERNATIVES
TO THE POLICING IN THE COMMUNITY AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO KIT.
>> HI. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER.
THIS POLICY ORDER PUTS NONVIOLENT PRESSURE ON HP AND OTHER
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO STOP ENABLING VIOLENCE AGAINST
PALESTINIANS. HP MAKES THE APARTHEID POSSIBLE. THANKS TO HP, MANY
PALESTINIANS LIVE AS PRISONERS FROM THE DAY THEY ARE BORN UNTIL THEY
DAY. HOMES, LIVELIHOODS, AND LIVES CAN BE STOLEN. WE HERE IN
CAMBRIDGE HAVE THE CHANCE TO END OUR COMPLICIT, TELL HP YOU CAN
PROFIT OFF APART TIED OR OFF OF US. TOGETHER, WE CAN FORCE HP TO
MAKE A CHOICE. WE CAN DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW IN CAMBRIDGE THAT
CAN HELP FREE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. KNOWING THAT, HOW CAN WE DO
OTHERWISE? WE HAVE THE POWER TO ACT, WE HAVE THE POWER TO LEAD,
AND WE MUST. PLEASE ENACT PO 109, DIVEST FROM HP AND THE
COMPLICITY. AND END THE APARTHEID. THANK YOU.
>> MONTY. LIFE TIME RESIDENT. I LOVE PRIVACY. I SUPPORT THE POLICY
ORDER. I WILL REFOCUS US ON THE PARTICULAR, IDENTIFY ANY COMPANIES
THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF CAMBRIDGE POLICY ON DISCRIMINATION,
INCLUDING, HP AND NOT

I DON'T CARE WHAT COMPANY OR WHAT COUNTRY. I STAND WITH
PALESTINIANS AND I WANT THE POLICY ORDER BECAUSE IT WILL PUT
CAMBRIDGE'S MONEY WHERE THE MOUTH IS. I SUPPORT THE 114 TO
ALLOCATE FUNDING TO THE HEART PROGRAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO
POLICING. THIS PROGRAM IS CREATED COLLABORATIVELY BY AND WITH
BLACK, BROWN, AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN CAMBRIDGE AND A
COALITION OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITY BASED PROCESS. IT IS LESS
SURVEILLANCE. IT WILL CREATE FREEDOM AND HEALING AND PEACE. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE GO TO JP, WHO IS BACK.
>> HELLO. THANK YOU. I'M JP. 276 WASHINGTON STREET. I HAVE BEEN A
RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE OF EIGHT YEARS AND HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE
YES TO END BUSINESS TIES WITH HP ENTERPRISE. I'M AN IMMIGRANT. I
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS TO LIVE THROUGH A CONFLICT THAT IS FUNDED
THROUGH UNITED STATES MONEY. I THINK THAT SHOULD END. I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD DO OUR PART LOCALLY TO SEE THAT TO HAPPEN.
JEWISH, CHRISTIAN, AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES EXISTED IN PALESTINE
BEFORE OCCUPATION, AND I HOPE ONE DAY TO SEE THIS WITH MY OWN
EYES. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I ALSO REJECT ALL FORMS OF
ANTISEMITISM. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR ANTISEMITISM IN THE FIGHT FOR A
FREE PALESTINE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JEAN?
>> JEAN, IF YOU ARE IN THE ZOOM, RAISE YOUR HAND. I SEE A NAME, BUT
THERE'S NO LAST NAME.
>> I LIVED HERE FOR 40 YEARS. I MENTIONED LAST TIME, I WAS A MEMBER
OF THE FIRST JP BOARD AND HELP TO FORM THE LOCAL CHAPTER. I DO THIS
WORK BECAUSE I GREW UP I STRONGLY SUPPORT BOTH POLICY ORDERS. I
BELIEVE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE OCCUPIED, RESISTANCE IS JUSTIFIED. IT IS
US, THE UNITED STATES, THAT HAS TO CHANGE THE PALESTINIAN CALL FOR
FREEDOM, JUSTICE, AND EQUALITY, IF IT IS TO BE REALIZED. IF RACISM IS TO
BE FACED IN AMERICA AND THE ECONOMIC JUSTICE IS SERIOUSLY
ADDRESSED. FOR PALESTINIANS, WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY, THE
UNITED STATES, MILITARY, DIPLOMATICALLY, AND POLITICALLY. I WISH I
COULD GIVE EXAMPLES
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. GOING TO LENOX
NEXT.
>> DIANE, PLEASE GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M FORMER MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE
COMMUNITY AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE RESOLUTIONS. IT IS APPALLING
TO ME THIS IS A QUESTION. I WOULD URGE ALL OF YOU TO READ THE SON OF
HAMAS, WHICH EXPLAINS FROM THE SON OF A FORMER FOUNDER OF THE
KNOWN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, HOW ISRAEL IS BEING DEMONIZED AND
THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP IS TO BLAME FOR MUCH OF THE CONFLICT.
BESIDES RETURNING TO THE RESOLUTION, IT DOES NOT PROMOTE PEACE, IT

DOESN'T HELP MAKE THINGS MOVE FORWARD. I'M APPALLED BY THIS
SITUATION. I HAVE LEFT MY OWN COUNTRY, FRANCE, AGE OF 18. I LIVED
HERE BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS A SAFER PLACE AND I'M SEEING THE TIDAL
WAVE COMING ALONG. IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD. STAND FOR THE VALUES
AND THAT MEANS OPPOSING THE POLICY ORDERS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ISHRAQ?
>> NAOMI, GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE COUNCIL FOR LISTENING TO THE EXTENSIVE
TESTIMONY. AND I APPRECIATE LAST WEEK ACCOMODATION THAT ALLOWS
ME TO BE HERE. I RESIDE IN INMAN SQUARE. I'M HERE TO VOICE MY
OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY ORDERS. ANTIZIONISM IS NOT ANTISEMITISM.
CERTAIN FORMS ALWAYS FUEL ANTI SEMITISM. AND BOYCOTTS COLLEGE
CAMPUSES STRONG BDS PRESENT THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE ANTISEMITISM.
I'M SICK OF THE VIOLENCE CAUSED BY HAMAS AND IN ISRAEL ABROAD AND
SICK OF THE DRASTIC ANTISEMITISM IN THE UNITED STATES. LAST WEEK,
DURING THE MEETING, I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING OVER 100 JEWISH
PEOPLE SAFE IN AN OUTDOOR EVENT, FOR WHICH WE DIDN'T ASK FOR
POLICE PROTECTION. AS A STRONG ADVOCATE, I URGE YOU TO ADOPT THE
BOTH RESOLUTIONS THAT APPROVE LIVES AND RELATIONSHIPS. NOT FUEL
HATRED. THANK YOU.

SECOND. NEXT PERSON, GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? HI, MY LAST IS ARABIC, WHICH MEANS LOVE FOR MY
PEOPLE. AND I STRONGLY I HAVE BEEN IN CAMBRIDGE FOR THE LAST
THREE YEARS. I'M AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER AND URGE YOU TO DO SO AS
WELL. AS MY NAME SAYS, LOVE FOR MY PEOPLE, LOVE FOR ALL PEOPLE. AND
THIS POLICY IS SOMETHING THAT IS COMING TO US COMING TOGETHER
AND DIVIDING US AND I HOPE WE CAN PUT THAT ASIDE AND FIND THE LOVE
FOR ONE ANOTHER AND BRING US TOGETHER.
AS A PROUD AMERICAN AND I'M CURRENTLY RESIDING IN THE BIRTH PLACE
OF THE UNITED STATES DEMOCRACY, I OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE ISRAEL IS
DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WITH A LACK OF
NUANCE. SUPPORTING THE BDS BILL WOULDN'T HELP. THANK YOU.

>> HELLO. RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. I AM HERE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE
RESOLUTION. SOMEONE HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT IS A BAD CONFLICT, IT IS
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS. TO THOSE WHO CLAIM ISRAEL IS THE ONLY
DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION, WITH EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL, I WILL POINT OUT
THE CEASE FIRE, ISRAEL IS NOW CONDUCTING RAIDS AND ARRESTS AND
FAMILIES LIVE UNDER THE THREAT OF VIOLATION, EVICTION, AND
DISPOSITION, WHO ARE PROTECTED BY THE STATE. WHEN THE LEGAL
REGIME, THE ABILITY TO MARRY ARE DETERMINED BY THE RELIGIOUS
HERITAGE, THAT IS APARTHEID.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
ENDORSED BY JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS, WORKED IN SOUTH AFRICA AND
DISMANTLING OF THE APARTHEID AND THE DIALOGUE. I URGE YOU TO
STAND UP AND SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS TRUDI?
>> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE
FOR OVER 40 YEARS. MY PARENTS HAD A HARDWARE STORE IN WEST
CAMBRIDGE. I'M A JEWISH PERSON WHO IS ALSO OF JEWISH ARABIC SOME
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO. MANY ANCESTORS ARE PALESTINIAN AND LIVE IN
THE REGION THAT IS DESIGNATED AS PALESTINE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHY I DON'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD POLICY ORDER.
IT IS LESS TO DO WITH BDS, WHICH I DESPISE, IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE
FACT THAT IS SETTING PEOPLE'S AT EACH OTHER'S THROAT. I BELIEVE IN
WORKING FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. I ALWAYS HAVE. I'M A ZIONIST,
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I AGREE WITH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT OF THE
ISRAEL. YOU WILL FIND MANY THAT DON'T. IT IS VOICED THAT THE PEOPLE
THERE ARE RACIST. I'M A MIXED JEW AND THERE ARE MANY MIXED JEWS IN
ISRAEL. GOOD EVENING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JANE CARPENTER?
>> HI. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS. I LIVE ON ESSEX
STREET. GRADUATE OF THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I CALL TO
URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS. ONE OF MY CLOSEST
FRIENDS, PALESTINIAN, AND SHE ADVOCATED FOR HER COMMUNITY. IT
TAKES A TOLL TO ADVOCATE CONSTANTLY FOR BASIC RIGHTS.

THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE WHAT HP DOES IN OUR COUNTRY, PROVIDING
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE MASS INCARCERATION,

>> HELLO. HI. SO, I'D LIKE TO ABANDONED WHAT I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO
SAY. TO REPORT SOME STATS THAT I GOT FROM THE MEETING TODAY.
FROM 7:53 TONIGHT, 17 PEOPLE VOICE THE OPINION TO SUPPORT POLICY
ORDER 114. YET, MANY PEOPLE VOTED AGAINST 109. AND THERE IS NO
MENTION OF 114. I GUESS MY QUESTION TO CAMBRIDGE IS... THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE, CONCERNED CITIZENS, HOW ARE YOU OKAY OR UNAWARE OF
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH BLACK RESIDENTS, BROWN RESIDENT, THAT
ADVOCATE FOR PROTECTION AND AID IN THE CITY. HOW ARE YOU NOT
TALKING ABOUT THAT? BUT ALSO SPEAKING SO STRONGLY ABOUT
PROTECTION OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE. I THINK AS ALL CITIZENS OF ONE CITY,
YOU NEED TO STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER AND SHOW THAT NEIGHBORLY
LOVE AND TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO EVE?
>> GRADUATE OF HARVARD AND RETURN TO CAMBRIDGE TO RAISE MY
THREE CHILDREN IN A SOCIAL JUSTICE ORIENTED COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW
THE PROPOSITIONS HAVE NO LEGAL PURPOSE. THEY ARE SIMPLY
DECLARATIONS OF DEMONIZATION. FALSE AND MISLEADING CLAIMS THAT
DEMONIZE JEWS AND POLICE. IF PASSED, THE PROPOSITIONED WILL RIGHTLY
BE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD AS ACTS OF ANTISEMITISM. THEY WILL
STRENGTHEN THE HAND OF Zionist HARDLINERS. MAKE IT EASIER FOR
AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES TO OPPOSE POLICE REFORM AND SUPPORT THE
INDEFENSIBLE REGIME. PLEASE DON'T PUT A TARGET ON MY CHILDREN'S
BACKS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: RACHEL GREEN?
>> I'M RACHEL. I LIVE ON ESSEX STREET. AND I APPOSE THE POLICY ORDER.
A JEWISH RESIDENT, I FEEL PHYSICALLY UNSAFE IN MY CITY. JUST THIS PAST
WEEK, DURING OUTDOOR PRAYER, MEMBERS NEED TO HIRE AN ARMED
GUARD. AS WE DIDN'T FEEL SAFE. INSTEAD OF PROTECTING THE MINORITY
GROUP IN CAMBRIDGE, THIS EXACERBATES THE DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE
RESOLUTION IS ONE SIDED AND PROPOSES TO HOLD HP TO A STANDARD
THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO CAMBRIDGE BASE COMPANIES. FOR EXAMPLE,
MANY COMPANIES WITH PRESENCE IN CAMBRIDGE HAVE ITEMS IN THE
SUPPLY CHAIN CREATED BY SLAVE LABOR. WE HAVE NOT HAD A DIRECT
PURCHASE ORDER WITH HP IN SEVEN YEARS. THIS RESOLUTION IS WANT
FIGHTING FOR IT IS MAKING A DANGEROUS STATEMENT, DEMONIZING
ISRAEL, IGNORING THE FACT THAT ISRAEL IS AGAINST THE RECOGNIZED
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS POLICY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO NEXT PERSON.
>> I HAVE MAYA NEXT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DID WE HEAR FROM MAYA? MAYBE NOT.
>> I THINK IT WAS A DIFFERENT MAYA. GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. I'M MAYA. I LIVE ON PUTNAM AVENUE. I FIND THIS BACKWARDS
THAT YOU INVEST MONEY TO PROMOTE ANTIRACISM AND YOU SEEK TO
ENACT POLICY ORDERS THAT FURTHER RACISM AGAINST YOUR JEWISH

RESIDENTS. ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT ISRAEL IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN
APARTHEID STATE, MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS THE FOLLOWING HAVE YOU
ENACTED ANY OTHER POLICIES AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES IN RECENT
HISTORY? I ASK YOU TO LOOK INTO YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELF, WHY
ARE YOU SINGLING OUT THE STATE OF ISRAEL? IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU
HAVE SOME SORT OF IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST JEWS? ANTISemitic ATTACKS
AGAINST JEWS ARE RISING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PROTECT YOUR
JEWISH RESIDENTS? I CAN TELL YOU AS A JEWISH RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE,
YOU ARE CREATING AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR US WITH THIS
ANTISemitic LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE HEARD FROM JUDITH. NEXT PERSON. I
DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE ON THE ZOOM.
>> LOOKING FOR THE NEXT PERSON. THERE ARE A FEW WHO ARE NOT ON.
GO AHEAD, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. PH.D. STUDENT AT MIT AND A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I'M AN
AMERICAN ISRAELI JEW. I STAND FIRMLY AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER AND
AGAINST 129. I WANT TO REMIND YOU THE BDS MOVEMENT WILL OPPOSE
THE TWO STATE MOVEMENT. EXCUSING ACTIONS OF TERRORISM, I WAS IN
ISRAEL, THREE TEENAGER BOYS WERE KIDNAPPED AND MURDERED BY
HAMAS. THEY WERE NOT SOLDIERS. THEY WERE NOT OPPRESSORS, THEY
WERE KIDS. I LIKE TO STRESS THE CITY SHOULD ENSURE THE SAFETY,
SECURITY, AND WELL BEING OF ALL. I CANNOT FEEL SAFE IN A CITY THAT
ACCEPTS A ONE SIDED AND OVER SIMPLIFIED NARRATIVE OF A COMPLICATED
AND PAINFUL CONFLICT. OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, I LIVED FROM PANIC
ATTACK TO PANIC ATTACK, I FELT AND STILL FEEL UNSAFE BECAUSE I'M
WORRIED MY JEWISH IDENTITY AND MY CONNECTION TO ISRAEL WILL MAKE
ME INTO A TARGET AS HAPPENED TO SO MANY JEWS AROUND THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KEN HERE?
>> THE CLERK SAID WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM JUDITH YET. WE'LL CALL HER.
>> I THOUGHT WE SUSPENDED TO HEAR FROM JUDITH. MAYBE THAT WAS
ANOTHER ONE. IT IS A LONG NIGHT.
>> YOU ARE CORRECT. WE HEARD FROM THEM AT THE TOP. NEXT IT
SHOULD BE KEN. KEN IS NOT ON. I'M LOOKING FOR THE NEXT PERSON.
DAVID, GO AHEAD. UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. OPPOSING THE POLICY ORDER.
BDS IS NOT FOR PEACE OR HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS THE DESTRUCTION PURPOSE
OF ISRAEL. THE MEANS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIANS. ENCOURAGES
VIOLENCE LIKE THE ROCKETS FIRED IN RECENT WEEKS. I WILL READ A
TRANSCRIPT. THE PALESTINIAN BUILD YOU WANT TO BOMB, BOMB
WHATEVER YOU WANT. NO BROTHER, WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
SO YOU DON'T DIE. (CITING QUOTES).

TERRORIST RATHER THAN THE JEWISH STATE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT. YOUR TIME IS UP. PERCY.
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HI. I HAVE LIVED ON HANCOCK STREET FOR 13 YEARS. I'M HERE TO VOICE
THE OPPOSITION TO POLICY ORDER 109. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY THE COUNCIL
IS WILL FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE, GIVEN THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE CONTRACTS
WITH HP. I'M DISAPPOINTED MY REPRESENTATIVES ARE SPENDING TIME
PROPOSING RESOLUTIONS THAT SINGLE OUT AND ALIGN ISRAEL UNDER THE
GUISE AND CONCERNS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO
VOTE AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DEANNA?
>> HELLO. GOOD EVENING. I'M A JEWISH RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. I URGE
YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDER TO END THE CITY'S CONTRACT
WITH HP AND OTHER COMPANIES COMPLICIT IN APARTHEID. AS A JEW, I'M
CONCERNED ABOUT CRITICISMS THAT BDS IS ANTISemitic OR ANTIJEWISH.
CALLING BDS ANTISemitic IS DEPLETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS CRITICAL
WE ARE ABLE TO CRITIQUE AS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT PERPETRATING
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY
ORDER TO SHOW SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINIANS AND VOICE MY SUPPORT
FOR POLICY ORDER 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. I'M A COMMUNITY MEMBER. I URGE YOU TO UNANIMOUSLY
VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109 AND 114. DIVESTING FROM COMPANIES
THAT SUPPORT ETHNIC CLEANSING, GENOCIDE OF PALESTINIANS IS NOT AND
SHOULDN'T BE CONTROVERSIAL NOR IS IT ANTI Semitic. IT IS TIME TO DIVEST
FROM HP AND INVEST IN THE CAMBRIDGE HEART PROGRAM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, WE HAVE ELIZABETH MILLER.
>> HI. GOOD EVENING. I'M A PROUD ALUMINA OF THE HARVARD GRADUATE
SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND A JEW. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN
OPPOSITION TO THE PUBLIC ORDERS 109 AND 129. I'M SHOCKED AND
APPALLED THE CITY ON THE JEWISH HOLIDAY WAS WILLING TO CONSIDER AN
ANTISemitic MEASURES BECAUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE, THEY ARE ANTISemitic.
THE GOAL OF BDS IS ELIMINATING ISRAEL AS A JEWISH STATE. THEY CRITICIZE
ONLY ISRAEL, SUCH IMPLICIT SCAPEGOATING WON'T BRING PEACE. I WILL
SAY A FEW NOTES ABOUT THE MOVEMENT AND THE OCCUPATION BY ISRAEL
OF PALESTINIAN LANDS. JEWS ARE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND HAVE A CLAIM
TO ISRAEL. ISRAEL HAS OFFERED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE WEST BANK TO
CREATE A PALESTINIAN STATE. THEY HAVE REJECTED EACH OFFER. I HOPE
THE COUNCIL WILL DENOUNCE THIS AND STAND UP FOR
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).

A VOLUNTEER, AND VOTER IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE
IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDER 114 AND POLICY ORDER 109. 114 IS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED ALTERNATIVES TO POLICE IN CAMBRIDGE.
AND WE NEED THEM NOW. I WANT MY TAX DOLLARS AND OUR BUDGET TO
FUND THE HOLISTIC EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE TEAM.
OTHERWISE, KNOWN AS THE HEART PROPOSAL. THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE
PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM WITH THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE
TRANSFORMATIVE JUSTICE AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE COMPONENTS. I'M A
SURVIVOR OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF VIOLENCE AND ASSAULTS, I GREW UP IN A
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOME. POLICE DO NOT MAKE ME, MY FAMILY, OR MY
COMMUNITY, FEEL SAFE. I REJECT ALL FORMS OF ANTISEMITISM AND
SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 109. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR DOLLARS
REPRESENT OUR VALUES AND THAT WE DO NOT ENGAGE COMPANIES THAT
PARTICIPATE IN VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SHAI?
>> THANK YOU FOR THIS STAGE. I'M SPEAKING FROM I'M A CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENT. ISRAELI IS THE UNITED STATES BIGGEST ALLY. THIS IS REALIZED
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THIS CAN CAUSE DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT. THERE'S NO
APARTHEID REGIME IN ISRAEL. THEY PROVIDE EQUAL RIGHTS TO ALL ARAB
CITIZENS, IN WHICH THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY, SERVE AS SUPREME
COURT JUDGES, MANY OF THE COMMENTS HERE ARE UNINFORMED AND
MISLEADING. ISRAELI COMPANY PROVIDE HUGE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE
CITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. HAVE NO MISTAKE. IF YOU
PASS THIS REQUEST, THE NEXT WILL THEY BRING $18 BILLION TO THE
REGION. I HOPE YOU OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, I BELIEVE IT IS ROBERT.
>> HI, ROBERT. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE 109. LAST MONDAY, IN THE MIDST
OF THE HOLIDAY, HOLIDAY THAT CELEBRATES ACCEPTANCE, I WITNESSED A
SHAMEFUL AGAINST MY PEOPLE. RIGHT HERE IN THE CAMBRIDGE CITY
HALL. ONE OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IS SHALL NOT BEAR WITNESS,
ATTEMPTS TO COME TO THE FALSE AND ONE SIDED CONCLUSION, THE
VIOLENT EVENTS IN THE UNITED STATES CITIES AGAINST JEWS DEMONSTRATE
THE ATMOSPHERE BY THE RHETORIC EXPRESSED HERE AGAINST ISRAEL AND
THE JEWISH PEOPLE. ONE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER IS ON THE RECORD SAYING
THE MESSAGE IS LAST WEEK WAS IT DIDN'T SEEM TO PREVENT THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT.
EXERCISE CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE ACT OF DISCRIMINATION AND YOU CALL FOR
DISCRIMINATION
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP.
>> HI. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT AND
MOTHER OF FOUR KIDS HERE. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. THIS POLICY
ORDER IS DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ISRAELI IMMIGRANTS, LIKE MYSELF,
DANGEROUS TO MY AMERICAN KIDS AND UNFAIRLY USES CAMBRIDGE AND
THE REPUTATION AS A BDS TOOL TO SINGLE OUT ISRAEL. IT IS HAMAS THAT IS
TERRORIZING PALESTINIANS AND USING KIDS FOR COVER. HAMAS, NOT

AGAINST ISRAEL AND THE VALUES IT HOLDS. PLEASE BASE YOUR HEARTFELT
DECISION ON TRUTH AND FACTS. NOT ON THE DISTORTED PICTURE. REJECT
109. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

>> JOAN, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNABLE TO MUTE.
MARILYN, GO AHEAD.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR 40 YEARS. RETIRED
UMASS BOSTON QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROFESSOR. I'M SPEAKING TO
STRONGLY SUPPORT 109 FOR BDS. AND 114 THE HEART PROPOSAL. I'M AN
OLD JEWISH LADY. I FEEL TRAUMATIZED AND UNSAFE WHEN I HEAR ALL THE
LIES AND DISINFORMATION AND ILLOGICAL ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY
OPPONENTS OF BDS. I FEEL SAFE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT
BDS IN THE HEART PROPOSAL. LAST WEEK, STATED STRONG SUPPORT FOR
109 TO HONOR THE COMMITMENT CAMBRIDGE MADE IN 2009 TO CONDEMN
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN PALESTINE. I WANT TO ADD MY STRONG
SUPPORT FOR THE HEART PROPOSAL. DEVELOPED THROUGH AN IMPRESSIVE
COMMUNITY LED PROCESS. BOTH THE POLICIES OFFER PEACEFUL SOLUTION
FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY. VOTE YES ON BOTH OF THEM. THIS WILL MAKE
EVERYONE IN CAMBRIDGE SAFE.

>> THANKS. I'M ADAM. I'M A JEWISH RESIDENT OF 52 PLEASANT STREET IN
CAMBRIDGE. A FACULTY MEMBER AT HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH.
I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY BY PASSING THE POLICY
ORDERS. 109 IS AN ESSENTIAL MEASURE TO PRESSURE ISRAEL TO STOP THE
VIOLENT OPPRESSION AND IT IS CYNICAL TO LABEL IT ANTISemitic.
PARTICULARLY WHEN SUPPORTED BY SO MANY JEWS. I SUPPORT THE
PALESTINIAN CALL FOR BDS. THE 20 JEWISH COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO
SPOKE IN FAVOR LAST WEEK SUPPORT BDS. MANY MORE TONIGHT SUPPORT
BDS. THE 2018 SURVEY OF OVER 1,000 JEWS ALL OF THE ANTIZIONIST
AMERICAN JEWS ANTISemitic. IT IS RIDICULOUS TO SUGGEST THEY ARE AND
EQUALLY RIDICULOUS TO SYSTEM PEACEFUL PROTEST OF THE BRUTAL
COLONIZATION CAN BE ANTI Semitic. YOU MUST CUT TIE WITH HP AND
INVEST IN COMMUNITY ALTERNATIVES TO POLICING BY PASSING 114.

>> THANK YOU. MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, THANK YOU FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE POLICY ORDER S.
REGARDING THE CONTRACT WITH HP AND OTHER COMPANIES COMPLICIT IN
APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAMBRIDGE HEART PROGRAM.
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIVING UNDER OCCUPATION AND APARTHEID STATE, THEY
CAN RESIST AND ONE FORM OF RESISTANCE BEING CALLED FOR BY CIVIL
SOCIETY IS TO BOYCOTT SPECIFIC CORPORATIONS. THEY PROFIT OFF THE

OCCUPATION. CAMBRIDGE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP ON HUMAN
AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND TO KEEP THAT LEADERSHIP, CAMBRIDGE MUST BRING
THE CITY'S INVESTMENT AND CONTRACTUAL PRACTICES IN LINE WITH
INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR SOLIDARITY TO DEMAND HUMAN RIGHTS. A
JEWISH PERSON, I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE WITH YOUR HEART TO SUPPORT
INTERNATIONAL CALLS FOR SOLIDARITY, SO WE CAN INCH CLOSE TO
LIBERATION FOR ALL. LIKE IT WAS SAID, CAMBRIDGE SHOULD BE PROUD TO
END CONTRACTS WITH THE COMPANY PROFITING OFF OF MILITARIZATION. I
NEED THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO INVEST IN ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC SAFETY
INFRASTRUCTURE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK LILY IS HERE OR NOOR.
>> I'M DAVID. 27 YEAR RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE. 30 YEAR MEMBER OF THE
UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF CARPENTERS. AND I'M SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION
TO POLICY ORDER 109. I'M AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THREE REASONS.
ONE, THE PROPOSAL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WELFARE OF
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND NOT WISE USE OF THE HUMAN AND ECONOMIC
RESOURCES. THE LEGISLATION IS EXPLICITLY PART OF THE GLOBAL BOYCOTT
DIVESTMENT AND SANCTIONS MOVEMENT AGAINST ISRAEL. PURPOSE OF
BDS IS NOT TO PROTEST THE OCCUPATION OR CHANGE ISRAELI POLICY, TO
ISOLATE AND PRESSURE ISRAEL UNTIL IT CEASES TO EXIST. IT WILL
ENCOURAGE PARTIES TO DIG IN. AND THERE ARE CONFLICTS IN THE WORLD
ONGOING. MILLIONS BEING REPRESSED BY CHINA, THE COUNCIL FINDS THAT
ISRAEL ALONE IS DESERVING OF BLAME. THIS IS ANTISemitic
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE DOMINIQUE NEXT.
>> SPEAK ON BEHALF OF A RESIDENT OF SACRAMENTO STREET IN
CAMBRIDGE. I WILL SUPPORT THIS POLICY ORDER, REQUIRE THE CITY
MANAGER TO REVIEW CORPORATE CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES THAT
VIOLATE THE POLICY ON DISCRIMINATION. SINCE 2003, I HAVE
PHOTOGRAPHED ASPECTS OF THE CONFLICT IN PALESTINE. AT TIMES, HP
SUPPORTS AND PROFITS FROM THE OCCUPATION OF THE WEST BANK AND
THE SIEGE. IN PARTICULAR, BY INSTALLING AND SUPPORTING SYSTEMS
DENY THEM WATER AND HEALTHCARE IN THE GAZA STRIP AND IMPRISONED
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. CAMBRIDGE ENDED COMPLICIT WITH POLAROID OF
THE SOUTH AFRICAN SUFFERING. THE CURRENT SITUATION IN PALESTINE,
PARALLELS WHAT HAPPENS IN SOUTH AFRICA. THIS IS A MORAL AND
HUMANITARIAN LAW ISSUE. WE AS THE CITY CAN FOSTER JUSTICE AND
COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. CORINNA?
>> HI. CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY MEMBER. I WANT TO URGE YOU TO VOTE
YES ON BOTH POLICY ORDERS. DURING THE RECENT ISRAELI BOMBING OF
CIVILIANS IN GAZA WITH UNITED STATES MADE BOMBS, WE HAVE SEEN HOW
DEEP THIS GOES. THOUSANDS HAVE COME OUT IN SOLIDARITY AND MORE
PROGRESSIVE POLITICIANS ARE SPEAKING OUT. IT IS APPARENT THAT
SUPPORTING THE SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION THAT ISRAEL WILL IMPOSE, WILL
NO LONGER BE VIABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES PROGRESSIVE. I


PAGE 55

May 24, 2021

URGE YOU TO CONSIDER WHICH SIDE OF HISTORY THEY WISH TO BE ON AND
WANT CAMBRIDGE TO BE ON IN THE CHOICE TODAY. THE POLICY ORDERS
ARE COMPLEMENTARY. THE FIRST DIVEST CAMBRIDGE FROM SYSTEMATIC
OPPRESSION, THE SECOND WILL CREATE SYSTEMS OF CARE TAKING IN THE
CITY. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT HEART AND TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, THOSE SUFFERING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND
WITHOUT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT PERSON.
>> HI, CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF REVOLUTION
CAMBRIDGE IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS. IT IS A TRANSFORMATIVE
VISION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY DEVELOPED THROUGH PARTICIPATORY PROCESS,
INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES NEIGHBORHOOD HELP, HUMAN SERVICES, AND
FAITH ORGANIZATIONS, AND CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY. INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HEART IS ROOTED IN
COMMUNITY NEEDS. I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF 109, YOU HEARD IS
ANTISemitic AND OUT TO DESTROY THE SAY THE OF ISRAEL. THIS IS NOT THE
CASE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. NEXT PERSON? ARE
THROUGH?
>> HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. GO AHEAD. CAN YOU HEAR US?
>> I CAN. CAN WE START AGAIN FROM THE TOP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: START THE CLOCK AGAIN. GO AHEAD.
>> CARA, EAST CAMBRIDGE. TESTIMONY IS THIS, ISN'T THERE ENOUGH
DIVISIVENESS IN THE WORLD? WHAT POSSIBLE PURPOSE DOES THIS ORDER
SERVE? WILL IT SOLVE NOTHING ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, BUT
INSIGHT STRIVE AND VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY. NO MISTAKE
CONTINUING TO BLAME ISRAEL FOR WANTING TO EXIST IS ANTISEMITISM.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE AGAINST HAMAS, A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, THIS
ORDER IS AN ANTISemitic AND DISCRIMINATORY ACT MAKING ME FEAR FOR
MYSELF AND FAMILY. INSTEAD OF TAKING THE STEP, THE COUNCIL LOOK AT
WHAT IT CAN DO TO ADDRESS ANTISEMITISM IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE
ARE INCIDENTS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH LANGUAGE WRITTEN ON THE
WALLS. I SUGGEST THE COUNCIL WORK WITH THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE TO
CREATE A CURRICULUM BASED
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. ALIAS?
>> HI. PEDIATRICIAN AT BOSTON CHILDREN HOSPITAL AND A ASSISTANT
PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS AT HARVARD. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MYSELF. I
SPEAK TODAY AS A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, A PARENT, AND AN AMERICAN. I
KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT OCCUPATION AND ABOUT STATE SANCTIONED
VIOLENCE. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 109 AS WELL
AS 114. THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED. I ASK YOU IN ADDITION AS A
PEDIATRICIAN TO SPEAK UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING SO WE'RE NOT


PAGE 56

May 24, 2021

COMMITTING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST CHILDREN. 63 CHILDREN
HAVE DIED IN THE LAST DURING THE LAST WAR. THAT'S THEY ARE
ORPHANED, SUFFERING FROM MALNUTRITION. AND SCHOOLS ARE
DESTROYED AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL ARE TARGETED. THIS IS STATE
SANCTIONED VIOLENCE AND I ASK YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING AS A
PROGRESSIVE CITY AND UPHOLD THE IDEALS AND BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF
HISTORY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> NEXT SPEAKER IS LAYLA.
>> HI. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 43 YEARS. AND RAISED
THREE CHILDREN. I'M PALESTINIAN AMERICAN. AND EVERY VISIT HOME HAS
BEEN WORSE. I SEE MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS BEING SQUEEZED IN SMALLER
AND SMALLER SPACES. I MYSELF WITNESSED HOW THE DATA COLLECTION
AFFECTED ME AS I TRAVEL ACROSS. WE NEED SAFETY OF THE HUMAN
BEINGS IS MORE THAN IMPORTANT THAN ACTUAL MONEY. LET'S PUT PEOPLE
BEFORE PROFITS. I SUPPORT 109 AND 114 BECAUSE FOR US, IT IS THE SAME
KIND OF SITUATION. PEOPLE NEED HUMAN DIGNITY, CARE, TREATMENT FOR
STRESS, FOR VIOLENCE. THE SAME IS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES. AS
IT IS IN THE UNDER OCCUPATION. THIS IS NOT ANTISemitic BECAUSE I HAVE
A LOT OF JEWISH FRIENDS, MY FAMILY IS MIXED HISTORY IN THE
BACKGROUND, WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS
JUSTICE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. I THINK THAT WAS TIME. SORRY. WE HAD
AN ISSUE WITH THE TIMER. CLERK, LET ME KNOW WHEN THE TIMER IS FIXED.
>> THE TIME IS EXPIRED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON IS HENRY.
>> HELLO. I'M HENRY. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR REVOLUTION
CAMBRIDGE. I LIVE IN BERKSHIRE STREET. I'M NOT SPEAKING TONIGHT AS A
VICTIM OR AS A VOICE FOR THE OPPRESSED, BUT AS AN ALLY. THERE IS AN
ENORMOUS DISPARITY OF POWER IN PALESTINE WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL
THE BENEFICIARY OF BILLIONS IN UNITED STATES AID. AS AN ALLY OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT POLICIES OF NETANYAHU,
AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL, I DON'T RECOGNIZE AS AN ALLY ANYONE WHO
OPPOSES THE POLICY ORDERS THAT WILL REDUCE IN THE SMALLEST WAY THE
AID TO THE MILITARY AND SECURITY ARM OF THE OPPRESSIVE FORCE. I
RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF A MOVEMENT TO SUPPORT THE PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE AND THE CITY COUNCIL CAN HELP THAT MOVEMENT GROW. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE NEXT PERSON.
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU ARE FREE TO SPEAK.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M VERED, WE LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I HAVE BEEN LIVING
HERE FOR LIKE ABOUT 21 YEARS. I ALSO WORK IN CAMBRIDGE FOR AN
ISRAELI PHARMA COMPANY. I'M OPPOSING A POLICY ORDER 109. SORRY

May 24, 2021

ABOUT THAT. SORRY ABOUT THAT. THEY MISPLACED MY GLASSES. I CAN'T
READ WHAT IS IN FRONT OF ME. I THINK YOU CAN GO AHEAD. SORRY ABOUT
THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. IS MARK ON THE ZOOM?
>> I THINK WE SHOULD PAUSE FOR A SECOND. I HAVE TO RESET THE TIMER.
IT IS HAVING A GLITCH. I WILL RESET IT AND GO BACK TO THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY.
>> WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>> HELLO. I'M MARK. LIVE ON CAMBRIDGE STREET. I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES
ON THE POLICY ORDER. HP PROVIDES PC TO THE ISRAELI MILITARY, WHICH
ARE USED AS PART OF THE ARSENAL TO CARRY OUT MURDERS, INCLUDING
CHILDREN. LIKE LAST WEEK'S ASSAULT ON GAZA. CHARACTERIZED AS WAR
CRIMES ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CARRY OUT FORCEFUL
EXPULSIONS FROM PALESTINIANS FROM THE HOME, AND THIS ACTION IS
DEEMED ILLEGAL BY THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF JUSTICE. ISRAELI IS
SUBJECTING THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE TO FORM OF DISCRIMINATION AND
OPPRESSION. THIS IS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND NOTHING ELSE. I URGE
YOU TO HOLD HP ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROFITING FROM THE IMMORAL AND
ILLEGAL ACTS BY TERMINATING ALL CONTRACTS AND PURCHASING WITH HP.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: STUART?
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> OKAY. HELLO. SORRY. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 45 YEARS. I'M HOME
OWNER IN CAMBRIDGE AND CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL PARENT. IF THIS IS A
GENOCIDE OF THE PALESTINIANS, IT IS THE MOST FAILED GENOCIDE
ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME IN THE HUMAN HISTORY. PALESTINIAN
POPULATION HAS INCREASED BY MORE THAN SIX TIMES AND THAT IS SIMPLY
SINCE THE END OF THE WAR ISRAELI WAR OF INDEPENDENCE.
SECONDLY, IF ANTIZIONISM DOESN'T PROMOTE ANTISEMITISM, WHY IS IT
THAT AT RALLIES IN LOS ANGELES AND IN NEW YORK CITY LAST WEEK,
FOLLOWING THE CEASE FIRE, WHEN PEOPLE LEFT PRO HAMAS RALLIES, NOT
PRO PALESTINIAN, BUT PRO HAMAS RALLIES AND DESCENDED ON PEOPLE
WALKING JEWISH GARB, SLAMMED THEM TO THE GROUND, THEY SAY YOU
DAMN ISRAELI OR DAMN JEW. THAT IS THE SADLY WORLD WE LIVE AND
DON'T WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP. WE HAVE CHRIS.
>> CHRIS, UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> THANK YOU. I'M CHRIS. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY
ORDER 109. I HAVE BEEN TO PALESTINE AND ISRAEL TWICE. I SAW THE LONG
NARROW CAGES THAT EVERY MORNING ARE CROWDED SHOULDER TO
SHOULDER WITH HUNDREDS OF PALESTINIANS ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. IT
CAN TAKE THEM ONE, TWO OR THREE HOURS BEFORE THEY GET TO THE


PAGE 58

May 24, 2021

POINT WHERE THE IDENTITY IS CHECKED BY AN ISRAELI SOLDIER USING
SOFTWARE SUPPLIED AND MAINTAINED BY HP.
IN MY TRAVELS, I MET PALESTINIAN ACTIVISTS WHO SAID THERE WILL BE NO
JUSTICE AND NO PEACE WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT YOU CAN. I YES VOTE
ON POLICY ORDER 109 WILL NOT INSTANTLY CHANGE THE WORLD, IT WILL BE
A SMALL, BUT IMPORTANT ADDITION. IT IS WHAT WE CAN DO. AND FOR
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HI THERE. I LIVE IN MASS AVENUE AND A FORMER CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT.
I LIVED THERE FOR TEN YEARS AND HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDERS. DIVESTING FROM COMPANIES THAT FACILITATE
DISPOSITION, AND ETHNIC CLEANSING DOESN'T HARM JEWISH PEOPLE OR
MAKE THEM UNSAFE. HP IS THE SUPPLIER OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTERS TO
AT THIS TIME ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE. IT IS THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE
THAT IMPLEMENTS THE DISPOSITION, ETHNIC CLEANSING AND THE
OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE AND THE PEOPLE. AND JEWISH PEOPLE INSIDE
ISRAEL AND AROUND THE WORLD REJECT DISPOSITION, ETHNIC CLEANSING,
AND ILLEGAL OCCUPATION, WHETHER IT IS DONE BY ISRAEL OR THE UNITED
STATES OR ANY OTHER SETTLER COLONIAL POWER. WE ARE ALL SAFER WHEN
WE REJECT DISPOSITION JEWISH PEOPLE INCLUDED AND FOR THE SAME
REASON I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 114 IN TERMS OF KEEPING US ALL SAFE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CAROLINE?
>> HI. I SPEAK FOR POLICY ORDERS 114 AND 109. 114, THE HEART
PROPOSAL, UNLIKE THE JUST RELEASED PUBLIC SAFETY REPORT COMES OUT
OF A TRANSPARENT AND COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY PROCESS LED BY
THOSE MOST EFFECTED BY CURRENT POLICE ACTION. BASED ON EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH AND CONSULTATION ON BEST PRACTICES, WITH LEADING
ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE EXPERTS, IT WILL PROPOSE TO CENTER MEMBERS OF
MOST AFFECTED MEMBERS AS RESPONDERS AND MANAGEMENT.
CAMBRIDGE HEART IS THE COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE
APPROACH THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND CAN RELY ON. IT WILL CUT
TIES WITH HP, A MAJOR FACILITATOR OF THE SYSTEM ISRAEL HAS CREATED
FOR PALESTINIANS. THAT SYSTEM WITH THE RECENT MASS BOMBINGS
AGAINST GAZA, THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION, HOW IS IT SURPRISING
THERE'S A FOCUS ON ISRAEL? THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. I'M ELIZABETH. WORKED IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IN
CAMBRIDGE FOR NEARLY A DECADE. I SUPPORT CAMBRIDGE SEVERING TIES
WITH HP AND ALL COMPANIES SUPPORTING ISRAELI APARTHEID AND
INVESTING IN COMMUNITY BASED HOLISTIC EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVE
RESPONSE TEAMS/PROGRAMS AND AWAY FROM POLICING SYSTEMS TO
SUPPORT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY MEMBERS BY ADOPTING THE
CAMBRIDGE HEART PROGRAM. HP PROFITS OFF RACISM AND BRUTALITY ALL

EXPLOITS BARELY INCARCERATED LABOR WHILE WINNING CONTRACTS TO
SUPPLY TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING OFFEND ARE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM S.
THE POLICY ORDERS OFFER CAMBRIDGE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST
SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN JUSTICE AND REMOVE SUPPORT FROM
OPPRESSION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DANIEL?
>> HELLO. I'M DANIEL. A COMMUNITY MEMBER AND A JEWISH AMERICAN, I
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. DIVEST FROM RACISM,
APARTHEID AND PRISONS AND INVEST IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU CAN BE A
LEADER IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND TAKE ACTION TOWARD ENDING APART TIED.
ISRAEL IS UNDENIABLY AN APARTHEID STATE. DON'T LET RECKLESS
ACCUSATIONS OF ANTISEMITISM DISTRACT FROM THE REALITY ON THE
GROUND. MILLIONS OF PALESTINIANS FACE BRUTAL VIOLENCE, ETHNIC
CLEANSING, MASSACRES AND DISPOSITION OF THE LAND.
LET ME SAY IT CLEARLY, STANDING UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS NOT
ANTISEMITISM. JEWISH VALUES DEMAND THAT WE DO NOT ABIDE SUCH
JUSTICE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. MARCEL?
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOU WANT TO GO TO DAVID?
>> MARCEL IS UNABLE TO MOVE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO DAVID. I DON'T KNOW IF DAVID IS ON.
>> HI. I'M A STUDENT AT HARVARD AND I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE DURING THE
SCHOOL YEAR. I'M SPEAKING AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109. A FRIEND OF
MINE WAS CALLED THE K WORD WHEN WALKING THROUGH HARVARD YARD
AS A JEW. I'M AGAINST THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE OF THE UNBALANCING OF
THE YOUR STATE WILL MAKE ME FEEL UNSAFE AS A JEW LIVING IN
CAMBRIDGE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DID YOU MUTE YOURSELF BY ACCIDENT?
>> THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS MARCEL.
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD.
>> GOOD EVENING. I'M CHLOE. I'M COMMENTING IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. I'M BORN AND RAISED IN CAMBRIDGE. I HAVE
BEEN HERE MY WHOLE LIFE. I'M MOVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE I
HEARD LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEK AS WELL. RECENTLY IN THE "BOSTON
GLOBE," AN ARTICLE YESTERDAY, ABOUT BEING DISPLACED AND REMOVED
FROM THE HOME. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE.
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID, IT IS CLEAR WHAT IS HAPPENING IS SOMETHING THAT
WE SHOULD RESPOND TO AND THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS DIVEST FROM HP. I

SOLDIERS AND I CONNECTED THAT IN MY HEAD TO COPS ARRESTING YOUNG

>> RENEE, UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> YES. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT SINCE 1978. ACTIVE MEMBER OF
JEWISH VOICE FOR PEACE. AND THE BOSTON WORKER CIRCLE, WHICH IS A
SECTARIAN JEWISH GROUP FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE. I'M IN FAVOR OF POLICY
ORDER 109. IT IS INVESTED IN HP IS INVESTED IN ISRAELI APARTHEID. I
JOURNEY TO ISRAEL AND PALESTINE IN 2015 AND OBSERVED THAT FIRST
HAND. THE OPPRESSIONS THAT THE ISRAELI STATE HOLDS OPPRESSES
PALESTINIANS. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE COUNCIL WEIGH IN WITH
AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT OF HP AT THIS TIME. WE NEED TO HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE...

THE FLOOR. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF. GOING NEXT TO
AMANDA. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HI. I WORK IN AND MOVING BACK TO CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT
BDS AND THE COUNCIL AND ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS. I
BELIEVE THAT CAMBRIDGE SHOULD STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINE
AND END CONTRACTS WITH HP AND OTHER COMPANIES UPHOLDS AND
PROFITING FROM APARTHEID AGAINST PALESTINIANS AND THE HORRORS ICE
PERPETRATES IN THE U.S. CAMBRIDGE IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY
AND WE HAVE EXPAND ON THE LEADERSHIP. JUSTICE DOESN'T HAPPEN, IT
DEMANDS ON ONGOING ACTION. I HOPE WE'LL RESPOND TO PALESTINIAN
CALLS FOR JUSTICE WITH ACTION AND DEDICATION ON BEHALF OF THOSE
WHO FACE THE VIOLENCES OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND COLONIALISM. AS A
JEWISH PERSON, IF FEELS UNFATHOMABLE TO NOT STAND UP IN THE FACE OF
THE SAME ATROCITIES. PLEASE VOTE YES AND TAKE ACTION TO END OUR
COMPLICIT WITH THE AGAIN SIDE AND OCCUPANCY OF PALESTINE. THANK
YOU.
>> NEXT UP, WE HAVE ETHAN. UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. 150 ALBANY STREET AND STUDIED IN
CAMBRIDGE FOR SEVEN YEARS. ISRAELI AMERICAN AND I OPPOSE THE POLICY
ORDER. SUPPORTERS SAY ACCUSATIONS ARE CYNICAL AND OUT OF LINE.
THIS FRIDAY, AS I WALK HOME, A CAR PULLED UP NEXT TO ME AND SHOUTED,
FREE PALESTINE. I WASN'T WAVING A FLAG. I WAS A JEWISH MAN WALKING
HOME ALONE AT NIGHT BEING HARASSED. THAT'S A REASON BDS
SUPPORTERS DON'T HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES. IF THERE IS NO
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TODAY'S CONFLICT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
COUNTRY, THE VICE PRESIDENT, WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SPEAKING OUT.
I CANNOT SAY WHETHER PASSING THE CHARTER RIGHT WILL ENSURE I CAN
SAY IT WILL FAIL TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE. THANK YOU.

I'M FIRM IN MY CONVICTION THAT BDS IS NOT ANTI Semitic.

COMMENT IS THE ABOUT 109 SPECIFICALLY. I LIVED AND WENT TO SCHOOL
AND WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR EIGHT YEARS. I'M A FIRST GENERATION
LEBANESE AMERICAN FROM A FAMILY WHO CAME HERE AS REFUGEES OF THE
LEBANESE CIVIL WAR, IN WHICH ISRAEL CONTRIBUTED VIOLENCE. TOO MANY
PEOPLE ARE PROGRESSIVE EXCEPT FOR PALESTINE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS
HAS MADE ME AND OTHER ARABS, ESPECIALLY PALESTINIAN FEEL
UNWELCOME AND UNSAFE. THIS BLIND SPOT IN CAMBRIDGE IS
DEHUMANIZING AND RACIST. IT IS A COMPLICIT THAT ALLOWS TAX DOLLARS
TO CONTINUE TO ROLL IN AN APARTHEID STATE. I LOVE CAMBRIDGE AND
WANT THE CITY TO PUT THE MONEY WHERE THE PROGRESSIVE MOUTH IS
AND OUT OF THE POCKETS OF HP AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. THANK
YOU.
>> NOAH? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> WHAT?
>> GO AHEAD. WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> THANK YOU. I'M NOAH. I LIVE IN JAMAICA PLAIN AND A RESIDENT OF
BOSTON FOR 12 YEARS. PREVIOUSLY WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR ALMOST
FOUR. AND HERE TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR PROPOSITION 109 TO DIVEST
FROM HP AND ANY COMPANIES COMPLICIT IN APARTHEID. AS A JEWISH
RESIDENT, THE ATROCITIES BEING COMMITTED BY THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT, HAND AND HAND WITH CORPORATIONS LIKE HP, DON'T
REPRESENT ME OR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OR ANYTHING I STAND FOR.
SUPPORTING DIVESTMENT IS NOT SUPPORTING HAMAS. THIS IS
PERFORMING ETHNIC CLEANSING IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST OPEN AIR
PRISON. THEY ALLOW CAMBRIDGE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE INITIATIVE.
CAMBRIDGE IS A PROGRESSIVE WORLD LEADER, USING DIVESTMENT AGAINST
THE APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA. MAKE US PROUD ONCE AGAIN AND LEAD
THE WORLD IN ENDING THE OCCUPATION AND APARTHEID IN PALESTINE.

HEALTH, AND WELL BEING OF PALESTINIANS AND MEMBERS OF THE BLACK

HP AND DIVEST FROM THE COMPANY COMPLICIT AGAINST PALESTINIANS. I
SUPPORT 114, FOR THE HEART PROGRAM TO DEVELOP NONVIOLENT AND
NONINCARCERATIVE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS. CAMBRIDGE IS A LEADER

ARGUMENT THAT IS BROUGHT UP THAT CAMBRIDGE HAS A RELATIONSHIP
WITH A TOY MANUFACTURING CENTER IN CHINA THAT ALLOWS A WIDE
RANGE OF LABOR VIOLATIONS AND BROUGHT UP PARTNERSHIPS WITH
CHINESE COMPANIES THAT ARE INTERN ING WEAKER MUSLIMS. INVESTIGATE
AND TERMINATE CAMBRIDGE'S RELATIONSHIPS THERE, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT
OPPONENTS OF POLICY ORDER 109 ARE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AT THE MOMENT AN ATTEMPT TO SILENCE
ADVOCACY. SUPPORT 109 AND 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE AS A STUDENT. I SPEAK AGAINST THE POLICY
ORDER. I OPPOSE THE ATTEMPT TO PASS ANY RESOLUTION BECAUSE THIS IS
A WAY TO POLICE BLAME ON THE SPECIFIC ACTOR. IT IS PLACING ON THE
WRONG ONE. HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. BY DIRECTLY
PUNISHING ISRAEL, THE TERROR IS NOT REDUCED AND PEACE WILL NOT BE
ACHIEVED. THIS POLICY ORDER ALSO DIRECTLY PROMOTES DISCRIMINATION
AND HATE. ISRAEL IS THE DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST EXERCISING CIVIL
RIGHTS UPON ALL PEOPLE, HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
ANTISemitic, ANTI WOMEN RIGHTS AND DIDN'T RESPECT FREEDOM OF
SPEECH OR RELIGION. I BELIEVE THIS RESOLUTION IS SEEKING TO NEGATIVELY
AFFECT THE DEMOCRACY THAT PRIORITIZES EQUALITY AND INCLUSION AND
USES THE MONEY AND RESOURCES FOR MEDICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES THAT THE WHOLE WORLD BENEFITS FROM. TO PASS THIS
RESOLUTION, IT WOULD BE TO FALSELY AFFIRM THE CONTRARY. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NINA?
>> I'M READING ON BEHALF OF NINA. I ASK YOU TO VOTE FOR THE POLICY
ORDERS. I WILL FOCUS ON 109. HP PROFITS FROM THE SURVEILLANCE AND
OPPRESSION OF PALESTINIANS AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY IS MAKING A BASIC
REQUEST THAT WE BOYCOTT THEM. I'M JEWISH AND A MEMBER OF THE
BOSTON WORKER CIRCLE. IT IS MY JEWISH IDENTIFY WILL THAT INFORM MY
SUPPORT FOR BDS. MY BATHROOM WHO LOST FAMILY IN THE HOLOCAUST
WAS A SOCIALIST AND INTERNATIONALIST AND SKEPTICAL OF ISRAEL.
FOR THIS REASON, I THROW MY SUPPORT BEHIND THE MOVEMENT OF
LIBERATION AND BEHIND THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES. BDS IS NOT
ABOUT SINGLE ISSUE. IT IS A CALL TO ACTION. TO NEGLECT THAT IS A
POLITICAL AND MORAL FAILURE. ON THE TOPIC, I SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF
DEFUNDING THE POLICE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. FOR ME, THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS
DOWN. CAN YOU TAKE OVER FOR A LITTLE BIT?

>> YES. I'M AN MIT GRADUATE STUDENTS. I SUPPORT THE ORDERS AND I
BELIEVE IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY. I WANT TO TAKE MY MINUTE TO
DISMANTLE A NUMBER OF UNFOUNDED CLAIMS BEING MADE. ISRAEL IS NOT
A DEMOCRATIC STATE. 500 OVER THE LAST 48 HOURS PARTAKING IN
RECENT DEMONSTRATIONS IS NOT A DEMOCRACY. ARAB ISRAELIS ARE
SECOND AND THIRD CLASS CITIZENS THAT DON'T ENJOY ALL RIGHTS. HP
SERVERS POWER THIS TIERED SYSTEM AND
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
ISRAELI IS NOT BEING SINGLED OUT. THERE ARE SANCTIONS PLACED ON
COUNTRIES FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS INFRACTIONS. THIS IS NOT ON ISRAEL.
IT IS ON HP AND A BOYCOTT OF POLAROID WAS DONE IN THE PAST. ANTI
ZIONISM IS NOT ANTISEMITISM. THERE ARE JEWS SUPPORTING THE
PROTECTION OF PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. AND CAMBRIDGE WOULDN'T BE THE
FIRST CITY TO CUT TIES WITH HP. FOLLOW EXAMPLES AND UPHOLD THE
CAMBRIDGE VALUES VERY MUCH TO DO WITH CAMBRIDGE AND MAKE A
COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION.
>> THANK YOU. NEXT, WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. I'M PALESTINIAN. I DON'T LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE, BUT I WORKED
THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND I WILL SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS.
I SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS NOT SLEEPING, NOT EATING, AND CALLING MY
FAMILY EVERY HOUR TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALIVE. AND I SAY THIS
BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT SUPPORTING BDS WILL
MAKE THEM FEEL UNSAFE OR UNCOMFORTABLE. IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE
WHEN PEOPLE'S RACISM AND PRIVILEGE IS IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE.
PALESTINIANS IT IS ABOUT A LACK OF PHYSICAL SAFETY THAT CAN BE
MEASURED IN DEATHS, INJURIES, REFUGEES, LOSS OF HOMELAND, WORK
AND INCARCERATION. IF CAMBRIDGE CONTINUES TO PURCHASE WITH HP,
THEY WILL SUPPORT AND CONTRIBUTING TO THAT. I HAVE NOT SEEN MY
FAMILY IN PALESTINE SINCE I WAS NINE AND I HAVE TRIED. I HAVE BEEN
TURNED AWAY AT THE BORDER BECAUSE I'M PALESTINIAN AND IN
CAMBRIDGE, WHILE ZIONISTS HAVE FEARS, MY FEARS ABOUT SAFETY HAVE
BEEN TOO REAL AND HAVING MY CLASSMATES ASK ME IF MY FAMILY ARE
TERRORISTS AND HAVING BEEN SUBJECTED TO ANTIPALESTINIAN RACISM.
BOYCOTT THE APARTHEID STATE OF ISRAEL AND STOP SUPPORTING AND
PURCHASING FROM HP.
>> THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE DALIA.
>> I DON'T THINK DALIA IS HERE. I DON'T THINK SAM OR TAL.
>> NEXT UP IS BENJAMIN FISHER. GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE TO UNMUTE
YOURSELF. NEXT PERSON, GO AHEAD.
>> HI. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDERS. I WANT TO TAKE MY TIME TO
RESPOND TO A FEW SPEAKERS WHO CITED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
ELSEWHERE AS THE REASON TO NOT BOYCOTT HP. BECAUSE THERE'S
OPPRESSION IN SYRIA AND CHINA, WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT ISRAEL'S CRIMES.
TO THAT, I SAY THIS, I LIVED HERE FOR OVER A DECADE AND KNOW A LOT OF


PAGE 66

May 24, 2021

PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN TODAY. I HAVE MET SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND
ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE HERE TODAY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE
BOYCOTTING HP FOR COMPLICIT IN ETHICALLY CLEANSING. IT IS DISGUSTING
THAT PEOPLE ARE USING CHINA AS TO SUPPORT THE ISRAELI I HAVE NEVER
SEEN THESE PEOPLE AT THE EVENTS. STAND IN SOLIDARITY, AT THE SAME
TIME, AND THAT WILL BEGIN WITH SUPPORTING THE POLICY ORDER TODAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IT IS QUINN NEXT?
>> GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HELLO. I LIVE HERE ON MEMORIAL DRIVE AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDER 109. AND TO THE PEOPLE IN THE ZOOM SAYING ARAB HAVE
HIGH POSITION OF POWER SO NO APART TIED. BOTH PARTIES OPPOSE BDS
BECAUSE AMERICA IS FOUNDED ON THE SAME RACIST.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
THIS IS IRONIC GIVEN THEY MARKET THEMSELVES AS A GAY FRIENDLY
COUNTRY. THE LEGAL STATUS OF A JEWISH CITIZEN BORN IN ISRAEL IS
SECURE WHILE PALESTINIAN RESIDENTS IS NOT. IT IS A REVOCABLE STATUS
AND UNLIKELY TO GET CITIZENSHIP. A JEWISH CITIZEN CAN MOVE ABROAD
AND COME BACK, PALESTINIAN STATUS IS LIKELY TO BE REVOKED. REFUGEES
IN LEBANON CAN'T VISIT ISRAEL AND CAN'T MOVE THERE AND BECOME A
CITIZEN. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THEY CAN'T DRIVE ON THE SAME ROADS.
SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER, PLEASE.
>> NEXT WE HEAR FROM ALEGRA.
>> HELLO. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. AND OPPOSE BDS AND OPPOSE THIS
ORDER. IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL UNSAFE TO THE LIVE IN THE CITY THAT
SINGLE OUT ISRAEL AND I HOPE CAMBRIDGE DOESN'T TAKE THE COURSE OF
ACTION.
>> NEXT UP, WE HEAR FROM HAROLD. UNMUTE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE THE
FLOOR. UNMUTE YOURSELF. MAYBE HAVING TECHNICAL ISSUES. WE'LL
MOVE TO JAMIE.
>> HELLO. I'M HERE TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER
109 AND 114. I WILL FOCUS ON 109. MANY SPEAKERS BEFORE ME HAVE
ARGUED THAT OPPOSITION TO ZIONISM IS ANTISemitic. THIS IS A
CONFLATION USED TO DISTRACT FROM THE FACT THAT ZION IDEOLOGY THAT
ARE IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT SUPPRESS PALESTINIANS. WITHOUT
QUESTION, JEWISH PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING ISRAELI, DESERVE TO
LIVE IN PEACE AND TO HAVE THE COLLECTIVE HISTORY AND CURRENT REALITY
OF ANTISEMITISM ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADDRESSED. AND ANY SEMITISM
NEEDS TO BE CONDEMNED. CRITICALLY, PALESTINIANS HAVE A FORM OF
SOLIDARITY IN THE COLLECTIVE STRUGGLE. VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER
NUMBER 109.
>> NEXT WE HAVE JULIENNE.
>> HELLO. I'M READING TESTIMONY. WE LIVE AT 217 CAMBRIDGE STREET
AND HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS, AGES TEN AND 13. WE TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF


PAGE 67

May 24, 2021

THE POLICY ORDERS. WE CHOOSE TO MAKE CAMBRIDGE OUR HOME
BECAUSE MOTIVATED BY THE CITY'S LONG HISTORY ON SOCIAL JUSTICE
ISSUES. EFFORTS TO FIGHT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID. THE
COUNCIL TOOK A STAND ON MIT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN
YEMEN. WE ASK YOU TO ACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD BY PASSING POLICY
ORDER 109. THE CITY SHOULD END ALL PURCHASE FROM HP USING THE
TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE CAN END OUR ECONOMIC COMPLICIT IN ISRAELI
VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION AGAIN PALESTINIANS. HP IS THE PROVIDER OF
THE SERVERS ISRAEL WILL DEPEND ON TO RUN THE POPULATION REGISTRY
AND THE PROVIDER FOR THE PERSONAL COMPUTERS TO THE MILITARY. WE
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER.
>> NEXT WE HAVE SAM.
>> HI. I'M SAM. I STRONGLY OPPOSE POLICY ORDERS 109. CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENT AND GRANDCHILD OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. BDS IS NOT A
PEACEFUL MOVEMENT IT IS DECEPTIVE. IT IS REJECTED FROM JOE BIDEN,
PRESIDENT OBAMA, JOE KENNEDY, ET CETERA. I FEEL THIS MOTION WILL
TARNISH CAMBRIDGE REPUTATION AS PROGRESSIVE CITY. PERSONALLY WE'D
FEEL UNSAFE AND CONSIDER LEAVING. I HOPE WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO
PROPOSE SOLUTIONS TO THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. PLEASE REJECT THE POLICY
ORDER. THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON. UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HI. I LIVE IN SOMERVILLE AND A PH.D. STUDENT AT MIT. I'M HERE TO
VOICE THE STRONG OPPOSITION TO RESOLUTION 109 AND 114. FIRST, THIS
BILL PRESENTS A ONE SIDED VIEW THAT DEMONIZED ISRAEL. CAMBRIDGE IS
OPEN TO ALL BACKGROUNDS AND I FEEL THIS IS THE STEP TO SHUT OUT AN
ENTIRE COUNTRY. I WANT TO SHARE A HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE
CONFLICT BETWEEN GAZA AND ISRAEL. MY PARENTS AND BROTHER LIVE IN
ISRAEL AND SPENT THE FIRST PART OF MAY LISTENING FOR SIRENS AND
GOING INTO BOMB SHELTERS. MY BROTHER, COLLEGE SENIOR, MOVED WITH
MY PARENTS SINCE THE CITY WAS UNDER ATTACK. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO
WATCH LAST WEEK'S VIDEO AND HEAR COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN ARGUE
AGAINST EXTENDING THE VOTE AND
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PLEASE DO NOT MENTION DIRECT ALL COMMENTS TO
THE CHAIR.
>> THANK YOU. I'M SORRY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GO AHEAD.
>> FOR SURE. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I URGE THAT OUR COUNCIL ENCOURAGE
BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE. I WAS DISAPPOINTED
THAT LAST WEEK IT SEEMED LIKE IT WASN'T WHAT WAS BEING SAID IN THE
COUNCIL. I'M HAPPY BOTH SIDES ARE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: PUBLIC COMMENT IS DOWN. YOU HAVE TO TAKE OVER
FOR A BIT WHILE THEY FIX IT.

>> YUP. NEXT, WE SHOULD HAVE SHARON.
>> HI. I'M SHARON. MY HUSBAND AND ARE FORMER CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS AND LIVE IN WATERTOWN OVER THE BORDER. I'M HUSBAND HAS
AN OFFICE IN CAMBRIDGE AND WE FREQUENT CAMBRIDGE RESTAURANTS
AND BUSINESSES. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER.
LET'S BE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT ABOUT FIGHTING RACISM. ALONG WITH THE
OBJECTIVES AND THE MOVEMENT, THIS RESOLUTION SINGLES OUT ISRAEL
AND PERPETUATES A FALSE NARRATIVE ABOUT THE ONLY JEWISH STATE IN
THE WORLD. PASSING THIS IS IT SERVE TO DELEGITIMIZE ISRAEL AND
TARGET JEWISH RESIDENTS, WORKERS, AND VISITORS. WHY IS THE COUNCIL
TARGETING ONLY HP. AND WHAT WILL THE ECONOMIC FEATURE OF
CAMBRIDGE LOOK LIKE IF IT THE REPUTATION IS TARNISHED BY A ONE SIDED
APPROACH. I WILL CERTAINLY NO LONGER FEEL WELCOME OR SAFE IN THE
CITY. AND BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS IS A COMMONWEALTH, THE CITY ACT
AS COMMUNITIES, I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE
>> THANK YOU. THAT IS THE TIME. NEXT, WE HEAR FROM NOAH. IF YOU
CAN UNMUTE YOURSELF, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. GO AHEAD. ONE MORE
TIME. WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
>> HI. THANK YOU. I LIVED ON RAYMOND STREET IN CAMBRIDGE SINCE I
WAS A BABY. THIS COMMUNITY MEANS A LOT TO ME. THANK YOU FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK...
BDS OPPOSE THE SELF DETERMINATION FOR THE JEWISH PEOPLE. A STANCE
TAKEN UP WHEN THEY FEEL UNWELCOME. PALESTINIAN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN
RIGHTS. THIS ORDER DOESN'T HELP PEACE BUILDING EFFORTS. PLEASE VOTE
NO ON 109 AND YES ON 114. KEEP CAMBRIDGE WELCOMING AND SAFE
COMMUNITY FOR ALL.
>> NEXT, WE HAVE STEPHANIE.
>> GOOD EVENING. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF STAND WITH US NEW ENGLAND.
I WORK WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO TO
POLICY ORDER 109. A TIME OF RISING ANTISEMITISM, IT WILL HARM
STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE ORDER IS TO
PROMOTE THE BDS MOVEMENT AGAINST ISRAEL. THIS DEMONIZING,
DEHUMANIZING AND ISOLATES ISRAELIS AND JEWS GLOBALLY AND WILL ADD
FUEL TO THE FIRE AT A DANGEROUS TIME FOR ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS.
BDS CO FOUNDER IS QUOTED EARLIER TO SUPPORT THE 109. MAYBE
INTERESTED TO KNOW, IT WAS SAID HIS MOVEMENT IT OPPOSE THE
EXISTENCE OF A JEWISH STATE, WANTS TO TURN ISRAEL INTO A PARIAH AND
SUPPORTS A SOLUTION IN WHICH JEWS ARE A MINORITY AGAIN. THINK
ABOUT IF DENYING JEWISH PEOPLE RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINATION IS A
CAUSE YOU WANT TO SUPPORT. PLEASE VOTE NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON. GOING BACK TO HAROLD.
>> HI. CAN YOU HEAR ME? THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR TAKING ALL
THIS TIME. I KNOW IT IS LATE IN THE EVENING. I WILL BE BRIEF. I HAVE BEEN
PRACTICING MEDICINE IN CAMBRIDGE FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS. HOME

May 24, 2021

OWNER FOR PAST 40 YEARS. I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES AT THE AGE OF
NINE AS A REFUGEE. MY FATHER AND PARENTS WE WERE OUT BECAUSE
JEWS WERE LABELLED ZIONIST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. NO DOUBT IN MY
MIND THAT BDS IS ANTISemitic. I OPPOSE IT. I WON'T FEEL SAFE IN
CAMBRIDGE IF YOU GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT THIS BDS ACTION. IT IS A
DOUBLE STANDARD. LET'S FACE IT. AS MY MOM SAID, THE JEWS SUPPORT IT
THERE WERE JEWS WHO SUPPORTED IT IN HAD THE LARGE GHETTOS. THANK
YOU.
>> NEXT IS HALEY.
>> THANK YOU. MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE ON HANCOCK STREET AND I
APPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. I HAVE FELT ACCEPTED AND SAFE IN
CAMBRIDGE. THE FIRST TIME I FELT UNWELCOME IS WHEN FINDING OUT THE
INITIAL PLAN IS TO VOTE ON THE POLICY ORDER WHEN I AND SO MANY OF MY
RESIDENTS ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND DUE TO THE CONFLICT WITH THE JEWISH
HOLIDAY. I'M THANKFUL IT WAS POSTPONED SO CAN I BE HERE THAT BDS
ORDERS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY GOVERNORS FROM ALL 50 STATES.
PASSING IT HERE WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT WILL HARM
CAMBRIDGE AS AN ACCEPTING COMMUNITY. ALSO, WE HAVE TO ASK WHY
THIS ORDER IS BEING BROUGHT NOW. WHEN CAMBRIDGE HAS NOT HAD ANY
DIRECT CONTRACT WITH HP SINCE 2014. I BELIEVE IT IS A CLEAR ATTEMPT AT
DEMONIZE ISRAEL AT A TIME WHEN THEY DEFEND FROM HAMAS, A GROUP
THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZE AS TERRORIST. AGAIN, I
URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ELIZA.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I'M REPRESENTING STAND
WITH US NEW ENGLAND. I'M SPEAKING AGAINST THE POLICY. I WORK WITH
COLLEGE STUDENTS IN NEW ENGLAND, INCLUDING HARVARD AND MIT,
STUDENTS ARE USUALLY PROUD TO BE JEWISH. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE RISE
GLOBALLY OF ANTISEMITISM OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS, THERE IS A SHIFT
IN THAT MENTALITY. ONE STUDENT SAID SHE TOOK OFF HER STAR DAVID
NECKLACE BECAUSE SHE FEELS UNSAFE. ANOTHER STUDENT HAD TO
CONTACT UNIVERSITY POLICE DUE TO GRAFFITI ON HIS DORM REDUCE, JEWS
ARE BABY KILLERS. SHOULD POLICY 109 PASS, MY STUDENTS IN CAMBRIDGE
AND BEYOND WILL NOT FEEL SAFE. PLEASE DO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.
ADDITIONALLY, BLAMING ISRAEL FOR POLICE BRUTALITY IN AMERICA IS AN
ANTISemitic CONSPIRACY THEORY AND SHAMEFUL HOW MANY IT IS
PROMOTED TODAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REBECCA?
>> HI, I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT ON CLINTON STREET WITH MY SPOUSE.
I'M A DOCTORAL STUDENT. I'M SPEAKING TO OPPOSE THE RESOLUTION 109,
PROMOTES THE SLANDERING NOTION THAT ISRAEL IS AN APARTHEID STATE.
IT IS NOT TRUE. I FEEL LIKE IT SINGLES OUT ISRAELI AND HOLDS TO AN
UNREASONABLE THIS RESOLUTION HOPES TO CAST THIS AS A SIMPLE ISSUE
OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL INSTEAD OF PROMOTING HONEST, HARD AND
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN LEAD TO PEACE. INCREASED PEACE


PAGE 70

May 24, 2021

BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINIAN IS CLOSE TO MY HEART, I FEAR THIS IS
NOT A PRODUCTIVE WAY TO REACH THAT AND BY CASTING THIS AS A ONE
SIDED, UNCOMPLICATED ISSUE, YOU WILL EVERYONE IS TO MAKE YOUR
RESIDENTS, JEWISH RESIDENTS LIKE MYSELF AND ISRAELI RESIDENTS TO FEEL
MARGINALIZED, UNWELCOME, UNSAFE, INTELLECTUALLY AND PHYSICALLY IN
CAMBRIDGE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KATHY?
>> HI. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY
ORDER 109 AND 114. THE ORDER THE ARE RELATED BECAUSE BOTH SEEK TO
ADDRESS AN UNEQUAL POWER DYNAMIC AND SUFFERING. THE CRUELTY OF
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SHOCKING. IT IS TARGETED MEDICAL
AND HUMANITARIAN SIGHTS IN THE BOMBING. THERE IS ONE NEUROLOGIST,
THE ARMY BOMBED THE HOME, KILLED THE DOCTOR, THE WIFE AND
CHILDREN. THIS IS A HUMANITARIAN WHO CARED FOR PATIENTS AND HE IS
DEAD FOR NO REASON. AND PEOPLE IN CAMBRIDGE SAY THEY FEEL UNSAFE.
THE HEART PROPOSAL IS DEVELOPED BY BLACK AND BROWN AND LOW
INCOME RESIDENT WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THE RACIST AND
INEQUITABLE SYSTEM OF POLICING. THEY SEEK TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES
TO POLICING USING COMMUNITY BASED EMPLOYMENT AND LEADERSHIP.
SUPPORT AND FUND THE HEART PROGRAM. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SARAH AND THEN ANDREW.
>> THANK YOU. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR FIVE
YEARS. I'M FIRMLY AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER 109. ONE SIDED BDS
NARRATIVE UNDERMINE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE. CAMBRIDGE HAS NO
CONTRACTS WITH HP AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THE TIME HAS BEEN SPENT ON
THIS ISSUE. PLEASE VOTE AGAINST THE POLICY ORDER.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANDREW AND THEN MARY.
>> OKAY. SORRY. I'M ANDREW. ESSEX STREET. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF
114 TO FUND AND IMPLEMENT THE HEART ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC SAFETY
PROPOSAL AND POLICY ORDER 109, DIVEST FROM HP, WHICH PLAYS A
SINISTER ROLE IN THE APARTHEID. THE WAR ON AN OCCUPATION OF
PALESTINIANS ABROAD IS A WAR ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AT
HOME. THE BOMBS DROPPING ON OUR PALESTINIAN FAMILIES IN GAZA
MIRROR THE BULLETS COMING DOWN ON OUR BLACK AND BROWN SISTERS
AND BROTHERS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
PARTY IS A BOLD INNOVATIVE PROGRAM. THE BLACK RESPONSE MOVEMENT
HAS PUT FORTH A TRANSFORMATIONAL ALTERNATIVE WITH A COMPASSION
CARE FOR THE FELLOW NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED AND
DISENFRANCHISED FOR A MODEL OF HEALING AND COMPASSION
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. MARY.
>> HELLO. I'M MARY. I LIVED AND WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 45 YEARS
AND RAISED MY THREE CHILDREN HERE. I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE POLICY
ORDER 109. THIS RESOLUTION WILL NOT BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF
CAMBRIDGE, BUT ONLY AS YOU CAN SEE AS ALREADY STIRRED UP PUBLIC


PAGE 71

May 24, 2021

CONTROVERSY, DIVISIVENESS, HATRED AND ANTISEMITISM IN OUR CITY. IT IS
AN ATTEMPT BY THE BDS MOVEMENT TO CO OP THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR
THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA TO DELEGITIMIZE THE STATE OF ISRAEL. BDS
IS AGAINST THE TWO STATE SOLUTION THE FOUNDERS HAVE THE GOAL TO
WIPE OUT THE STATE OF ISRAEL. ISRAEL IS NOT AN APARTHEID STATE AND
THE ANALOGY OF COMPARING IT TO SOUTH AFRICA IS WRONG. I URGE YOU
TO VOTE NO ON THE RESOLUTION. PLEASE DON'T PERMIT THIS MOVEMENT
TO USE OUR CITY'S REPUTATION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JOE?
>> I'M JOE. LIVE ON HARVARD STREET. DIVISIVENESS OF THE POLICY ORDER
IS APPARENT. THIS IS MORAL FOSTERING. IT WON'T HELP A PALESTINIAN. IT
IS CLEAR THE CITY IS NOT UNIFIED AND I CAN'T SEE HOW THE COUNCIL CAN
CLAIM IT IS. MY SENSE, I'M OUTNUMBERED AMONG THE SPEAKERS, IT IS NOT
ALWAYS TRUE FOR A PERCENT PERSECUTED. I LOOK AT THE KALEIDOSCOPE
OF THE NEIGHBORS AND REPRESENTATIVES THAT BELIEVE THEIR CONSCIENCE
OUTWEIGHS MY SAFETY. OBSERVANT JEWS ARE DENIED THE PRIVILEGE OF
SPEAKING LAST WEEK. I SHARE YOUR HORROR I'M ASKING YOU TO DO
WHAT IS HARD, BUT RIGHT AND STAND WITH THE PEOPLE HERE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LILLY?
>> YES. HELLO? I OPPOSE THE POLICY OF 109. I BORN I BOTH MY PARENTS
HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND I GREW UP IN ISRAEL. AND I SERVED IN ISRAEL
ARMY, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I WILL SAY ISRAELI IS THE MOST
(INAUDIBLE) I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES TO RAISE MY CHILDREN. I
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A VERY SAFE PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY, I'M
REALLY AFRAID FOR THEIR SAFETY. IT REMIND ME WHAT WE SUFFER IN THE
COMMUNISM. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU SEE JUST ONE SIDE. I HOPE YOU SEE
THIS SECOND SIDE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TAL?
>> HI. I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING I'M AN ISRAELI AMERICAN WHO WANTS
NOTHING MORE THAN TO PEACEFULLY CO EXIST WITH MY PALESTINIAN
NEIGHBORS. THE JEWS HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO CO EXIST WITH THE ARAB
NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE JEWS HAVE BEEN MET WITH NOTHING BUT
VIOLENCE AND RESISTANCE. WE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO EXIST
PEACEFULLY, NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE NEXT
GENERATIONS. AND RIGHT NOW, WE ARE THREATENING THE FUTURE OF THE
NEXT GENERATIONS BY PROPOSING A DECISIVE DISCRIMINATORY POLICY
ORDER THAT SILENCE THE PEACEFUL VOICES THAT WANT TO CO EXIST. I
CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC STATE IN THE MIDDLE
EAST, WHICH IS PROUDLY THE ONLY HOME IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE
JEWISH ARAB CHRISTIANS OF ALL NATIONAL, GENDER, AND SEXUAL
IDENTITIES, CAN BE THE TARGET OF HATE FOR TRYING TO EXIST. THIS IS
THREATENED LONG WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANDY IS NEXT.
>> THANK YOU. JEWISH CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE


PAGE 72

May 24, 2021

PO 109 AND 114. I SUPPORT CAMBRIDGE ENDING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH
HP, ONE OF THE CORPORATIONS THAT ADVANCES OPPRESSION BY
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SURVEILLANCE, SORTING, AND
TRACKING OF HUMAN BEINGS BASED ON THE RELIGION, NATIONALITY OR
IMMIGRATION STATUS. HP 'S ROLE IS CENTRAL TO MAINTAINING SYSTEMS
THAT CLASSIFY AND MONITOR THE POPULATIONS IN ISRAEL AND HERE. THE
PROPOSAL IS NOT ABOUT ANTISEMITISM, RATHER THAN BEING THE
COUNCIL SHOULD LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL ON THE MERITS AND BUILD ON
THE LEGACY OF CAMBRIDGE. AND I SUPPORT THE CAMBRIDGE HEART
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS A CONSTRUCTIVE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM
THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED.
>> THANK YOU. THERE IS A REASON THAT THE TWO POLICIES ARE
PRESENTED TOGETHER. THEY ARE TRYING TO BE SOLUTIONS TO THE LARGEST
PROBLEM OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND COLONIZATION. WE HAVE HEARD
FROM COLONIZER WHO ARE FLABBERGASTED AT THE MENTION OF
LIBERATION AND FREEDOM FOR OPPRESSED PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT A
RELIGIOUS ISSUE, NOT A COMPLICATED ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF HUMAN
RIGHTS. HUMAN AND ANTI COLONIZATION, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL
HAVE TO BE FOR IN SUPPORT. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE SILENT. IT IS NOT
ENOUGH TO SAY IT IS TOO COMPLICATED AND SIT BY WHILE CHILDREN BEING
MURDERED. NO COLONIAL EMPIRE NEEDS TO STAND AND ONE DAY
PALESTINE WILL BE FREE AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO JARED.
>> HI. I GROUP IN CAMBRIDGE AND LIVED HERE MOST OF MY LIFE. I LIVE IN
SOMERVILLE AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER, WHICH IS
CREATING PROBLEMS WITHOUT SOLVING ANY. I SUPPORT PALESTINIAN
RIGHTS JUST AS I SUPPORT ISRAELI AND JEWISH RIGHTS TO SELF
DETERMINATION AND SUPPORT A PEACEFUL TWO STATE SOLUTION, WHICH
BDS DOESN'T. THIS IS NOT ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND NOT A
PRINCIPLE REVIEW OF CITY CONTRACTS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH A
DISCRIMINATION POLICY. THIS RESOLUTION IS CLEARLY JUST A POLITICAL
STUNT INTENDED TO TARGET ONE PARTY, ISRAEL AND ISRAELIS AT A TIME
WHEN THEY ARE VULNERABLE AND IN CRISIS. THAT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
AND DOES NOTHING TO HELP THE PALESTINIANS. THE RHETORIC IS
UNFOUNDED, IT IS DIVISIVE, AND REALLY A BAD WAY TO CONDUCT PUBLIC
POLICY. CAMBRIDGE HAS BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO WITH TIME
AND RESOURCE. I URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS PROPOSAL.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MAYA?
>> HI. I'M MAYA. STUDENT AT LESLEY UNIVERSITY. I'M HERE TO STRONGLY
SUPPORT POLICY ORDERS. I SERVED IN THE WEST BANK FOR ABOUT EIGHT
MONTHS AND WITNESS THE DAILY VIOLENCE THAT IS ENACTED ON THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, WE HAD A detention CENTER
ON MY BASE AND HAD YOUNG BOYS AS YOUNG AS SEVEN OR EIGHT, THEY
WALK INTO THE BASE WITH THE HANDS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK AND THE
EYES BLINDFOLDED WHICH IS ILLEGAL. AND TO THIS I SAY NOT IN MY NAME.
WE MUST END THE VIOLENT OCCUPATION AND SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT

PAGE 73

May 24, 2021

FOR LIBERATION EVERYWHERE. RIGHT NOW, ISRAELI POLICE ARE LAUNCHING
A WAVE OF ARRESTS, TARGETS PALESTINIANS WHO RALLIED IN SUPPORT...
ISRAEL WILL CONTINUE TO DISPOSSESS MURDER AND
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. IS JASMINE HERE? NO.
>> NEXT I SEE ANNABEL.
>> HI. I LIVED AND WORKED IN CAMBRIDGE AND I TESTIFY TO STRONGLY
SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS. STANDING AGAINST STATE SANCTIONED
VIOLENCE IS AT THE CORE OF MY JEWISH VALUES. THE FACT HERE MANY
CONFLATED ISRAEL WITH JUDAISM AND FUELS ANTISEMITISM AGAINST US.
MOST OF THOSE OFFERING TESTIMONY AGAINST IT FEEL THEY WILL BE SAFE
IF ISRAEL IS SUPPORTED IS A KIN TO SOMEONE INSISTING THEY ARE ONLY
SAFE UNDER WHITE SUPREMACY. HP TECHNOLOGY USED TO TRACK
BIOMETRIC DATA AND MAINTAIN TIERED CITIZEN AND APARTHEID. MY
ISRAELI FAMILY AND OTHER JEWS ARE SUBJECT TO GHETTO, CULTURAL
THEFT, MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND STOLEN CHILDREN.
THE EXISTENCE OF ISRAEL IS NOT MAKING ANY JEWS SAFE. REFUGEE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON IS ANDREW. DO YOU HAVE
THAT?
>> YOU ARE UNMUTED GO AHEAD. GO TO NEXT PERSON.
>> ARE YOU WAITING FOR ME. SORRY. HELLO. I'M ANDREW. I LIVE IN
CAMBRIDGE. I WORK AT THE PH.D. RESEARCHER AT HARVARD AND SERVE ON
THE GRADUATE STUDENT UNION EXECUTIVE BOARD HERE IN CAMBRIDGE.
MY COMMENTS REPRESENT MY VIEW. I SUPPORT THE DETERMINATION OF
CAMBRIDGE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH HP AND ASK YOU TO VOTE YES
ON PO 109. ONE CITY, TAKING AN EARLY STEP CAN HAVE AN IMPORTANT
LONG TERM IMPACT AND SHOWING WHAT IS POSSIBLE. AS SOMEONE RAISED
IN A JEWISH FAMILY AND THE GRANDSON OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS, I'M
DISAPPOINTED BY OPPOSING THE ACTION TO AT THIS TIME ISRAELI STATE IS
SOMEONE ANTISemitic. MANY JEWS IN THE WORLD REJECT THAT CYNICAL
CONNECTION WHEN THE COUNCIL SHOULD TOO. THE HORRIFYING PICTURES
OF THE BATTERING OF GAZA IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS IS THE MOST RECENT
CHAPTER IN A DECADE LONG SAGA OF SUFFERING CAUSED BY THE
OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIAN AND THEIR LAND. CONTINUING TO SUPPORT A
COMPANY THAT IS A KEY PROVIDER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COMPETING
INFRASTRUCTURE, WILL ENABLE THE ATROCITIES TO CONTINUE. THAT'S WHY
YOU MUST END THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HP IN ADDITION TO OTHER
COMPANIES WORKING IN RELATED CAPACITIES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO IS IT ROBERT? IT IS UNDER BOB. GO
AHEAD.
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> I'M BOB. A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER 109.
THE SITUATION IN ISRAEL AND THE TERRITORY IS COMPLEX, IT DEFIED
RESOLUTION FOR 70 YEARS. TO MAKE A BOYCOTT OF HP, A COMPANY WHICH


PAGE 74

May 24, 2021

IT HAS NOT DONE BUSINESS OVER FIVE YEARS, TO PUNISH ONE SIDE OF THIS
QUAGMIRE... YOU ARE CORRECT IN STATING THAT THE KILLING OF CHILDREN
IS A STATE SPONSORED VIOLENCE. HOWEVER, THE PERPETRATORS ARE
HAMAS, USE THE CHILDREN AS SHIELD TO GAIN SYMPATHY FOR THOSE LIKE
YOURSELF WHO ARE WELL INTENTIONED. APARTHEID IS THE BIG LIE.
REPEATED ENOUGH DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE. WE KNOW ABOUT BIG LIES IN
CAMBRIDGE. PLEASE VOTE AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109 AND YES ON 114.
THANK YOU.
>> A STUDENT WORKER AT HARVARD. AM A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, I'M
HERE SPEAKING AS A DUAL UNITED STATES CITIZEN, URGING THE SUPPORT OF
109. ISRAEL GAVE ME A PLACE TO ESCAPE NOTHING ANTISemitic ABOUT
BOYCOTTING. IT IS U.S. POLICY THAT DOES JUST THAT. WE GIVE MILITARY
AID PER CAPITA TO ISRAEL. THEY USE IT FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINE.
IT IS AFTER U.S. WITHDRAW SUPPORT FROM SOUTH AFRICAN REGIME THAT
THE POWER SHIFTED.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP. WE HAVE PAUL.
>> THANK YOU. I'M PAUL SHANNON. I WORK FOR 40 YEARS AT THE
AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE OF NEW ENGLAND ON
MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE IN CAMBRIDGE. TONIGHT I'M SPEAKING FOR THE
AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE. AND ASKING THIS COUNCIL TO
VOTE YES ON POLICY ORDER 109 AND TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASING OF HP
EQUIPMENT. THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH
REPORT THAT ISRAEL IS AN APARTHEID STATE. THAT DETERMINATION
SHOULD BE BASED ON ISRAELI LAWS, POLICIES, AND THE COMPARISON WITH
INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE INSISTS
THAT IT IS LONG PASS TIME THAT THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO STRIKE
ANOTHER BLOW AGAINST APARTHEID BY VOTE AGO
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HI. I HAVE LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE SINCE 2019. I'M AGAINST POLICY
ORDERS FOR SAMPLE AND OBVIOUS REASONS. THEY POLITICIZE JUST
MINORITY GROUPS. A JEWISH WOMAN OF COLOR, I UNDERSTAND WHY
MINORITY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT. WE CAN'T BE HYPOCRITE AND TALK
ABOUT PEACE WHILE THE JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS LIVE IN FEAR. WE
SHOULDN'T SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION THAT RELIES ON THE FOUNDER
OPINION AND THE STRONG DESIRES TO ELIMINATE THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
THAT IS NOT PEACE. WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION THAT
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT TWO STATE SOLUTION OR PEACE AMONG ISRAELI AND
PALESTINIAN. WITHOUT A DOUBT, I WILL NOT SUPPORT AN ORGANIZATION
THAT PROMOTES FEAR AND DISCRIMINATION AND AS THE DISTURBING OF
THE NAZI PROPAGANDA WAS USED AGAINST JEWS DURING WORLD WAR LL,
CAMBRIDGE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO TREAT ALL EQUALLY. NOT JUST
PALESTINIAN GROUPS. THANK YOU.
>> IF WE CAN ASK YOU UPDATE YOUR VERSION OF ZOOM AND RETURN TO
THE CALL. WE'LL CALL ON YOU WHEN YOU ARE BACK.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THOMAS NEXT?
>> GO AHEAD.
>> ISRAEL IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION. WHO THEY
MAKE PEACE WITH? HALF OF THE PALESTINIAN ARE RULED BY BY
CORRUPTIVE LEADERSHIP THAT LACKS... (BACKGROUND NOISE). SOME OF
THE CRITICISMS WE HAVE HEARD SHOW THAT ISRAEL WAS GOOD.
PALESTINIANS GO THROUGH CHECKPOINTS FOR MEDICAL CARE AND THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT UNITED STATES DOESN'T PROVIDE TO AMERICANS IS FREE
MEDICAL CARE. BDS IS STEEPED IN ANTISEMITISM. ONE OF THE LEADERS
FROM THE UNITED STATES, FROM DETROIT, CALLED FOR THE MOVEMENT TO
STOP CONDEMNING ANTISEMITISM AND MANY RALLIES HAVE TURNED INTO
VIOLENCE ATTACKS ON RANDOM JEWISH PASSERBY.
THERE'S ANOTHER CONSPIRACY THEORY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: STEVE? I DON'T SEE A LAST NAME.
>> IF YOU ARE IN THE ZOOM, YOU MIND RAISING YOUR HAND?
>> DAVID FISHER BACK? WE CAN GO TO HIM.
>> THANK YOU. I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT HARVARD. I HAVE BEEN
TEACHING THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. I STRONGLY OPPOSE 109 AND
BELIEVE AS A BDS SPONSORED POLICY, THIS IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SPEW
HATRED. IT WILL SKEW THE FACTS. IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THIS IS
SPECIFICALLY AS AN ORGANIZATION AND THE POLICIES IT ESPOUSES OPPOSED
BY PRESIDENT BIDEN, AND OPPOSED BY FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA. EVERY
GOVERNOR IT IS HURTFUL, DISRESPECTFUL, AND IT WILL PROMOTE FEAR
FOR MANY CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE NO.
>> TYLER BROWN.
>> THANK YOU. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND I SUPPORT THE ADOPTION
OF THE POLICY ORDER 109. ADOPTING THIS ORDER IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP
FOR THE CITY, COMMUNITY, TO REJECT MILITARIZED POLICING,
DISCRIMINATORY POLICING AND HARASSMENT. IT IS ABOUT A COMPANY
THAT IS MAKING CONCERTED BUSINESS AND MAKE MONEY FROM THE
ONGOING MILITARIZED POLICING AND RESULT IN SUFFERING OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE HARASSMENT OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE
IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MUST OPPOSE IT EVERYWHERE. WE OPPOSE
MILITARY POLICE HERE, WE OPPOSE IT EVERYWHERE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

TO THIS DEEPLY UNFORTUNATE ATTEMPT TO IMPORT THE HUNDRED YEAR
WAR INTO OUR CITY. I HAD DINNER WITH MY 96 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER
TONIGHT WHO SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST AND SPENT PORTIONS OF THE
LAST TWO WEEKS HIDING IN BOMB MISSILES COME DOWN. THE FIRST CITY IN
THE COUNTRY AS REFUGE, TO MAKE ANTISEMITISM THE OFFICIAL POLICY IS
PAINFUL. IT IS NOT ANTISemitic TO CRITICIZE OR TO DISAPPROVE OF THE
ISRAEL GOVERNMENT. I DISAPPROVE MYSELF, AS I DID OF THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT FROM 2017 TO 2021. TO SINGLE OUT THE ONE
JEWISH STATE IS ANTISEMITIC AND I URGE YOU REJECT TO DO SO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS STEVEN.
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> OKAY. THIS IS STEVE'S WIFE. HE ASKED ME TO READ IT FOR HIM. HE LIVES
IN CAMBRIDGE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD. THERE ARE PRESSED MINORITIES IN INDIA, CHINA, PAKISTAN,
TURKEY, SAUDI ARABIA AND MANY OTHER NATIONS. THIS IS FOCUSSED IN
ONE NATION IN THE WORLD, ISRAEL. WHEN ONE IGNORES HUMAN RIGHTS
ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE WORD, THE FOCUS IS ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS
ISSUES IN THE ONLY JEWISH STATE, THERE'S A TERM FOR THAT. IT IS CALLED
ANTISEMITISM. THE CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD NOT ADOPT AN
ANTISemitic POLICY. I ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST POLICY ORDER 109. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, I THINK WE HAVE EMMI?
>> HI. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE SINCE 2010, WHEN
I GRADUATED FROM MIT. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. ISRAELI AMERICAN,
I'M A BUSINESS PERSON AND A MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN WHO ATTEND
CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOL. MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE. I LOVE CAMBRIDGE
AND FEEL PART OF THE COMMUNITY. I WOULD LIKE TO REMAIN, BUT I'M
WORRIED I MAY NO LONGER FEEL LIKE I CAN. I'M A MULTIRACIAL MAKEUP
AND WE VALUE TALENT, HOPE, PROMISE, AND PEACE. THE POLITICAL
SITUATION IN NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
TAKE A SIDE ON A COMPLEX TOPIC, WHERE IT MAY ALIENATE THE
POPULATION. I HAPPEN TO BE AN ISRAELI I WAS IN ISRAEL WHEN THIS
HAPPENED I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER 109.
NOT ALIENATE MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN AND MY COMMUNITY. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: DANIEL?
>> IF YOU ARE ON THE PHONE, YOU HAVE TO DIAL STAR SIX TO UNMUTE.
>> HI, ISRAELI, AND SUPPORT PALESTINIAN LIVES.
(INAUDIBLE)
IT IS DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY PALESTINIANS, JEWS WORK SHOULDER TO
SHOULDER. THE POLICIES AFFECT ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS WHO
DEPEND ON THE ISRAELI EMPLOYERS TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. A CO
FOUNDER OF HAMAS, HAS PUBLICLY EXPOSED HAMAS. BDS WILL CALL FOR

EAST THAT OFFERS MORE RIGHTS TO ARABS THAN THEIR OWN HOMELAND.
THEY RUN ON ANTISemitic
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ALI.
>> HI. I'M A RESEARCHER AT TEN WILSON STREET IN CAMBRIDGE. SCIENTIST
FOR PALESTINIAN LIBERATION AND I URGE YOU TO ADOPT THE POLICY
ORDERS. ZIONIST ENTITY THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS BENT ON THE
ANNIHILATION AND BANISHMENT... THESE ACTIONS RECON OFFICIAL THAT
ISRAEL WILL CONTINUE WITH THE GENOCIDE ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE
OUTCRY. THEREFORE, THEY MUST FACE CONSEQUENCES, THE
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED BY HP AND OTHER COMPANIES. BY PASSING
THE POLICY ORDER, CAMBRIDGE CAN BECOME A NATIONAL LEADER AND
SEND A STRONG MESSAGE TO ALL CORPORATIONS THAT THE SUPPORT OF
APARTHEID STATE IS INTOLERABLE AND CAN STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE
PEOPLE OF PALESTINE. IT IS SIMPLE NOT AND ANTISemitic. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LAURA?
>> LAURA, ROCKINGHAM STREET. I GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE. LIVED AND
WORKED HERE FOR NINE YEARS. MY PARENTS HAVE FOR 50 YEARS AND THE
WONDERFUL CAMBRIDGEPORT COMMUNITY, MY BEST FRIEND IS IRANIAN.
MY JEWISH IDENTITY IS NEVER A BARRIER. I SUPPORT THE TWO STATE
SOLUTION THAT WILL RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF JEWS AND PALESTINIANS TO
SELF DETERMINATION. THIS IS A FORM OF BDS. THEY DON'T SUPPORT TWO
STATE SOLUTION AND A MOVEMENT TO DELEGITIMIZE ISRAEL AND
ELIMINATE IT AS A JEWISH STATE. THE PREMISE OF THIS ORDER COMPARING
ISRAEL TO APARTHEID IS INSULTING AND INACCURATE. COMPARISONS LIKE
ARE REPEATED AND SPREAD FALSE AND DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT
ISRAEL AND JEWS. IT IS SCARY AND DOES NOTHING TO ADVANCE PEACE. IT IS
A CALCULATED ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT
HUMAN RIGHTS. THE LIES CONTRIBUTE TO ANTISEMITISM AND DISTRUST
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. SPEAKING FOR POLICY ORDERS. I HOPE WE CAN RESTORE THE
CULTURES THAT EXISTED IN THE WEST ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST BEFORE
COLONIALISM. AFTER THE INITIAL PROTEST AGAINST ISRAELI VIOLENCE, I SAW
PROTESTERS THAT RECEIVED A MESSAGE WARNING THEY WOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROTEST.
IT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAYS THE ISRAELI STATE WILL USE HP'S
TECHNOLOGY TO TRACK, DIVIDE, AND RUIN THE LIVES OF PALESTINIANS. IT IS
USED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. MANY CLAIMS... SORRY. I'M DONE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JUDY.
>> HI. ONE SECOND. I'M MIT AND ALUMNI AND LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR
FOUR YEARS. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 129. I'M
A GRANDDAUGHTER OF A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR AND MY GREAT
GRANDFATHER WAS MURDERED. I'M SCARED ABOUT THE RISE IN


PAGE 78

May 24, 2021

ANTISEMITISM. IT IS DUE TO THE ONE SIDED NARRATIVE OF THE CONFLICT
PORTRAYED BY THE MEDIA. BDS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE ANTISEMITISM
BECAUSE IT IS ONE SIDED. IT CAMPAIGNS REPRESENT A HOSTILE
DELEGITIMIZATION THAT REST ON THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. WE
SHOULD WORK TOWARD PEACE AND CO EXISTENCE AND BDS WILL PREVENT
THIS. A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH IS TO BUILD BRIDGES, PROMOTE
ACTION AND PRIMARY BOTH SOCIETIES FOR PEACE. I FEEL UNSAFE LIVING IN
A CITY THAT SUPPORTS A ONE SIDED AND DANGEROUS ANTISemitic POLICY.
PROMOTE PIECE AND REJECT BDS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BENJAMIN?
>> HELLO. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE DURING COLLEGE AS A UNDER GRAD AND
WORKED IN THE AREA. I NO LONGER LIVE IN THE AREA. I URGE YOU TO VOTE
AGAINST THE POLICIES DISCUSSED HERE AND I ECHO COMMENTS BY MANY
SPEAKERS THAT SPOKE ABOUT OPPOSING BDS AND THE MEASURES. I ECHO
THEM BECAUSE THEY SPOKE MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I MIGHT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SARAH?
>> I'M SARAH. I LIVE AT 39 PRINCE STREET AND A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF
CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE
POLICY ORDERS. WITH BOTH THE POLICIES WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
TAKE LOCAL ACTION ON INTERSECTION OF OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE
FACED BY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND PALESTINIANS AND
OCCUPIED PALESTINE. THE OVERLAPS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT TONIGHT, I
WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY BDS. THE BDS MOVEMENT IS
LAUNCHED IN 2005 BY 170 PALESTINIAN SOCIETY GROUPS THAT CAME
TOGETHER AND CALLED OUT IN A VOICE SAYING IF YOU BELIEVE THAT
PALESTINIAN SHOULD BE FREE, HERE IS WHAT WE NEED YOU TO DO TO HELP
US MAKE IT SO. LOCALLY WHERE YOU ARE BOYCOTT AND DIVEST FROM
COMPANIES, INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER ACTORS WHO UPHOLD AND PROFIT
FROM THE VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT TOWARD US AND SANCTION IS REALLY GOVERNMENT.
PALESTINIANS HAVE TOLD US SINCE FIRST COMING TOGETHER AROUND THIS
CALL
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THAT'S TIME. NEXT PERSON.
>> HI EVERYBODY.
>> WE CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU HEAR US?
>> MY AUDIO MAY HAVE GONE OUT. ONE SECOND.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> GREAT. I LIVE IN CENTRAL SQUARE. I WILL SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE
POLICY ORDERS. AS MANY OTHERS HAVE STATED, THE BDS IS ANTISemitic.
DUE IN PART TO HOLDING ETHICAL STANDARDS IN OTHER STARTS AND
IGNORING THE ACTIONS OF HAMAS WHICH SHOOTS ROCKETS AT CIVILIANS.
IF IT IS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS, WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE AGAINST SYRIA,
CHINA, OR AGAINST PALESTINE FOR THE PERSECUTION OF LGBTQ

COMMUNITY. AND THERE'S A SHARP UPTICK THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,
INCLUDING ATTACKS IN L.A. AND NEW YORK, SYNAGOGUES IN ARIZONA,
ILLINOIS, AND INCIDENTS OF ANTISemitic AGAINST CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: LIAT?
>> HI. I MOVED HERE FROM ISRAEL SEVEN YEARS AGO TO ATTEND HARVARD.
I WORK IN KENDALL SQUARE AND I ASK YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THE POLICY
ORDER. IT IS IMPORTING HATE TO CAMBRIDGE. I HAVE BEEN PROMOTING
CONFLICT RESOLUTION THROUGH MY VOLUNTEER WORK FOR THE LAST 20
YEARS. AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED BY
PEACEFUL DIALOGUE. HOWEVER, BDS IS THE OPPOSITE OF PEACEFUL
DIALOGUE. RECENTLY, BDS REPORTER SEND ME THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE
ON SOCIAL MEDIA. RAPE TO YOU AND ALL DAUGHTERS OF ISRAELI. WHY
SHOULD WE IMPORT THIS HATE TO CAMBRIDGE. I HOPE YOU JOIN ME IN
VOTING AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING IN
CAMBRIDGE AND FEELING SAFE HERE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JONAH?
>> HELLO. I'M JONAH. I'M A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE AND A JEW. I'M HERE
TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION. THROUGH MY LIFE IN THE CAMBRIDGE
PUBLIC SCHOOL, I WAS DROVE WITH THE VALUE OF OPPORTUNITY, DIVERSITY
AND RESPECT. I BELIEVE WE MUST SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION AND DO THE
MINIMUM TO STAND UP FOR THE VALUES. OPPOSE THE STATE THAT ENACTS
RACIALIZED LEGAL SYSTEM AND OPPOSE THE CORE VALUES OF DIVERSITY AND
INCLUSION. OPPOSE THE STATE THAT ENACTS ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND
BLOCKS INDIGENOUS GROUPS. WE MOVE OPPOSE THE STATE THAT SHOWS
NO RESPECT FOR LIVES OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN AS THEY BOMB KEY WATER
AND INFRASTRUCTURE. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTIONS. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF.
>> HI. HELLO?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSALS
REGARDING ISRAEL. I SPEAK FOR MANY ISRAELI FRIENDS, UNDER GRADS, ALL
WHO LIVE AND STUDY IN THE UNIVERSITIES IN CAMBRIDGE. THEY ARE
AFRAID TO SPEAK UP. AND VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE HARMFUL
RESOLUTIONS. THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE ENOUGH HERE IN CAMBRIDGE TO DO
SO. THE FEARS STEM FROM THE RESOLUTIONS PRECISELY, RESOLUTIONS
THAT AFFECT ISRAELI, JEWS AND EVERYONE IN CAMBRIDGE BY
CONTRIBUTING TO A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO
DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF NATIONAL RELIGION. THE RESOLUTIONS ARE
SETTING DANGEROUS RESIDENT. PRECEDENT. PRECEDENT CONTRARY TO
THE IDEAS THAT THE GREAT NATION WAS FOUNDED ON. THANK YOU FOR


PAGE 80

May 24, 2021

ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO AND
REJECT THE RESOLUTIONS. SHALOM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> IS IT WORKING? THANK YOU. I'M A STUDENT IN CAMBRIDGE. HERE TO
SPEAK OUT AGAINST BDS POLICY 109. IT IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WITH A LONG
HISTORY. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT CAN ONLY BE SOLVED THROUGH
DIALOGUE AND COMMUNICATION. THE RHETORIC UTILIZED BY THE
MOVEMENT DOESN'T GIVE A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION. THE PALESTINIAN ARAB
POPULATION, ISRAEL HAS GROWN OVER TEN FOLD SINCE THE
ESTABLISHMENT AND IT IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE
THE CHRISTIAN POPULATION IS GROWING. THE BDS PRESENTS ONE SIDED
RESOLUTION, WHICH WILL AIM TO WIDEN THE DIVIDE. I BELIEVE ALL HUMAN
BEINGS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAFETY AND SECURITY. FROM ORGANIZED
TERROR AND ISRAELIS ARE NO EXCEPTION. RATHER THAN BOYCOTT HP, I
SUGGEST WE BOYCOTT HAMAS, THEY TERRORIZE ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS
ALIKE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> HELLO. I'M A DOCTORAL STUDENT. I DON'T FEEL SAFE SHARING MY
ADDRESS. AS AN AMERICAN, A WOMAN AND A PROUD JEW LIVED IN ISRAEL, I
OPPOSE 109 AND 129 AND I URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME. AS COUNCIL
MEMBERS THE DUTY IS TO THE SECURITY AND WELL BEING OF THE CITIZENS
OF CAMBRIDGE. LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TESTIFIED.
NOT A SINGLE SUPPORTER OF THE POLICIES HAVE SAID THEY WOULD FEEL
UNSAFE IF THEY DON'T PASS. MANY OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION FEEL
PHYSICALLY THREATEN AND UNSAFE IF THEY DO PASS. BDS WILL ENDANGER
ISRAELI AND CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS. IT IS RACIST AND THE POLICIES ARE
AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC JEWISH STATE AND RUN COUNTER TO THE
DISCRIMINATION POLICY. YOU MUST BUILD BRIDGES FOR PEACE AND NOT
TEAR THEM DOWN. VOTE NO. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: ANANYA?
>> HI. I LIVE ON MAPLE AVENUE AND WILL SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER. I
GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE AND DURING MY FOUR YEARS IN COLLEGE, I WAS
PART OF STUDENTS FOR JUSTICE IN PALESTINE. WE WERE FACED BY FAILED
INTIMIDATION TACTICS. BE VERY CLEAR, IT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT WILL ONCE AGAIN VIOLATE PALESTINIAN HUMAN
RIGHTS, BUT WHEN. JUST TODAY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE MEETING, THE
ISRAELI OCCUPATION FORCES OBTAINED A TEN YEAR OLD BOY. I HEAR THE
CONFLICT IS COMPLEX. WHAT IS COMPLEX ABOUT THAT? WAS HE A HUMAN
SHIELD THAT HAMAS USED WHEN PLAYING OUTSIDE WITH THE SISTER?
SUPPORT BDS POLICY ORDER 109, ANYTHING ELSE IS COMPLICITY. THANK
YOU. FREE PALESTINE!
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> I'M A STUDENT HERE IN CAMBRIDGE. AND I'M HERE TO VOICE THE
SUPPORT FOR BOTH POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. AS HAS BEEN POINTED

OUT, HP IS NOT THE JUMP THE COMPANY THAT HAPPENS TO DO BUSINESS IN
ISRAEL, IT IS ONE THAT IS COMPLICIT IN ISRAEL SYSTEM OF RACIAL
APARTHEID. BESIDES SELLING EQUIPMENT TO THE ISRAELI POLICE, THE IDEA
OF HP CREATED THE BIOMETRIC ID SYSTEM, THE ISRAEL STATE USE TO TRACK
AND CONTROL PALESTINIAN. THEY ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN ENABLING
ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT IN THE WEST BANK. THEY COMPILE INFORMATION ON
THE SETTLERS IN THE WEST BANK. I ASK THAT YOU DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM
VOTING FOR THE RESOLUTION OUT OF FEAR THAT THE CONTROVERSIAL IT
MAY ATTRACT. CAUSES INVOLVING RACIAL JUSTICE THAT COMES FROM A
PLACE OF DEEP CONVICTION WILL ALWAYS BE CALLED DECISIVENESS
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> HI. I'M KATHY. SIX DECADES, A LITTLE MORE, CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT.
AND I WANT TO SPEAK ON THE POLICY ORDER 114. TAKE PART. WHAT A GIFT
TO THE CITY COUNCIL. WHAT A GIFT TO THE CITY. LOCAL PROJECT LED BY
CAMBRIDGE BLACK AND BROWN RESIDENTS, RINDGE AND LATIN GRADUATES,
A YEAR AFTER THE GEORGE FLOYD MURDER, RATHER THAN CRITIQUE
POLICIES OF POLICING, THEY TOOK A MASSIVE PROACTIVE STANCE TO CREATE
HOLISTIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. THEY DID THE RESEARCH, THEY DID
NETWORKING, THEY HAVE DONE COMMUNITY BUILDING. THEY TALKED TO
SIMILAR PROJECTS. SAY YES, VOTE WITH MONEY. AND VOTE FAST. 109,
THERE'S NOT TIME TO SAY THAT ISRAEL IS SINGLED OUT FOR THE MILITARY
AID IT RECEIVES. AND THAT SETS IT UP FOR CRITIQUE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MELISSA?
>> HELLO. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO UNANIMOUSLY VOTE
YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS. I AM JEWISH, I'M AN ANTIZIONIST, I'M A
STORYTELLER. I REHEARSE, STUDY, TEACH, AND DIRECT, AND PERFORM IN
CAMBRIDGE. MY WORK IS TO UPLIFT UNHEARD VOICES. I BELIEVE THAT THE
BOYCOTT OF HP BRANDED CORPORATIONS WILL GIVE CAMBRIDGE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO LIFT UP THE VOICES OF PALESTINIANS WHO HAVE BEEN
MOSTLY UNHEARD UNDER MILITARY RULE BY ISRAEL. AND I REALLY LIKE TO
SPEAK TO SAFETY AS A JEW. I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE AS LONG AS POLICIES
RELY ON ALLOWING CITIZENS TO TAKE OVER SOMEONE ELSE'S HOMES. AND
TO TRACK PEOPLE AND TO STOP THEM AT CHECKPOINTS AND HP IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JONATHAN?
>> I SUPPORT HEART AND OTHER CHARTER RIGHT ONE AND TWO. LAST
WEEK I WARNED THAT MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHANCE TO HAVE
THE VOICE HEARD BECAUSE THE COUNCIL MEETING WAS TIMED TO TAKE
PLACE DURING THE HOLIDAY. THE THOUSANDS OF EMAILS AND
COMMENTERS I HOPE THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS IS UNDENIABLE. THE LEAD
SPONSOR IGNORED MY WARNINGS AND TRIED TO FORGE AHEAD. ARGUING
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ACTION SOMEHOW JUSTIFIED DISENFRANCHISING
A GROUP OF JEWS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IS ANTISemitic. THANK YOU
FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO SPEAK.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO ABEER? GO AHEAD.
>> SORRY. CAN YOU PUT THE TIME BACK?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CLERK, CAN YOU START THE TIME?
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS. I'M A
PALESTINIAN AMERICAN AND THE PRIVILEGE TO BE BORN IN CAMBRIDGE. MY
PRIVILEGE OF BEING LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BORN ON THIS LAND CARRIES A
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO POINT OUT ISRAEL IS A DEMOCRACY AND SO IS THE
UNITED STATES. WE SEE THE INJUSTICES THAT BLACK AND BROWN SISTERS
FACE. THESE ARE THE SAME FOLKS WHO HAVE THE KINGS FAIRNESS AND
JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL IS REWARDED, THE colonizers
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. (REPEATING A QUOTE). (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO
RAPID SPEAKING/READING).
PASS THE RESOLUTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. GOING TO LUBNA?
>> HI. SO, I LIVE ON THIRD STREET. PH.D. STUDENT AT MIT. CAMBRIDGE IS
MY HOME FOR SIX YEARS AND I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDER.
I'M HUMAN FIRST AND A PALESTINIAN SECOND. SEEING MY OWN PEOPLE
BEING VICTIMS TO CLEANSING, WHICH IS GOING ON FOR 73 YEARS, IT HITS
CLOSE TO HOME. I'M ASKING THE COUNCIL TO UNANIMOUSLY VOTE YES
BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT AND ETHICALLY THING TO DO. IT IS ETHICAL TO
DIVEST FROM COMPANIES AND IT IS MORE URGENT TO DIVEST FROM RIGHT
TO LIVE AND FREEDOM, LIVING TO HOME. FREE SPEECH. YOU NAME IT. BDS
IS A PEACEFUL RESISTANCE (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID
SPEAKING/READING).
YOU CAN FIND THE TESTIMONIES ONLINE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JOSEPH.
>> HI. I'M JOSEPH. MIT UNDERGRAD ON MEMORIAL DRIVE. LIVED IN
CAMBRIDGE FOR TWO YEARS AND HOPES TO CONTINUE DOING SO FOR MANY
MORE. I WILL GO ON RECORD OPPOSING THE ORDER 109. THE CAMBRIDGE
CITY COUNCIL PROCEEDED WITH THE HEARING ON THE RESOLUTION AFTER
HAVING BEEN NOTIFIED DAYS IN ADVANCE THAT MANY JEWS WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO ATTEND DUE TO OBSERVANCE OF SHAVUOT. THIS IS DEEPLY
CONCERNING TO ME AS A JEW WHO WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK LAST WEEK. I'M
GRATEFUL FOR THE COUNCILLORS WHO DEFERRED THE VOTE. I WALK
THROUGH THE CAMBRIDGE, A CLEAR SYMBOL OF JUDAISM, IF THE
CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL OFFICIALLY TAKES THE STEP OF DEMONIZING
ISRAELI I WILL NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN THE CITY. THANK YOU.

>> GOOD EVENING. I'M EVAN. LIVE ON HARVARD STREET IN MID
CAMBRIDGE. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. THOSE WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR


PAGE 83

May 24, 2021

ARE ASKING THE CITY COUNCIL TO SUPPORT A POLICY THAT MAY HAVE
IMPACTS HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD AND WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING
FOR CAMBRIDGE. MANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST IT BECAUSE
THEY FEAR FOR THE SAFETY AS JEWS HERE. THE COUNCIL'S RESPONSIBLE IS
TO THE RESIDENT, NOT TO PEOPLE LIVING FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. I'M
JEWISH, RIGHT NOW I'M TERRIFIED. REGARDLESS OF THE INTENT OF BDS, THE
TERRORIZATION OF AMERICAN JEWS, VIOLENCE IN JEWISH NEIGHBORHOODS
AND VANDALIZATION OF SYNAGOGUES. WE BOUGHT A HOME IN CAMBRIDGE
TO RAISE A FAMILY, THE ONE SIDED RESOLUTION IS NOT A PATH TO PEACE.
PLEASE MAKE ALLOW JEWS TO FEEL WELCOME. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: IS SUZANNE BACK?
>> THANK YOU. I WILL SPEAK TO THREE THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN
FOCUSSED ON. TAKE HEART, I SUPPORT THAT STRONGLY. I THANK YOU FOR
HONORING SENIORS AND URGE YOU TO PUSHBACK AGAINST THE INCREASING
AGEIST ATTACKS AND I DON'T SUPPORT THE ISSUE ON CONSERVATION
DISTRICTS. I URGE YOU TO PUT THAT ON FILE. SIMPLY POLICY ORDER BY
COUNCIL CAN REQUEST THE CITY MANAGER ASSURE THE CONSERVATION
DISTRICT MEMBERS ARE REPRESENTATIVE. AND MAKES NO SENSE TO
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES TO A HUNDRED OR THOUSAND
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE CRITERIA, MEANING THE GEOGRAPHY. THE
COST OF RENTERS AND HOME OWNERS. CAMBRIDGE WITH THE RICH
ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY IS A TOURIST MECCA. THIS IS NOT ABOUT
DIVERSITY OR EQUITY OR INCLUSION BECAUSE THEY HAVE OPPOSED THE EAST
CAMBRIDGE FACTORY WORKERS HERE. THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR
STAYING UP LATE TO HEAR EVERYBODY'S VOICE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT PERSON. IT IS 11:31. PER
THE RULES, WE HAVE TO END THE MEETING AT MIDNIGHT UNLESS THERE'S A
MOTION TO EXTEND OR TO DO A RECESS.
>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN: I KNOW IT IS A LONG NIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A LOT TO GO THROUGH TOMORROW. I THINK WE SHOULD STICK IT
OUT UNTIL PUBLIC COMMENT IS OVER AND THEN RECESS. TOMORROW WE
CAN GET TO BUSINESS. THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AT MIDNIGHT. YOU WANT
US TO DO IT NOW OR KEEP GOING?
>> YOU CAN WAIT TO DO THE ACT ON THE MOTION AT MIDNIGHT.

Motion to Suspend the Rules to
extend the meeting to conclude
public comment

>> HI. I'M SARAH. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR SIX YEARS ON MASS AVENUE.
AND I OPPOSE THE POLICY OPPOSITION RESOLUTION 109. I HAVE BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH TO REMEMBER IT CAME UP IN 2018. TO SUM UP MY
FEELINGS ON WHY I FEEL THIS IS WRONG, I WILL QUOTE CRAIG KELLY,
FORMER COUNCILLOR, LOUSY WAY TO MANIPULATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IF
YOU WANT TO TAKE STANCES ON GOOD AND BAD IN THE WORD AND
ARGUABLY WE SHOULD, IT ONLY SEEMS FAIR THAT WE DO SO VIA SOME
AGREED UPON CRITERIA THAT DOESN'T SINGLE OUT ENTITIES FOR THE SAKE
OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE. IT SEEMS YOU ARE SINGLING OUT THE ONLY
JEWISH COUNTRY AND I FEEL UNSAFE IN CAMBRIDGE. THANK YOU. I YIELD
MY TIME TO SLEEP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: REBECCA?
>> HELLO. REBECCA. HARVARD STUDENT AND LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR
THREE YEARS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TWO MORE YEARS. I WILL GO ON
RECORD OPPOSING THE HP ORDER 109 AND RESOLUTION 129. ACCORDING
TO THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER FOR FINANCE, IT IS NEARLY SEVEN YEARS
SINCE CAMBRIDGE HAS HAD A DIRECT PURCHASE ORDER WITH HP. THE
RESOLUTION IS ADDRESSING A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. IT IS A SHAM
WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO DEMONIZE ISRAEL. DEMONIZING ISRAEL WILL SPIRAL
INTO TARGETING JEWS AS I LEARNED FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK
AND L.A. IF YOU PASS THE BILL I WILL NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE CITY.
ENDORSING BDS HAS NO POSITIVE EFFECT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SEVENS
TO MAKE JEWISH RESIDENTS FEEL UNSAFE. I WILL MENTION THAT BEN IS
TRYING TO SPEAK. IN THE PAST HE WAS CALLED AND HAD TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTY. IF THE CLERK CAN CIRCLE BACK TO HIM, THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO BENJAMIN FISHER?
>> HELLO. I'M A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE AND I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER.
PASSING THE RESOLUTION IS HARMFUL TO MY COMMUNITY AND SINGLE OUT
ISRAEL MAKES ME FEEL UNSAFE AS A JEWISH STUDENT IN CAMBRIDGE.
THANK YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: JULIE?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I APPRECIATE
YOUR PATIENCE. I'M PROUD YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE ORDERS. I SEE
THEM AS PATH BREAKING. CUTTING EDGE RESPONSES TO THE CRISES THAT
WE SUFFER ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND I THINK WE ARE AWARE, MANY OF
US ARE AWARE, WE NEED TO MAKE A SHIFT FROM AN ECONOMY AND
SOCIETY THAT IS BASED ON INEQUALITY AND DOMINATION TO A SOCIETY
BASED ON COOPERATION AND SOLIDARITY AND TO ENACT A SOCIALLY
RESPONSIBILITY CONSUMPTION POLICY AS BEING SUGGESTED AND
PROPOSED IN 109. I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL. REQUIRING THAT THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE EXERCISE ITS VALUES AND THE PURCHASING DECISION, THIS IS
NOT
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. TWO PEOPLE WE SKIPPED?
>> STEVE.
>> I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL, SIX HOURS, NO BIO BREAK. THAT'S
HEROIC IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. I WILL SPEAK OUT AGAINST 109. ONE POINT,
THOSE IN FAVOR, KEEP USING THE TERMINOLOGY OF WHITE SUPREMACY
AND COLONIALISM AND NOBODY WILL STAND UP IN SUPPORT OF THOSE,
EXCEPT THAT DOESN'T DESCRIBE THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. JEWS
HAVE BEEN INDIGENOUS TO THE REGION FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. JESUS
WAS A JEW AND THAT'S 2,000 YEARS AGO WHEN THE ROMANS KICKED HIS
BUTT. THERE'S A HISTORY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING, THE JEWS ON THE
RECEIVING END. AND THIS BDS THING, WHEN YOU THE PROGRESSIVE
STUFF, IT WILL SOUND RIGHT AND IGNORE THE REALITY OF THE PLACE. BIG
MISTAKE TO STEP INTO THIS AND WILL HEIGHTEN ALL SORTS OF ANTISemitic
ENERGY. NOT A WISE THING TO DO. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK LIZA WENT. NEXT PERSON? JOSEPH?
>> HI. PROFESSOR AT MIT. AND I HAD THE HONOR OF FOUNDING THREE
COMPANIES IN CAMBRIDGE, WHICH IS CREATED HUNDREDS OF JOBS. OVER
THE LAST TWO DECADES. I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT AGAINST THE POLICY
ORDER AND AGAINST BDS. IT IS A SINGLE OBJECTIVE, DIVISION OF PEOPLE
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL. SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WILL MAKE
CAMBRIDGE LESS WELCOMING FOR MYSELF, JEWS AND ISRAELIS. WE HAVE A
CHOICE TO MAKE. BANDING TOGETHER TO DO GREAT THINGS IN SCIENCE
AND MEDICINE OR DIVIDE PEOPLE. I URGE YOU TO REJECT POLICY ORDERS
AND KEEP CAMBRIDGE OPEN AND WELCOMING FOR ALL PEOPLE. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OREN? ARE YOU THERE?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU. HELLO. I'M A RECENT MIT ALUMNI. I VOLUNTEERED
FOR MANY YEARS TEACHING MATH IN CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND A
CURRENT MEMBER OF THE CAMBRIDGE JEWISH COMMUNITY, WHO ATTENDS
WEEKLY RELIGIOUS SERVICES IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M OPPOSED TO THE POLICY
ORDER 109 BECAUSE IT SINGLES OUT THE ONLY JEWISH MAJORITY COUNTRY
FOR BOYCOTT, DEMONIZING JEWISH PEOPLE, AND ISRAELI PEOPLE. AND

THEREFORE PUTS THE SAFETY OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE IN
GRAVE DANGER. MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, WHO LIVE AND WORK
IN CAMBRIDGE, ARE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE RESOLUTION. INCLUDING,
INCLUDING MY FATHER, WHO IS A JEWISH REFUGEE FROM RELIGIOUS
PERSECUTION FROM EGYPT. I URGE YOU TO REJECT THE POLICY ORDER TO
KEEP CAMBRIDGE SAFE AND WELCOMING FOR ALL OF ITS CITIZENS. THANK
YOU.

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP? ANNA?
>> GO AHEAD.
>> HI. I'M AN MIT STUDENT AND LIVE ON COLUMBIA STREET. I SPEAK IN
OPPOSITION OF THE RESOLUTION AND POLICY ORDER 109. IT IS BEING
OPENLY PROMOTE AS THE GLOBAL MEDIA MOVEMENT AGAINST ISRAEL. IT IS
NOT TO CHANGE ISRAELI POLICY, BUT TO (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID

AGAINST LOCAL JEWISH COMMUNITIES. ANTISEMITISM IS RISING AND JEWS
HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED BY PROTESTORS IN L.A., TORONTO AND ELSEWHERE. I
URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER 109 AND RESOLUTION 129 TO KEEP
CAMBRIDGE A SAFE PLACE FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: TALI?
>> HELLO. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE. I'M
TALI. RESIDENT OF MASS AVENUE AND A GRADUATE OF HARVARD. THANK
YOU FOR THE ACCOMMODATION ON THIS VOTE TO HEAR MY VOICE. I STAND
IN OPPOSITION OF THIS RESOLUTION, IN THE WAKE OF AN INCREASED
ANTIZIONIST RHETORIC, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN ANTISemitic. I URGE YOU
TO CONSIDER THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF ALL CONSTITUENTS YOU
SERVE AND STAND UP AGAINST THE POLICY THAT WILL MAKE MANY FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNSAFE. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> OKAY. I'M A SENIOR CITIZEN WHO LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR CLOSE TO 40
YEARS. I HAVE TO SAY, I WAS I ALREADY FELT ATTACKED WHEN I SAW THIS
PROPOSITION. BDS HAS CLEARLY BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE ANTISEMITISM
WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE RISE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES FOR YEARS.
NOTHING NEW. AS A JEW, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO HOME ANYMORE. I USED TO
CONSIDER MYSELF A PROGRESSIVE. TO BE PROGRESSIVE NOW, YOU HAVE TO
ACCEPT ANTISEMITISM. IT IS OVERLOOKED FOR REGRESSIVE CAUSES. THE
REPUBLICANS ONLY CALL OUT ANTISEMITISM WHEN IS IT ON THE LEFT AND


PAGE 87

May 24, 2021

THE DEMOCRATS ONLY CALL IT OUT WHEN IT IS ON THE RIGHT. SUPPORTING
THIS RESOLUTION WILL MAKE ME FEEL MORE UNSAFE AS I DO AS A
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. PLEASE REJECT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON?
>> HI. I'M AB. I OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE IF IS A DOUBLE
STANDARD, NO RESOLUTIONS RELATED TO THE ACTIONS OF CHINA AND THE
PRODUCTS. AND BECAUSE I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE. I EXPERIENCED
ANTISEMITISM WHILE IN CAMBRIDGE AND THAT'S PART OF MY DECISION NOT
TO RETURN TO CAMBRIDGE FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL. AND THIS ITEM AND
THE RESOLUTION, BDS WILL PROVE TO INCREASE ANTISEMITISM MAKES ME
FEAR TO RETURN FOR A VISIT. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> HI. MY HUSBAND WORKS AT MIT AND LIVE ON BEACON STREET. WE
OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS. I HAVE TO SAY I'M SHOCKED TO HEAR PEOPLE
WHO ARE SO SENSITIVE TO SOCIAL ISSUES, PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY
CONCERN WITH THE LANGUAGE THEY USE TO TALK ABOUT ANY GROUP,
SPEAK SUCH LIES ABOUT THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND THE ACTIONS IT TAKES TO
DEFEND ITSELF AND THE CLEAR GENOCIDE. THE PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE
USING HYPERBOLE, MISSTATING FACTS AND LYING ABOUT ISRAEL AND THE
PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. AND THEY BUILD ON THE LIES TO CAST THOSE
WHO INTERACT WITH THE STATE AS WRONGDOERS. IT WILL BEHOOVE
ANYONE WITH A CONCERN FOR THE TRUTH, FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE, REJECT
THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE OF THE LIES AND falsities. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE HAVE BRADLEY.
>> BRADLEY. I OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDERS. I WAS BORN IN SOUTH AFRICA
AND MY FAMILY HAS A HISTORY OF FIGHTING AGAINST APARTHEID REGIME.
ISRAEL IS NOT AN APARTHEID STATE AND TO USE THE TERM ETHNIC
CLEANSING IT IS REPREHENSIBLE. THEY HAVE EXPRESSED THE DESIRE FOR
PEACE WITH THE PALESTINIAN NEIGHBORS TO BE MET WITH RESISTANCE,
THAT CONDEMN THEIR OWN PEOPLE RATHER THAN A TWO STATE SOLUTION.
ISRAEL DOES EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO LIMIT COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON
CIVILIANS IN GAZA BEFORE EXECUTING AIR STRIKES. EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS
AND HAMAS FORCES CIVILIANS TO STAY PUT AND USES PEOPLE AS HUMAN
SHIELDS. AND SAY YOU WANT TO DIVEST FROM ISRAEL, GO AHEAD AND
RETURN THE VACCINATION FROM PFIZER AND MODERNA, BOTH OF WISH
HAVE JEWISH CEO AND ISRAELI TIES. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON?
>> THANK YOU. I READ A STATEMENT FROM MY HUSBAND. WE LIVE ON
DANA STREET AND HAVE LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR 18 YEARS. WE URGE YOU
TO VOTE NO ON THE POLICY ORDER. THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT IS
COMPLICATED AND VERY UPSETTING. TO MAKE TRUE PROGRESS AND
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES, REALLY AND POSITIVE STEPS
NEED TO BE TAKEN. THIS POLICY IS NOT SUCH A STEP. IT IS DISAPPOINTING
ONE SIDED AND WILL PUSH THE TWO SIDES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. IF


PAGE 88

May 24, 2021

THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE IS SO INCLINED TO GET INVOLVED IN THE ISRAELI
CONFLICT, I ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONCENTRATE ON POSITIVE ACTION THAT
CAN HELP MOVE THE DIFFICULT SITUATION FORWARD IN A POSITIVE WAY. I
ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> HI. I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT. I HAVE LIVED AND WORKED IN
CAMBRIDGE BIOTECH FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. I MET AND MARRIED MY
HUSBAND IN CAMBRIDGE AND I HAVE VOTED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS AT CITY
HALL. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY FIRM OPPOSITION TO RESOLUTION S.
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE ACTION TO PLACE THE INITIAL HEARING ON THE
JEWISH HOLIDAY LAST WEEK, DENYING THE CONSTITUENTS A VOICE AND
ostracizing COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIKE ME. THE TIMING AND THE CONTENT
OF THE RESOLUTION STRIKES ME AS A HARMFUL, DIVISIVE, AND DECEPTIVE.
ASK YOURSELF, HAS TONIGHT FURTHER DIALOGUE CO EXISTING IN PEACE OR
HAS IT POLARIZED AND FRACTURED THE CAMBRIDGE COMMUNITY? I DID
NOT VOTE FOR THIS COUNCIL TO SPEND THEIR TIME ON MORALLY SELECTIVE
RESOLUTIONS. PLEASE REJECT THE RESOLUTIONS AND FOCUS ON WORK
THAT UNITES AND REPAIRS THE COMMUNITY AT HOME. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> WE HAVE JASON? GO AHEAD.
>> HI, I'M JASON. I LIVE ON PLEASANT STREET NEAR CENTRAL SQUARE.
CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT FOR 13 YEARS. I'M HERE TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO
REJECT THE POLICY ORDER 109. WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO PASS RESOLUTIONS
ON JEWISH HOLIDAYS SO JEWS CAN'T PARTICIPATE, WE ATTEMPT TO PASS
RESOLUTION WITH ONE SIDED LANGUAGE, WE ATTEMPT TO PASS
RESOLUTIONS ABOUT CONTRACTS THAT ARE WE ATTEMPT TO PASS
OMNIBUS RESOLUTION, WE ARE SHUTTING DOWN A COMMUNAL PATH
FORWARD. WE SHUT DOWN ENGAGEMENT AND WE DIVIDE OUR
COMMUNITY AND WE ARE SIGNALLING TO AGGRESSORS THAT THE ACTIONS
ARE AGO. PLEASE VOTE AGAINST IT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO NEXT PERSON?
>> CAN WE TRY STEVEN ONE MORE TIME?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YES. THEN TO ELON. STEVE AND THEN ELON?
>> OKAY. I'M STEVE. RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE LIVING ON J STREET. I
OPPOSE TO THE POLICY ORDERS. 129 PROMOTES A HATE GROUP CALLED
AMERICAN MUSLIMS FOR PALESTINE. SPREAD ANTIRACISM AND CALLS FOR
ISRAELI TO BE BOMBED. THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULDN'T ALIGN ITSELF WITH
HATE GROUPS. 109, IT IS PART OF THE GLOBAL BDS MOVEMENT. THE
PURPOSE IS NOT TO PROTEST THE SO CALLED OCCUPATION OR CHANGE
POLICY, IT IS TO ISOLATE AND PRESSURE ISRAEL UNTIL IT WILL CEASE TO
EXIST. IT IS ECONOMIC WARFARE AT ITS WORST. THIS IS A FARM OF
ANTISEMITISM. TO QUOTE, PEOPLE CRITICIZE ZIONISM, THEY MEAN JEWS.
YOU TALK ANTISEMITISM. IT VIOLATES THE POLICY BECAUSE THIS MAKES

JEWS AND ISRAELIS FEEL UNWELCOME. IT WILL MAKE ME FEEL UNSAFE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT?
>> CONSIDERING THE WHITE SUPREMACIST IN AMERICAN POLITICS,
CONSIDERING THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT, TRAINING AND INTELLIGENCE
TO LOCAL POLICE FORCE BY OUR MILITARY, CONSIDERING THE USE OF LOCAL
POLICE FOR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING BY THE SECURITY STATES, VIOLENCE
EMBEDDED IN THE SYSTEM, AND CONSIDERING THE POLICE FORCE AND
UNACCOUNTABLE FOR THE KILLING OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR.
CONSIDERING THE UNITED STATES HAS ALLOWED THE PRISON POPULATION
COMPOSE MOSTLY OF BLACK AND BROWN. I URGE YOU TO HOLD US ALL
ACCOUNTABLE. DIVEST FROM ALL COMPANIES, AMAZON, MICROSOFT, GM,
HELPING THE FEDERAL STATE AND CITY GOVERNMENT TO SUSTAIN THE
OPPRESSION OF BLACK, BROWN, INDIGENOUS, IMMIGRANT, AND LGBTQ
PEOPLE. TAKE SUPPORT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP. BACK TO ROBIN?
>> HI. SOUTH ASIAN IMMIGRANT AND A RESIDENT FOR OVER TEN YEARS. I
SPEAK STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE POLICY ORDERS. AND BOTH
RESOLUTIONS SUPPORT THE RIGHT FOR SELF DETERMINATION. SUPPORTS
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE DISPOSSESSED OF THE LAND AND DREAMS AND
RESISTING ETHNIC CLEANSING FOR 73 YEARS BY THE SUPPOSED DEMOCRATIC
APARTHEID STATE. 114 WILL SUPPORT THE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN
CAMBRIDGE, WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY RACIST AND CLASSISM POLICING
SYSTEM. I FIND THEY ARE PRONOUNCING ON WHAT PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
SHOULD DO OR WANTING FOR THEIR MOVEMENT. AND NOT MENTIONING
POLICY ORDER 114, IT IS ALSO THE DISCUSSION AND VERY MUCH
INTERCONNECTED TO 109. I SUPPORT THE DEMAND OF THE COMMUNITIES.
I URGE CAMBRIDGE TO DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: MIRIAM?
>> I PLEAD WITH YOU, I'M A FORMER CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, I PLEAD WITH
YOU TO VOTE NO ON THE ORDER. IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT VIOLENCE, IN
NEW YORK AND L.A., AND ANTI JEWISH SLURS HAILED AT CHILDREN, DUE TO
THE HATRED OF ISRAEL, WHICH SPILLED OVER TO ANTISEMITISM, IF YOU PASS
THIS, IT IS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL TO HAVE MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST JEWS IN
CAMBRIDGE AND ELSEWHERE IN BOSTON.
THIS RESOLUTION IS DIVISIVE. IT IGNORES THE FACT IF PEOPLE REALLY CARE
ABOUT PALESTINIANS, THEY WOULD GET RID OF HAMAS. CARE ABOUT THE
FACT THAT HAMAS CONVERTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GIVEN
THROUGH HUMANITARIAN AID TO BUILD HOSPITALS AND OTHER
INFRASTRUCTURE INSTEAD OF SPENT IT ON MISSILES AGAINST ISRAEL AND
CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PRESSING THE PALESTINIAN S.

THE LAST NINE YEARS. I'M ISRAELI JEW AND CITIZEN. I URGE YOU TO REJECT
THE POLICY ORDER. IF THE RESOLUTION PASSES, I WILL FEEL UNSAFE AND
UNWELCOMED AND VICTIMIZE IN THE CITY THAT I'M PROUD TO CALL HOME
FOR NINE YEARS. SINCE THIS RESOLUTION OFFERS AN ENTIRELY ONE SIDED
PERSPECTIVE AND MAKES NO MENTION OF THE RIGHTS OF ISRAELI CITIZENS
NOT TO BE ATTACKED BY HAMAS FIRE ROCKETS, I FEEL PERSONALLY ISRAELI
CITIZEN HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT VALUED OR RESPECTED BY THE
RESOLUTION. THE ACTIONS OF HAMAS AND INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, THEY ARE BEING IGNORED. VILIFYING ONE SIDE
AND SHOWING THE OTHER AS THE VICTIM, THIS RESOLUTION DOES A
DISSERVICE TO COMPLEX AND TRAGIC SITUATION FACED BY ISRAELI AND
PALESTINIANS BY DISREGARDING THE SITUATION, THIS RESOLUTION SERVES
ONLY TO INTENSIFY FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION AND MAKE IT'S
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON? PHILIP?
>> HELLO. I'M READING A STATEMENT FROM PHILIP. IN SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDER. I AM A LONG TIME CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND TAXPAYER.
I'M A HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY AWARE JEWISH PERSON. I DON'T
SUPPORT THE CRUELTY OF THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. THEIR LATEST
ATTACKS AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ON TOP OF ONGOING
PERSECUTION THERE IN THE WEST BANK AND IN ISRAELI WILL BRING MORE
DESTRUCTION TO AN ONGOING WAR BETWEEN TWO SIBLING PEOPLES. THE
ISRAELI HAVE THE UPPER HAND. MILITARY THEY DOMINATE THE LIVES OF
PALESTINIANS WITH OVERT WARFARE AND HOUSE DEMOLITIONS, AND LAND
OCCUPATION. REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WRONG EVEN THOUGH
EVERYBODY CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE. I URGE THE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THE
POLICY ORDER 109 AND CEASE DOING BUSINESS WITH HP BECAUSE OF THE
SALES OF EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS TO ISRAEL AS WELL AS ICE AND OUR
OWN COUNTRY.
>> YES. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE. I'M HERE TO VOICE MY SUPPORT OF POLICY
ORDER 109 AND 114. I WANT TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON ENDING
BUSINESS WITH HP UNTIL THE COMPANY STOPS SUPPORTING OPPRESSION
AND HUMAN RIGHTS. MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN IMMIGRANT IN PALESTINE.
THE PALESTINIAN THAT PROTECTED MY FATHER'S RIGHT ARE TODAY FACING
DISCRIMINATION AND INHUMANE TREATMENT WITH THE ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT AN ARAB CONFLICT, NOT A RELIGIOUS CONFLICT,
NOR AN ANTISemitic CAMPAIGN, IT IS ABOUT COLONIALISM AND THE
GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONALIZED BY VIOLENCE AGAINST PALESTINIANS. I
URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR 114 TO BUILD SAFETY FOR BLACK AND BROWN
COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU.
>> SARAH HAS NOT JOINED. BILL. GO AHEAD.
>> ALL RIGHT. I SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS 114 AND 109. I HAVE
SOMETHING PERSONAL TO SAY TO 109. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR OVER 55
YEARS, I GREW UP IN HAMPTON BEACH, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE
RESTRICTIONS PRESENTED JEWS FROM PURCHASING REAL ESTATE. WHILE
JEWS WERE NOT WELCOMED IN OUR TOWN, I HEARD ADULTS EXPRESS
ADMIRATION AND SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE

PAGE 91

May 24, 2021

JEW SEEM TO BE FOND OF THE SO CALLED JEWISH STATE. TO BE HONEST, I
COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND EITHER ATTITUDE AND I STILL CAN'T. THANK
GOD AT LEAST RACE BASED DEED RESTRICTIONS ARE NO LONGER USED IN THE
COUNTRY. IRONICALLY, THEY STILL ARE IN ISRAEL. I DON'T THINK ISRAEL IS
SINGLED OUT IN THE CASE, THIS COUNTRY HAS SANCTIONS AGAINST MANY
OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAS DISCUSSED EVERY COUNTRY
ON EARTH AND CONDEMN MOST OF THEM.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. THAT'S TIME. NEXT, WE HEAR FROM
JOHN.
>> HI. I LIVE AT 218 THORNDIKE STREET IN EAST CAMBRIDGE. I HAD THE
HONOR OF PLAYING A ROLE IN THE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE APARTHEID.
CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE OPPOSED TO THE RESOLUTION HAD
TO SAY, I THINK WE CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN THAT CONFLICT. IN
THE OVERTHROW OF THE APARTHEID THAT EXIST IN ISRAEL BY PASSING 109. I
HEARD A LOT TONIGHT THAT SOUNDED VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD
WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING AGAINST APARTHEID IN AFRICA. THEY SAID THE
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA WAS THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC STATE IN AFRICA.
WHY DO YOU SINGLE US OUT? LOOK AT THE SOVIET UNION, LOOK AT CHINA.
ALL THE EXCUSES. WE SAW WHAT IT REALLY WAS. THE GOVERNMENT
SUPPORTED IT, WE DEFEATED THEM.
>> THAT'S TIME. NEXT IS STACIA.
>> HI. I'M CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND JEWISH AMERICAN. I URGE YOU TO
SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS. OPPONENTS WILL FRAME THE MOVEMENT AS
ANTISemitic. I WILL REMIND YOU, ZIONISM IS A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND A
NATIONALIST MOVEMENT WITH FUNDING BY AMERICAN CONSERVATIVES
AND PRACTICED BY A FAR RIGHT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. WHEN A COUNTRY IS
CREATED BY DISPLACING INDIGENOUS POPULATION AS ISRAEL WAS IN 1948,
IT DETERMINES THE ITS OWN FATE. IT USES VIOLENCE AND PR TO LEGITIMIZE
ITSELF. THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE ALLIES ARE USING THE VERY
REAL PERSECUTION OF JEWS TO FRAME ITSELF AS A POLITICAL UNDERDOG. IF
I WALK INTO SOMEONE'S HOUSE, BRUTALIZE THEM, I WOULDN'T CLAIM
ANTISEMITISM OR DIVISIVENESS WHEN THE NEIGHBORS REFUSE TO LEND ME
SUGAR. YOU MUST LISTEN TO AND FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF ACTIVISTS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT IS ANNA. GO AHEAD.
>> HELLO. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF CAMBRIDGE
FOR 13 YEARS. I'M NOW DEEPLY CONCERNED. I OPPOSE THE PROPOSALS.
I'M SHOCKED THAT THE COUNCIL HEARD THE RESOLUTION LAST WEEK. THIS
IS ONE WAY IT IS ANTISemitic. IT IS HURTFUL. CITY MANAGER FOR FISCAL
AFFAIRS CONFIRMED THAT CAMBRIDGE HAS NOT CONTRACTED WITH HP
SINCE 2014. IF YOU BELIEVE ISRAEL IS WRONG, WHY DON'T CALL OUT OTHER
COUNTRIES. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE ALL WANT PEACE. IF THE COUNCIL
WANTS TO TAKE A STAND, IT SHOULD OFFER PEACEFUL LEADERSHIP. NOT
FOCUS ON JUST ISRAEL.
(INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING).

I'M SCARED ABOUT HOW RESOLUTIONS WILL INFLAME THE DANGEROUS
SAFETY AND FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY. REJECT THE ONE SIDED
RESOLUTION WHICH I'M NOT POISED TO LEAD TO PIECE OR REPRESENT THE
INCLUSION THAT THE CITY HOLDS DEAR. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KATHERINE IS NOT JOINED OR NO LONGER ON ZOOM.
MARSHA GO AHEAD. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. (SILENCE) NEXT PERSON.
>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE
POLICY ORDER REGARDING THE CITY'S CONTRACT WITH HP. AND THE
COMPANIES I'M A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND I WANT TO URGE YOU TO
VOTE YES ON THE POLICY TO END BUSINESS TIES WITH HP ENTERPRISE UNTIL
THE COMPANY STOPS SUPPORTING OPPRESSION AND THE VIOLATION OF
HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
THE CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP ON HUMAN AND CIVIL
RIGHTS, FROM THE GLARING 1985 TO CUTTING BUSINESS TIES WITH
POLAROID AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE 1970S AND 1980S. BRINGING THE
CITY'S INVESTMENT AND CONTRACT PRACTICES IN LINE WITH THE
ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS, IT IS JUST ONE STEP FORWARD TO THOSE WHO
BENEFIT AND PROFIT AND THE VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS. THANK YOU.
>> NEXT WE HEAR FROM DANIEL.
>> HELLO. I'M PH.D. STUDENT AT MIT. I URGE THE COUNCIL TO VOTE YES
ON THE POLICY ORDERS. I BELIEVE IT AS A JEWISH AMERICAN, I HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY TO CALL OUT THE OCCUPATION, ETHNIC CLEANSING AND THE
APART TIED BEING THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. HP IS A COMPANY
IMPLICATED IN THE MILITARY OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE AND ISRAELI
APARTHEID. BOYCOTTING THEM AND OTHER COMPANY THAT FACILITATES
DISCRIMINATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IS A NECESSARY NONVIOLENT
STEP FOR THE CITY, STATE, AND COUNTRY TO TAKE IN THE INTEREST OF CIVIL
RIGHTS. ISRAEL NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACTION, SO ISRAELI
AND PALESTINIANS CAN MOVE FORWARD TOWARD A JUSTICE AND LASTING
JUST AND LASTING PIECE. I EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR POLICY ORDER OF 114
AND REJECT MILITARIZE POLICING. THANK YOU.
>> NEXT IS SARAH. GO AHEAD.
>> HI. THANK YOU. I'M SARAH. I LIVE AT 129 FRANKLIN STREET. I
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AS LAST WEEK I WAS UNABLE TO.
AND I APPRECIATE THE COUNCIL FOR STAYING LATE TO HEAR EVERY VOICE.
I'M HERE AS A RESIDENT AND AN AMERICAN AND ISRAELI TO EXPRESS
OPPOSITION. I HEARD MANY PEOPLE NOT CURRENTLY FROM CAMBRIDGE,
WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENCOURAGE THE CITY TO PASS THE MEASURE AS
A POLITICAL MEDIA STATEMENT. DESPITE THE FACT IT HAS NO AFFECT ON
THEM. I'M SHOCKED IT IS BEING DEBATED. IT IS ONE SIDED ON THE ISSUE
THAT IS ANYTHING BUT CLEAR CUT. AND THE IMPORTANT IS TO DEMONIZE
ISRAEL BASED ON THE POLITICAL OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. IT
DOESN'T PROMOTE PEACE. THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES, I'M FOR
DISCUSSION. IT IS ALIENATING MANY JEWS AND MAKING US FEEL

PAGE 93

May 24, 2021

UNWELCOME AND UNSAFE. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A PLACE. I
ENCOURAGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE THE COMMUNITY OF CAMBRIDGE. PLEASE
VOTE NO.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON?
>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> HELLO. I READ ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE. I GREW UP GOING TO THE
ISLAMIC SOCIETY OF BOSTON ON PROSPECT STREET. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT
THE ORDER. MY LIFE, CAMBRIDGE HAS BEEN A NATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL
LEADER ON TAKING A STAND ON HUMAN RIGHTS. AS THE CITY TOOK A
CHANCE AGAINST APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA, A FEW DECADES AGO, IT
SHOULD TAKE ACTION AGAINST APARTHEID IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL. IT
PROFITS FROM THE OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIANS. ISRAEL MAINTAINS AN
ETHNO STATE. HP IS A PROVIDER OF THE SERVICE AND NOW IS THE TIME FOR
CAMBRIDGE TO CUT ALL DIRECT AND INDIRECT TIES WITH THIS ILLEGAL
REGIME OF OPPRESSION. AND LASTLY, I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH AN
INDIVIDUAL WHO SAID I WILL WELCOME THAT...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOING TO MICHAEL.
>> OKAY. LIVING IN FIVE MEMORIAL DRIVE. I SPEAK AGAINST THE POLICY
ORDER. PROUD CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BE SO.
PASSING THIS WILL DO NOTHING TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND WILL
SUPPORT THE HAMAS, A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AGAINST THE ISRAEL
RIGHT TO EXIST. TO SEE THEM FROM THEIR HOME AND KILLED, SAY NOTHING
AT ALL ABOUT HOW THE RESPONSES BEGAN. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE
HARD BORDERS HAD BEEN IS A RESULT OF PALESTINIAN TERRORISM IN
2002, WHICH RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF ISRAELI DEAD. THE RHETORIC AND
COMMENTS THAT SOME SPEAKERS WERE NOT GROUNDED IN REALITY.
ISRAEL IS NOT A WHITE SUPREMACIST POWER, ISRAEL IS NOT AN APARTHEID
STATE, IT DOES NEED A PARTNER FOR PEACE. AND I HOPE YOU INVITE
EXPERTS TO WEIGH IN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP, WE HAVE MICHAEL.
>> THANK YOU. LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE CLOSE TO TEN YEARS. I WILL VOICE MY
SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY ORDERS. DOING BETTER BY OUR FELLOW CITIZENS
GOES WITH TRYING TO DO BETTER AS CITIZENS OF THE WORD. I HAVE HEARD
WILD ARGUMENTS. HP DOESN'T EQUAL THE ISRAELI ECONOMY. NOBODY IS
TRYING TO DESTROY ISRAELI. WE ARE ASKING YOU TO NOT DO BUSINESS
WITH A COMPANY THAT SUPPORTS THE ONGOING ILLEGAL OCCUPATION. IT
IS THAT SIMPLE. IF YOU CLAIM ISRAEL IS BEING SINGLED OUT, I WOULD SAY,
THIS IS A STRONGMAN ARGUMENT. THEY HAVE PASSED POLICY IN DIRECT
OPPOSITION TO OTHER COUNTRIES OF HUMAN RIGHTS. NOT JUST ISRAEL. IN
MARCH, THERE WAS A ORDINANCE TO SUPPORT THE FARMER'S PROTEST IN
INDIA. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON?
>> HELLO. I'M AMIR. I SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. ON THE
HEART PROGRAM. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL ON STAYING UP SO LATE. LAST

WEEK AND THIS WEEK, LISTENING TO TESTIMONY BEFORE YOU START THE
MEETING. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HAVE A WELL FORMULATED OPINION ON
ISRAEL AND PALESTINE. YOU DO HAVE TO VOTE ON IT NOW AND NO MATTER
HOW YOU WILL VOTE, YOU WILL UPSET MANY PEOPLE. TAKE A STAND BASED
ON PRINCIPLES AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE. REENFORCE ONE THING YOU
ALREADY FEEL DEEP IN YOUR HEART. BOYCOTTING IS A PEACEFUL, LEGAL,
AND LEGITIMATE MEANS TO OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION AND OPPRESSION.
WHEN THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THEY ARE MALIGNED BY PEOPLE THAT
BENEFITTED. YOU SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THIS.
BOYCOTTING IS ABOUT ANTISemitic.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. ONE MOMENT. I'M READING A TESTIMONY FOR PAMELA, WHO
LIVES AT 36 WHOLEWORTHY STREET. A PROUD LIFE LONG RESIDENT OF
CAMBRIDGE, FULLY INVESTED IN COMMUNITY AND WANTING TO BE SAFE
PLACE POSSIBLE FOR ALL. I SUPPORT BOTH POLICY ORDERS 109 AND POLICY
ORDER 114 AS WELL AS POLICY ORDER 129. I WANT THE CITY POLICY TO BE
CONSISTENT WITH THE VISION AND VALUES. AS A 17 YEAR OLD LESBIAN WHO
EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION AND VIOLENCE, I WANT TO CONTINUE TO LIVE
HERE IN CAMBRIDGE WITHOUT THE THREAT OF HARASSMENT OR JUDGMENT.
I HOPE THE SAME FOR ANY PERSON IN THE CITY AND AS A FORMER TEACHER
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, I FEEL STRONGLY THAT OUR CITIES ADOLESCENTS
MUST BE PROTECTED SURVEILLANCE AND VIOLENCE. PLEASE ADOPT BOTH
THE POLICY ORDERS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT IS LUCAS.
>> HI. 1948, MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED IN PALESTINE. I SAY 1948, AS 1949
LIVED AS A REFUGEE IN LEBANON. ISRAELI FORCES CAME TO MY FAMILY
FARM, GAVE THEM FIVE MINUTES TO PACK. THEY TOLD THEM PLAINLY,
BECAUSE THEY WERE ARAB, THEY COULD NO LONGER LIVE THERE. MY
FAMILY WAS THE VICTIM OF GENOCIDE WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER WAS TEN.
AND IT SHOWS IN THE WAY IT EXISTS TODAY. IT IS NOW A MAJORITY ISRAELI
CITY, WITH THE ARAB POPULATION MOSTLY REMOVED. SO, I'M SAYING
PLAINLY... TO ALL THOSE THAT DENY THE EXISTING APARTHEID STATE, MY
FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCED IT AND SO SUPPORT 109 AND ALSO 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. NEXT UP?
>> CAN WE CALL ENZO. THEY ARE BACK ON.
>> I'M JEWISH AND SPEND MOST HOLIDAYS IN CAMBRIDGE. I DIDN'T TESTIFY
LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAY. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE POLICY
ORDER 109 AND 114. I'M FROM HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR SOCIAL SECURITY. I
WENT ON BIRTH RIGHT AFTER COLLEGE AND SHOCKED TO MY CORE THAT THE
FASCISM THAT KILLED MY FAMILY AND 2019 TO SEE THE APARTHEID. IT IS
NOT COMPLICATED. IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO LEARN THE TRUTH.
SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINIAN AND BLACK NEIGHBORS IS SAFETY AND WHAT
IS JEWISH TO ME. MY COMMUNITY IS AFRAID OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. WE
ARE AFRAID TO BE VOCAL ABOUT THE MORAL CLARITY OF OPPRESSION. IF
WE WERE NOT AFRAID, THERE WOULD BE HUNDREDS TO SIGN LETTERS.

PAGE 95

May 24, 2021

PASSING THEM WILL CONTROL RELIEF FOR JEWS WHO ARE AFRAID TO TESTIFY
IN FAVOR OF POLICY ORDERS 109 AND 114. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP, I THINK JEANNINE IS BACK?
>> FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT. SORRY. I LIVED ON RIVER STREET FOR NEARLY
30 YEARS. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE POLICY ORDER 114, WHICH WOULD ASK
THE CITY MANAGER TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE HEART PROGRAM. THE
HOLISTIC AND EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE TEAM PROGRAM, WHICH
IS DEVELOPED BY A WIDE RANGE OF CAMBRIDGE GROUPS, INCLUDING
YOUNG PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE HEAVILY POLICED. IT HAS
RESPONSE TEAMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, CONFLICT RESOLUTION
TEAMS, RESPONSE TEAMS TO HELP PEOPLE SUFFERING ALCOHOL AND DRUG
INDUCED CRISIS AND POST CRISIS FOLLOW UP TEAMS. ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT FEATURES, IT WILL EMPLOY TRAIN AND EMPLOY MEMBERS
YOUTH, ESPECIALLY OF THE HEART RESPONSE TEAM. I URGE YOU TO VOTE
YES ON PO 14 AND I FEEL LIKE
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. JONAH?
>> HELLO. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT 109 AND 114. I'M A CAMBRIDGE JEW AND
PROUD OF THE MY UPBRINGING IN CAMBRIDGE, WHICH INFORM MY
SUPPORT FOR THE MEASURES. THE COUNCIL SAYING YES WILL BE PROUD TO
BE CAMBRIDGE. THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND FRANKLY EMOTIONAL
MANIPULATION ABOUT WHAT BDS IS. IT IS THREE SIMPLE DEMANDS.
ENDING THE OCCUPATION, EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL, AND THE RIGHT OF
RETURN FOR POLICY AND REFUGEES IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND
THE CONDITIONS SET BY THE UN IN 1949 FOR THE MEMBERSHIP. HERE IS A
CONCRETE PATH TO PEACE AND JUSTICE, IF YOU DON'T PURSUE IT, YOU
OFFER NOTHING BUT WORDS. IT IS NOT COMPLEX, BUT A SIMPLE ONE OF
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. YOU DON'T NEED TO AN EXPERT TO UNDERSTAND
THAT. BOTH SHOWS CAMBRIDGE PUTS IT'S MONEY WHERE ITS MOUTH IS
WHEN IT COMES TO VALUES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> HELLO. I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDERS. WHEN
OPPONENTS ASK YOU SINGLE OUT ISRAELI, YOU RESPOND I'M NOT. I REFUSE
TO SINGLE THEM OUT BY HOLDING THEM TO A LOWER STANDARD THAN
THAT WHICH THE CITY HELD GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
ADDITIONALLY, POLICY ORDER NUMBER 109 WILL TARGET UNITED STATES
CRIMES, IN ADDITION TO THE ISRAELI CRIME. ISRAELI COMPANIES THAT
PROVIDE SURVEILLANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SURVEILLING MIGRANTS
ALONG THE BORDER. WE KNOW THE SAME COMPANIES PROFIT FROM
OPPRESSION AND ISRAELI AND PALESTINE AND ELSEWHERE. I WILL SPEAK MY
SUPPORT FOR 114. WE CAN'T PASS ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. WE HAVE TO
WORK TO DISMANTLE THE VIOLENT POLICING. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP IS LUCAS?
>> WE HEARD FROM HIM.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M A PHYSICIAN, WHO LIVED ON MASS AVENUE FOR

TEN YEARS. I OPPOSE 109. I'M DISAPPOINTED THE COUNCIL IS SPENDING SO
MUCH TIME ON THIS ISSUE, WHICH IS NOT OWN UNETHICAL AND
UNNECESSARY INCENDIARY. I AND MY COLLEAGUES RELY ON ISRAELI
INNOVATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS. THE
PROPOSED POLICY THREATENS MY SAFETY AS A JEW IN CAMBRIDGE,
AFFIRMING THE HAMAS ARCHITECTURE OF DEATH AND THREATENS THE WELL
BEING OF ALL PATIENTS AT LOCAL HOSPITALS WHO BENEFIT FROM ISRAELI
INNOVATION. I INVITE ALL OF THOSE WHO CALLED FOR BDS TO CONSIDER
WHAT NOT SPEAK AGAINST THE MORE IMMEDIATE INJUSTICE, THE
GENOCIDE, THAT DENIES RIGHT TO ALL MINORITIES AND USING PUBLIC
SQUARES TO LYNCH PEOPLE, JEWS, LGBTQ PEOPLE, ET CETERA.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP?
>> PAULA.
>> THANK YOU. I SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ALL PEOPLE AND BECAUSE
OF THIS, I ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. I CAN SPEAK ON THE ONE
SIDED NATURE AS IF ALL BLAME BELONGS ON ISRAEL AND NOT ON HAMAS,
WHICH THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION THAT IS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
LEADERSHIP IN GAZA. CAN I SAY WHILE IT IS TRUE YOU CAN OPPOSE ISRAEL
WITHOUT RESORTING TO ANTI SEMITISM, BDS DOES NOT AND HAS NOT AND
OPENING THE DOOR TO HATE IN THIS COMMUNITY. I CAN TALK ABOUT HOW
THEY HARM THE PEOPLE IT PROPOSES TO HELP SINCE IT IS SHOWN TO RESULT
IN FURTHER ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS FOR THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WHO
DESERVE SO MUCH MORE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE NOW. I WILL SAY, THE
PROFESSORS IN GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT DON'T SEEM
TO REALIZE IN ADDITION TO THE PRESIDENTS AND GOVERNORS, THE PARENT
UNION FOR MANY ACADEMICS NATIONWIDE, INCLUDING HARVARD, HAVE
COME OUT AGAINST THE BDS MOVEMENT BECAUSE WILL PREVENT FREE
TRADE AND ENDORSES POLITICAL AGENDA THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY AND
STIFLES FREEDOM
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU. SAMUEL?
>> UNMUTE YOURSELF. SAMUEL IS NOT ON OR CANNOT UNMUTE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: HEATHER HOFFMAN? ARE YOU THERE? I SEE YOU.
>> AM I ON?
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: SAMUEL AND THEN HEATHER.
>> I'M SURPRISED IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF HARVARD AND MIT TO HEAR SO
MANY GENERALIZED INSULTS AND CRITICISMS OFF ISRAEL. NONE OF THE EVIL
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE BIAS UN AND HUMAN
RIGHTS GROUPS OF THE MEDIA. DO YOU KNOW THIS? HAVE YOU LIVED IN
PALESTINE OR BELIEVE ALL THE STORIES YOU HEAR WITHOUT DOING DUE
DILIGENCE? (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING). I'M
SURPRISED THERE'S NO REFERENCE TO THE 1990 ACCORD. IT CREATED A
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WITH RULE OVER ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF THE 95%
OF WEST BANK PALESTINIANS AND ENDED ANY OCCUPATION. ISRAEL
REMAINED IN CHARGE OF OVERALL SECURITY. THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN

THE PARTIES THEMSELVES WILL SUPERSEDED RUINS BY INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> 213 HURLEY STREET AND I WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT. FIRST, I'M GOING
TO ASK YOU TO PUT THE PETITION REGARDING NEIGHBORHOOD
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS ON FILE. THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE HAS
ALREADY TOLD US THEY ARE OVERWHELMED WITH WORK AND THIS IS A
VANITY PROJECT SO SOMEONE CAN INDULGE HIS OFTEN STATED AND OFTEN
ABUSIVE DISLIKE FOR THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORICAL COMMISSION AND
PROTECTION OF OUR LOCAL ARCHITECTURE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
RECOGNIZING OLDER AMERICANS MONTH. BEING I'M AN OLDER AMERICAN.
AND I HOPE YOU COME OUT AGAINST THE AGEISM THAT I HAVE HEARD
WAY TOO MUCH OF IN THE SULLIVAN CHAMBER AND EXPRESSED AND
CHEERED BY MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. I HOPE THAT OUR VALUES DO NOT
INCLUDE THE BULLYING THAT I HAVE HEARD WAY TOO MUCH OF. THANK
YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT PERSON?
>> GOOD EVENING. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE BDS
RESOLUTION ON DEBATE. THE RESOLUTIONS SINGLE OUT ISRAEL FOR
UNIQUE PROGRAM FOR DOING NOTHING MORE THAN DEFENDING ITSELF
AGAINST THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION HAMAS. AN ORGANIZATION WHO
CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL BY MURDER AND WAR. AND RULES
THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA WITH AN IRON FIST. APART FROM THE INJUSTICE
FROM THE RESOLUTION, IT PROVIDES MORAL COVER TO ANTISemitic
VIOLENCE WHICH IS ONGOING IN CITIES ACROSS AMERICA. JEWS ARE BEAT
UP, JEWS RUN DOWN IN THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES, AND LOUD SPEAKERS
BLARING ACROSS THE TOWN IN LONDON... I THINK THAT IS THE MOST
RELEVANT POINT AND KEEPING JEWS SAFE REQUIRES YOU TO VOTE NO.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: KIT?
>> HI. I LIVED IN CAMBRIDGE TEN YEARS AND I LIVE AT HAZEL STREET. I'M
ASKING YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE POLICY ORDERS. AS A CITIZEN, I ASK YOU
TO (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING). AS AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, I'M ASKING YOU TO DIVEST FROM HP. TAKE ACTION ON ANYTHING
TO SINGLE IT OUT, ALL HARD DECISIONS MAKE PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE. I
OPPOSE THE HP... (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID SPEAKING/READING). IT
DIDN'T CHANGE THE DISCRIMINATION THAT IS HERE. I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE
PERSON SAY WHAT HP DOES IS OKAY. IT IS NOT OKAY. SAYING THIS A TWO
SIDED ISSUE WILL CHANGE TO JEWISH CITIZEN
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. WHO IS NEXT?
>> ADAM.
>> HELLO. I LIVE OFF OF HARVARD SQUARE. I WILL VOICE MY OPPOSITION
TO THE RESOLUTION AND SUPPORT FOR PROJECT HEART. I APPRECIATE
WHAT EVERYBODY SAID. I HEARD MULTIPLE MEMBERS SPEAK ABOUT


PAGE 98

May 24, 2021

FEELING UNSAFE, ESPECIALLY RECENTLY DUE TO RISE OF ANTIRACISM.
PERSONALLY, I WALK MY TODDLER TO SCHOOL. THE PRE SCHOOL LOCATION
MEANS NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD FEEL UNSAFE SHOWING
RELIGION. NOBODY IN CAMBRIDGE SHOULD FEEL UNSAFE. NO PRE SCHOOL
SHOULD REQUIRE GUARDS. IMAGINE IF YOU DID NOT FEEL SAFE WALKING
YOUR TODDLER TO SCHOOL TWO BLOCKS FROM HOME. THAT'S THE
DECISION BEFORE YOU TODAY. COMMUNAL SAFETY, I AGREE WITH PROJECT
HEART AND HOPE YOU PASS THAT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: UP NEXT?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME? I LIVE ON CAMBRIDGE STREET AND HERE TO STATE
MY SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY ORDERS BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT
OPPRESSIVE MILITARY POLICING ABROAD OR AT HOME. I NOTICE TESTIMONY
IS HUMAN RIGHTS ARGUING AGAINST 109. AS SOMEONE WHO IS VERY
FAMILIAR, THERE ARE MANY PARALLELS BETWEEN THE ISRAELI APARTHEID
AND THE ETHNIC CLEANSING. (INDISCERNIBLE DUE TO RAPID
SPEAKING/READING).
WE SHOULD NOW STAND SOLIDARITY WITH PALESTINE AND HAS TO BE
GLOBAL. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL
INVESTMENT. HP IS A CORPORATION, CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PEOPLE.
PALESTINIANS ARE PEOPLE. THE CITY COUNCIL HAS A DUTY TO CAMBRIDGE
RESIDENTS SO PLEASE VOTE YES.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PEOPLE IN FRONT
ME.
>> THIS CONCLUDES PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNED UP. I THINK THERE ARE A
FEW HANDS TO RECALL. JOAN? YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.
>> THANK YOU. I SPEAK TONIGHT AS A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, LIVING ON
PLYMOUTH STREET. I HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 1982. AND WHAT I REMEMBER
MOST STARTLING, STUDENTS AT THE GROUP SCHOOL WHERE I WORKED,
THEY WERE CLEAR THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT DONATION FROM POLAROID.
THE HUMAN RIGHTS STRUGGLE GO ON AND I ASK THE COUNCILLORS TO
DIVEST OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY, INCLUDING HP FROM ANY POINT OF THE
CONTRACTS. HP IS BENEFITTING FROM THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IN
CALIFORNIA, FROM THE BORDER PATROL WITH ICE AND THE SURVEILLANCE
IN PALESTINE. I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON CAMBRIDGE TO CONTINUE WITH
THE INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS IN SO MANY AREAS. AND
THIS WILL BE A CHANCE FOR PALESTINIAN VOICES TO BE HEARD AND
CAMBRIDGE ON THE FOREFRONT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU.
>> NEXT IS HANNAH. YOUR VERSION OF ZOOM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. WE
CAN'T UNMUTE YOU UNTIL IT IS UPDATED.
>> I BELIEVE WE MISSED MARSHA? GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU. BDS CAMPAIGNS ARE A LEGITIMATE FORM OF PROTEST IF
THEY ARE NOT DISCRIMINATORY AND IF THEY DON'T CHALLENGE THE


PAGE 99

May 24, 2021

LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE ITSELF. THE BDS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISRAEL FAILS
TO MEET THE CRITERIA AND I OPPOSE THE PROPOSALS. WHY IS THE CITY OF
CAMBRIDGE TARGETING ISRAEL WITH THE BDS CAMPAIGN AND NOT OTHER
COUNTRIES THAT IS ENGAGED IN SIMILAR CONDUCT. WHY ARE NOT
ADVOCATING FOR IT AGAINST RUSSIA FOR THE ASSAULT OF PEOPLE IN
UKRAINE TERRITORY OR TO CHINA. AND IF WE WANT TO DENOUNCE HUMAN
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, WE SHOULD HAVE CRITICISMS OF HAMAS.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: YOUR TIME IS UP. I DON'T THINK JOYCE SIGNED UP
FROM MY LIST.
>> NO, THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY SIGNED UP.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: CONFIRMING WHETHER THE HANDS THAT ARE UP
SIGNED UP. I THINK THOMAS WAS SIGNED UP AND WE SKIPPED HIM.
>> GO AHEAD.
>> YOU CAN HEAR ME? OKAY. I WENT TO GAZA IN SUMMER OF 2009.
WHAT I SAW THERE IS BEYOND DESCRIPTION. I SAW WHAT THEY MEAN BY
ISRAELI PEACE AND ISRAELI SAFETY. THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A
SEWERAGE TREATMENT FACILITY DESTROYED. HOSPITALS THAT ARE
BOMBED. SCHOOLS AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS BOMBED. BOOKSTORES
AND SHOPS, GRAVES OVERTURNED. I MET A WOMEN FROM A FAMILY WHO
HAD 49 MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY DIE IN A SINGLE NIGHT. YOU CAN LOOK IT
UP. ON HER HOME, I SAW ISRAELI GRAFFITI WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND
HEBREW, DEATH TO ARABS, DEATH TO ALL. THE ONLY GOOD ARAB IS A
DEATH ARAB. ET CETERA. THIS IS WHAT ISRAEL MEANS BY PEACE. THIS IS
HOW THEY TREAT THE PEOPLE OF GAZA AND WE HAVE TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL
UNTIL THIS ENDS!
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: WE ARE GOING TO LIZA. WE MAY HAVE SKIPPED YOU.
>> I ALREADY SPOKE IN FAVOR OF 109 AND 114.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: GOT IT. NEXT PERSON.
>> HELLO. I SUPPORT POLICY ORDER 109 AND 114. I LIVE IN CAMBRIDGE.
MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE END THE COMPLICIT AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE
THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND CORPORATIONS, WHICH CONTINUE TO SUPPORT
INCARCERATION, SEGREGATION, DESTRUCTION, FOR PROFIT? THE LIVES OF
PALESTINIANS, THE LIFE OF ALL OVER OUR OWN LIVES. LIVES HAVE TO BE
VALUED. WHAT HAPPENS ABROAD HAPPENS AT HOME. HOW DO WE
CONFRONT VIOLENCE OF THE RACIAL TARGETING SURVEILLANCE AS FAMILIES
ARE DYING IN PALESTINE. HOW DO WE RESPECT DIFFERENCES AND THE
SAME TIME RESPECT SINGLE BUSINESS AS USUAL CAN'T BE ACCEPTED. IT IS
OUR RESPONSIBILITY...
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT. NEXT UP?
>> AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THIS IS EVERYONE THAT WAS SIGNED UP PRIOR TO
THE MEETING.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: I THINK WE SKIPPED OVER SIMON?

>> I'M A JUNIOR STUDYING AT MIT. MY COMMUNITY AND I WILL BE
DISHEARTENED TO SEE THIS PASS. I THINK THIS IGNORES THE REALITY THAT
THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE SITUATION AND THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS
HAVE BEEN FIRED TO ISRAEL IN THE LAST WEEKS. TO IGNORE IT IS BEYOND
PROBLEMATIC. AND THE BDS RESOLUTION IS NOT ALLOWING MORE VOICES
TO BE HEARD. NOT OPENING UP DISCUSSION OR DIALOGUE, BUT IT SHUTS
DOWN ANY EFFORTS FOR RECONCILIATION. THAT'S ALL I WILL SAY.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP? AVI?
>> HELLO. AVI. I LIVED ON HARVARD STREET FOR EIGHT YEARS. I JOIN
TONIGHT TO OPPOSE THE POLICY ORDER. I HAVE BEEN A STUDENT IN
CAMBRIDGE, I HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED IN CAMBRIDGE, AND I STARTED A
FAMILY IN CAMBRIDGE. THE CITY IS MY HOME AND I NEVER FELT unsafe OR
UNWANTED UNTIL THIS WEEK. THE SKY ROCKET OF ANTISemitic ATTACKS IN
THE UNITED STATES AND THE RESOLUTION TO DIVEST FROM ISRAELI
COUNTRIES FROM THE CITY I CALL HOME, MADE ME RETHINK MY SAFETY. WE
CAN BE ANTIZIONIST AND NOT ANTISEMITIC, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ARGUE
AGAINST. I'M NOT A LAWYER NOT AN EXPERT IN THE CONFLICT, I'M AN
AMERICAN JEW LIVING IN CAMBRIDGE. EXPRESSING MY CONCERN FOR MY
SAFETY TO MY COUNCILLORS. I WOULD STAY UP UNTIL 2:00 TO EXPRESS THIS.
I URGE YOU TO UPHOLD MY COMFORT AND SAFETY BY VOTING AGAIN THIS
POLICY. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: NEXT UP? IT SAID WE SKIPPED OVER JOAN. WE MAY
HAVE HEARD FROM JOAN. CAN YOU CONFIRM?
>> JOAN WHITAKER?
>> YOU HAVE HEARD FROM ME.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: OKAY. THERE ARE TEN HANDS UP.
>> SOME HANDS HAVE GONE BACK UP DESPITE HAVING SPOKEN ALREADY. I
BELIEVE WE ARE DONE.
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THERE'S JARED. IT SAYS SKIPPED ON MY LIST. HIS HAND
IS UP.
>> HI. I'M TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICY ORDERS. THERE'S BEEN A
POINT THAT IS RAISED A FEW TIMES ABOUT DIALOGUE BEING THE WAY
FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT BRING THIS UP
WHERE THEY THINK BDS CAME FROM. IF YOU LOOK, SOME OF THE REASONS
WHY BDS CAME INTO FORM, GIVEN ALL FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL
PEACEMAKING HAVE FAILED TO CONVINCE OR FORCE ISRAEL TO COMPLY...
ET CETERA, THAT'S WHY PARTLY THE CAMPAIGN CAME ABOUT. YOU CAN'T
HAVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN A colonizer AND THE COLONIZED AND
DISPROPORTIONATE DIFFERENCES IN POWER WHERE EVERY I CAN GO ON
WITH MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW DISPROPORTIONATE IT IS BETWEEN THE
TWO SIDES. DIALOGUE IS VERY
>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI: THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. I THINK THAT'S
EVERYONE. FROM WHAT I AM SEEING.

GOING ON, YOU DID A FABULOUS JOB AND I SEND MY THANKS TO THE STAFF.
