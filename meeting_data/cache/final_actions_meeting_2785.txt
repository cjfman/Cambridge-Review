2. Tree #14 is noted as being removed to accommodate the new accessible ADA compliant
ramp.

4. Tunneling shall be the preferred method of excavation adjacent to tree roots to avoid root
pruning. If root pruning is unavoidable, certified personnel shall execute the operation with
sufficiently sharpened hand tools and in such a fashion as to have minimum negative impact on
tree health and safety.
5. Trucks and heavy equipment shall not pass over or park on roots of public shade trees. A
protection zone shall be established by erecting a rigid fence outside the perimeter of the
dripline of the tree. For occasional or one-time access over roots, ½’ plywood overlapped may
be used. Permeable materials such as gravel or wood chips shall be placed over root systems
of trees which are not covered by hardscape and over which trucks and heavy equipment must
travel during construction operations, when such travel is unavoidable, to prevent soil
compaction and root damage. Material shall be replaced as needed.
