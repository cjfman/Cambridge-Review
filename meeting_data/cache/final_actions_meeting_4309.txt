Next Steps – Onsite Renewables

Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan Update:

• Set target for GHG emissions by 2030 by 12/31/23
• Will include onsite renewables target

Packet Pg. 17

Onsite
Renewables
– Other
Highlights

• Unlike most communities, the City of Cambridge
self-funds its PV systems in order to retain the rights
to claim the greenhouse gas reductions
• Keeping photovoltaic (PV) systems in top operating
condition ensures that they generate the maximum
amount of energy. The FY24 budget includes funds to
support a comprehensive program to maintain and
monitor all City-owned solar PV systems.

In 2022, the City reduced greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) from municipal operations 38% below 2008 levels. The chart also depicts
the significant impact of the planned procurement of 100% renewable electricity supply from a new renewable system estimated to
begin operating on or about Dec. 2025.

Net Zero Action Plan Policies

Attachment: H&E Committee Hearing_RenewableEnergy_041123sr (COF 2023 #64 : A

NZAP Smart Goal: 55MW in City
and City Properties by 2030

Action 3.2.1: Rooftop Solar Requirements
• Short-term: adopt a solar installation requirement for new
construction
▪ Interacts with Action 2.1 Net Zero New Construction
Requirements/Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration Program
▪ Specialized Stretch Code requires solar, where feasible,
if building utilizes fossil fuels
• Medium-term: consider solar installation requirements for
existing buildings, such as upon roof replacement

Action 3.2.2: Community Solar Access
• Short-term: design and launch a community solar program to
install solar on open roofs to benefit LMI population and
residents without access to solar
Action 3.3: Off-Site Renewable Electricity Access
• Short-term: continue to pursue impactful renewable
electricity sources for Cambridge Community Electricity
aggregation program, with goal of giving all buildings access
to at least 50% RE by 2025 and 100% by 2030

Cambridge Community Electricity (CCE)
243kW solar project on Graham and Parks School
• Over 40,000 CCE accounts pay a $0.002 charge on each kWh
of electricity they use to the City Revolving Fund
• All the RECs from this solar project were retired on behalf of
the Community Electricity Program participants, reducing
their carbon emissions.
• All the solar net metering credits will be sold and the funds
re-invested in the revolving fund.
• This solar project is collectively “owned” by all the
Cambridge Community Electricity Program participants
• The electricity produced by this new solar project will take
the place of some fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Almost 1,700 CCE participants have opted up to 100% Green Plus, the
current 100% renewable electricity option through CCE

• Procurement of electricity supply contract
for aggregation starting January 2024
• Structure the amount of renewable
electricity in the default CCE offer for 2024
